in particular, pl2 and pl3 respond differentially to a walker b mutation in either nbd1 or nbd2, as well as to mutations in both. we characterize the conformational dynamics of pore loops and the allosteric paths connecting nbds to pore loops by molecular dynamics simulations and find that both principal motions and allosteric paths can be altered by changing the atpase state of clpb. remarkably, pl3, which is highly conserved in aaa+ machines, is found to favor an upward conformation when only nbd1 undergoes atp hydrolysis, but a downward conformation when nbd2 is active. these results explicitly demonstrate a significant long-range allosteric effect of atp hydrolysis sites on pore-loop dynamics. pore loops are therefore established as active participants that undergo atp-dependent conformational changes to translocate substrate proteins through the central pores of aaa+ machines.  statement of significancemolecular machines function by coupling the energy of atp hydrolysis to mechanical motion. how this coupling occurs and what timescales are involved remains an open question. in this study, we use a powerful single-molecule fret technique to measure the real-time dynamics of pore loops, which are essential protein-translocating elements of the atp-dependent disaggregation machine clpb. using a series of mutations of the atp-hydrolysis motifs of clpb, we find that, although the motions of these pore loops take place on the microsecond time scale, they are markedly affected by the much slower changes in the nucleotide state of the machine. generally, this study shows that protein machines, such as clpb, are wired to harness atp binding and hydrolysis to allosterically affect distal events, such as the function-related mechanics of pore-loops."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.08.556893", "Publication Date": "2024-01-09 00:00:00", "Title": "elf1 promotes rad26 interaction with lesion-arrested pol ii for transcription-coupled repair", "Authors": "['Sarsam, R.;

models, a strategy we refer to as proteochemometrics (pcm). similarly, the use of alphafold latent embeddings within a generative model for small molecules allows it to leverage structural relationships between proteins. this opens up new possibilities such as interpolation within the chemical space of known highly active compounds and extrapolation on the target side based on their similarities to other proteins, which is especially relevant for understudied or novel targets. our results indicate that pcmol can generate diverse, potentially active molecules for a wide array of proteins, including those with sparse ligand bioactivity data. we also benchmark against existing target-conditioned trans-former models to illustrate the validity of using alphafold protein representations to steer the molecular generation process and increase the generalization capabilities to unseen targets. additionally, we demonstrate the important role of data augmentation in bolstering the performance of generative models in low-data regimes. the open-source package along with a dataset of alphafold protein embeddings is available at https://github.com/cddleiden/pcmol."},

industrial cement production could be reduced if the high-temperature kilns used to decompose limestone (caco3(s)) were replaced. one possible solution is to use electrochemical reactors to convert caco3(s) into ca(oh)2(s). the challenge is that the continuous-flow electrochemical reactors reported to date all require voltages that are too high (>4 v at 100 ma cm\u20132) to be put into practice. a key reason for these high voltages is that the reactors contain a chemical chamber, inserted between the anode and cathode chambers, that leads to a high ohmic resistance. in this study, we present an electrolyzer that decomposes caco3(s) into reactive ca2+ ions using only two chambers. this cell design, with an anode and cathode chamber separated by a membrane instead of a chemical chamber, follows a \u201czero-gap\u201d design akin to hydrogen-producing electrolyzers and fuel cells. this cement electrolyzer is capable of operating at a full cell voltage (ecell) of merely 0.38 v at 100 ma cm\u20132, and with 100% faradaic efficiency (fe). this strikingly low ecell is 1.4 v lower than any other reported ecell. we achieved this goal by not only eliminating the chemical chamber, but by also engaging the reversible redox activity of (hydro)anthraquinones to mediate oxidation and reduction within a narrow electrochemical window. this streamlined reactor is capable of operating at a record low voltages of 0.38 v at 100 ma cm\u20132, and 4.23 v at 1 a cm\u20132."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m7h5c", "Publication Date": "2024-02-21 00:00:00", "Title":

magnesium, for orthopedic implants. this is driven by their potential to address challenges like stress shielding and the need for secondary removal surgery. in this study, biodegradable magnesium alloys were produced using the vacuum induction casting technique. the impact of micro-alloying zn and ca in mg-xzn-0.2ca (x= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 wt%) alloys on corrosion resistance, cytocompatibility, and early-stage inflammatory response was investigated. xrd and sem-eds analysis confirmed the presence of ca2mg6zn3 secondary phases in all alloys. the mg-0.3zn-0.2ca alloy exhibited the lowest corrosion rate and an elastic modulus of 33.7 gpa, resembling that of natural bone. electrochemical measurements indicated a correlation between grain size and secondary phase volume fraction in explaining corrosion behaviour. in vitro degradation in simulated body fluid (sbf) for 21 days showed hydroxyapatite formation on alloy surfaces, aligning with electrochemical studies. in vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrated the cytocompatibility of all alloys, with mg-0.3zn-0.2ca having the highest cell viability over a 6-day cell culture. investigation into the inflammatory response with raw-blue macrophages revealed the anti-inflammatory properties of mg-0.3zn-0.2ca alloys. micro-alloying with 0.3 wt% zn and 0.2 wt% ca enhanced mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, cytocompatibility, and immunomodulatory properties. this positions the mg-0.3zn-0.2ca alloy as a promising biodegradable implant for bone fixation applications."}, {"Link/DOI":

"Authors": "Seth Cory Cheng-Wei Lin Steven Havens Shachin Patra Christopher Putnam Mehdi Shirzadeh David Russell David Barondeau", "Abstract": "iron-sulfur clusters are essential protein cofactors synthesized in human mitochondria by an nfs1-isd11-acp-iscu2-fxn assembly complex. surprisingly, researchers have discovered three distinct quaternary structures for cysteine desulfurase subcomplexes, which display similar interactions between nfs1-isd11-acp protomeric units but distinct dimeric interfaces between the protomers. although the role of these different architectures is unclear, possible functions include regulating activity and promoting the biosynthesis of distinct sulfur-containing biomolecules. here, crystallography, native ion-mobility mass spectrometry, and chromatography methods reveal the fe-s assembly subcomplex exists as an equilibrium mixture of these different quaternary structures. our results suggest friedreich's ataxia (frda) protein frataxin (fxn) functions as a \"molecular lock\" and shifts the equilibrium towards one of the architectures to stimulate the cysteine desulfurase activity and promote iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. an nfs1-designed variant similarly shifts the equilibrium and partially replaces fxn in activating the complex. these results suggest that eukaryotic cysteine desulfurases are unusual members of the morpheein class of enzymes that control their activity through their oligomeric state. overall, the findings support architectural switching as a regulatory mechanism linked to fxn activation of the human fe-s cluster biosynthetic complex and provide new opportunities for therapeutic interventions of the fatal neurodegenerative disease frda.

through a transphosphoesterification reaction. while this process is involved in some specific steps of viral rna replication and splicing, it is also of importance in the context of the (putative) first autocatalytic rna-based systems that could have preceded the emergence of modern life. the uncatalyzed phosphoesterbond formation is thermodynamically very unfavorable, and many experimental studies have focused on the understanding of the molecular features of catalysis in these ribozymes. however, chemical reaction paths are short-lived and not easily characterized by experimental approaches, so that molecular simulation approaches appear as an ideal tool to unveil the molecular details of the reaction. here, we focus on the model hairpin ribozyme and highlight that identifying a relevant initial conformation for reactivity studies can be highly challenging due to limitations in both available x-ray and the force field accuracy, together with the necessity of extensive sampling. this is frequently overlooked in mixed quantum/classical studies that predominantly concentrate on the chemical reaction itself. these challenges stem from limitations in both available experimental structures (which are chemically altered to prevent self-cleavage) and the accuracy of force fields, together with the necessity for comprehensive sampling. we show that molecular dynamics simulations, combined with extensive conformational phase space exploration with hamiltonian replica-exchange simulations, enable to characterize the relevant conformational basins of the minimal hairpin ribozyme in the ligated state, prior to self-cleavage. with all investigated force fields, we find that what is usually considered as a canonical reactive conformation with active site geometries and hydrogen-bond patterns that are optimal for the addition-elimination reaction with general acid/general base catalysis, is metastable and only marginally populated. the thermodynamically stable conformation appears to be consistent with the expectations of a mechanism that does not require the direct participation of ribozyme residues to the reaction. our study

promising for creating vascular parts such as tubes, developing branched networks or tubular junctions is still challenging. here, for the first time, a 4d printing approach is employed to fabricate t-shaped perfusable bifurcation using an extrusion-based multi-material 3d printing process. an alginate/methylcellulose-based dual-component hydrogel system (with defined swelling behavior) is nanoengineered with carbonized alginate (~100 nm) to introduce anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties and shape-shifting properties. a computational model to predict shape deformations in the printed hydrogels with defined infill angles was designed and further validated experimentally. shape deformations of the 3d-printed flat sheets were achieved by ionic cross-linking. an undisrupted perfusion of a dye solution through a t-junction with minimal leakage mimicking blood flow through vessels is also demonstrated. moreover, human umbilical vein endothelial and fibroblast cells seeded with printed constructs show intact morphology and excellent cell viability. overall, developed strategy paves the way for manufacturing self-actuated vascular

the body. mutations in the hiyd gene are linked to human hypothyroidism, emphasizing its role in thyroid function regulation. the present work employs microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the conformational dynamics and reactivity in the active site at various stages of hiyd catalysis. the flavin is found to employ a unique butterfly motion of its isoalloxazine ring accompanied by a novel active-and-resting state of its ribose 2\u2032-oh group during the catalytic cycle. the flavin dynamics is found to control substrate binding affinity, the active site lid closure, and nadph recognition. the enzyme uses a group of basic residues (r100, r101, r104, k182, and r279) to stabilize flavin at different stages of catalysis, suggesting potential mutations to control enzyme activity. the reactivity descriptor analysis and stereo-electronic analysis predict the n5 nitrogen of flavin as a proton source during the reductive

\u2018droplets\u2019 composed of dna nanostars, where nanostars with distinct dna sequences form both the cytosolic core and the membrane-like shell. nanostar properties were first explored to understand how structural changes in geometry, valency, and interaction strength affect phase-separation temperature, size, stability, and permeability. we show that when pairs of nanostars self-assemble in the same solution, the order of phase-separation determines core or shell destination, while the proportion of surfactant nanostars that link the two populations determines shell morphology. for 3 different core nanostars, we demonstrate a range of shell nanostars with different material properties and morphologies. membrane-like systems, where the shell fully encloses the core, form if the difference in phase-separation temperatures of the two nanostars is greater than 7c with 16-25% surfactant nanostars. core-shell droplets were more cell-like, with well-defined size, stability over time, and core permeability controlled by shell properties. furthermore, droplet size and membrane thickness were controlled by adjusting the thermal annealing rate during assembly. these techniques provide a diverse library of droplets suitable to be used as protocells with predictable size, mono-dispersity, membrane thickness, and permeability. core-shell dna nanostar droplets will open new avenues for programming dynamic cell-like behaviour in simplified systems that combine dna protocells with dna molecular circuits.

sequence motifs that distinguish them from homologous short-chain dehydrogenases and reductases. sequence motif 1, carrying a conserved threonine, glycine and a central aromatic residue, lines the nucleophile binding pocket of hhdhs. it could therefore impact nucleophile binding and presumably also activity of the enzymes. however, experimental evidence supporting this theory is largely missing. herein, we systematically studied the mutability of the three conserved motif 1 residues as well as their resulting impact on enzyme activity, stability and selectivity in two model hhdhs: hhec from agrobacterium radiobacter ad1 and hheg from ilumatobacter coccineus. in both hhec and hheg, the conserved threonine and glycine only tolerated mutations to structurally similar amino acids. in contrast, the central aromatic (i.e., phenylalanine or tyrosine) residue of motif 1 demonstrated much higher variability in hhec. remarkably, some of these variants featured drastically altered activity, stability and selectivity characteristics. for instance, variant hhec f12y displayed up to 5-fold increased specific activity in various epoxide ring opening and dehalogenation reactions as well as enhanced enantioselectivity (e.g., an e-value of 74 in the azidolysis of epichlorohydrin compared to e = 22 for hhec wild type), while exhibiting also a 10 k higher apparent melting temperature. qm and md simulations support the experimentally observed activity increase of hhec f12y and revealed alterations in the hydrogen bonding network within the active site. as such, our results demonstrate that multiple enzyme properties of hhdhs can be altered through targeted mutagenesis of conserved motif 1 residues. in addition, this work illustrates that motif 1 plays vital roles beyond nucleophile binding by impacting solubility and stability properties. these insights advance our understanding of hhdh active sites and will facilitate their future engineering.

a molecule. here, we propose a framework for molecular machine learning tasks based on set representation learning. we show that learning on sets of atomic invariants alone reaches the performance of state-of-the-art graph-based models on the most-used chemical benchmark data sets and that introducing a set representation layer into graph neural networks can surpass the performance of established methods in the domains of chemistry, biology, and material science. we introduce specialised set representation-based neural network architectures for reaction yield and protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. overall, we show that the technique we denote molecular set representation learning is both an alternative and an extension to graph neural network architectures for machine learning tasks on molecules, molecule complexes, and chemical reactions."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tsvkq", "Publication Date": "2024-03-15 00:00:00", "Title":

herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4'-thiouridine in a one-pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new functional entities. this methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4'-thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. we exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5-iodo-4'-thiouridine on multi-milligram scale and from here switch to the chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5-ethynyl-4'-thiouridine. finally, we demonstrate the utility of
