H.; Mansi, J. A.']","backgroundthree years into the pandemic, sars-cov-2 remains a significant burden in comparison to other respiratory illnesses; however, many of the monitoring tools available during the early phase of the covid-19 pandemic have been phased out, making it more difficult to track the current burden of outpatient medical encounters and hospitalizations, especially for at-risk groups. the objective of this analysis was to characterize the frequency and severity of medically-attended covid-19 and influenza during peak influenza activity in the pediatric (0-17), adult (18-64), and older adult (65+) populations and characterize the prevalence of underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with covid-19.  methodsthis was a cross-sectional analysis of individuals in the veradigm health insights ehr database linked to komodo claims data with a medical encounter of claim between october 1, 2022, and march 31, 2023. we captured age, sex, and underlying medical conditions associated with higher risk for severe covid-19 during a 12-month baseline period. we identified patients with medical encounters with a diagnosis of covid-19 or influenza between october 1, 2022, and march 31, 2023, and stratified them into 5 mutually exclusive categories based on the highest level of care received with that diagnosis during the season (intensive care unit [icu] > hospitalization without icu > emergency department > urgent care > other outpatient).  resultsamong the 23,526,196 individuals in the dataset, 5.0% had a covid-19-related medical encounter, and 3.0% had an influenza-related medical encounter during the 6 month observation period. the incidence of hospitalizations with a covid-19 diagnosis was 4.6 times higher than the incidence of hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis. hospitalizations with covid-19 were higher in all age groups. nearly all adults hospitalized with covid-19 had at least one underlying medical condition, but 25.8% of 0-5-year-olds and 18.3% of 6-17-year-olds had no underlying medical conditions.  conclusionscovid-19 continues to place a heavy burden on the united states healthcare system and was associated with more medical encounters in all age groups, including hospitalizations, than influenza during a 6-month period that included the 2022-2023 peak influenza activity."

A.']","covid-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented level of restrictive measures globally. most countries resorted to lockdowns at some point to buy the much-needed time for flattening the curve and scaling up vaccination and treatment capacity. although lockdowns, social distancing and business closures generally slowed down the case growth, there is a growing concern about the social, economic and psychological impact of these restrictions, especially on the disadvantaged and poorer part of society. while we are all in this together, these segments are often taking the heavier toll of the pandemic and facing harsher restrictions or getting blamed for community transmission. this study tries to explore this perspective using quantitative analysis and network theory. the research is set in the context of the latest delta and omicron outbreaks in the greater sydney area, australia, during late 2021. we first try to model how the local road networks between the neighbouring suburbs (i.e., neighbourhood measure) and current infection count affect the case growth and how they differ between delta and omicron variants. we use a geographic information system, population and infection data to measure - road connections, mobility and transmission probability across the suburbs. we then looked at three socio-demographic variables - age, education and income and explored how they moderate independent and dependent variables (infection rates and neighbourhood measures). the result shows strong model performance to predict infection rate based on neighbourhood road connection. however, apart from age in the delta variants context, the other two variables - income and education level do not seem to moderate the relation between infection rate and neighbourhood measure. the results indicate that suburbs with a more socio- economically disadvantaged population do not necessarily contribute to more community transmission. the study findings could be potentially helpful for stakeholders in tailoring any health decision for future pandemics."

95% ci: -30{middle dot}0-65{middle dot}6) appeared to wane with confidence intervals spanning the null.  interpretationa single-dose of euvichol-plus(r) provided substantial protection against medically attended cholera for at least 36 months post-vaccination in this cholera endemic setting. while our evidence provides support for comparable levels of protection in young children and others in the short-term, protection among young children may wane significantly by the third year after vaccination.  fundingwellcome trust and gavi (gavi-rfp-2019-062).  research in contexto_st_absevidence before this studyc_st_absin late 2022, due to increasing demand for killed, whole-cell, oral cholera vaccines (kocv) and limited production capacity, the international coordinating group (the organization managing emergency stocks of kocvs) changed policy to deploy single-dose, rather than the standard two-dose regimen, for emergency vaccination campaigns. this decision was in line with who guidance on the use of a single dose in outbreaks, where short-term protection is key. however, this recommendation is based on a limited number of clinical studies with short-term follow-up. there is also limited evidence on the magnitude and duration of protection conferred by a single dose of kocv, particularly in children under five years of age.  we searched pubmed for randomized trials and observational studies published in english before november 1, 2023, that reported estimates of protection conferred by a single dose of kocv, using the term ""(effectiveness or efficacy) and cholera* and vaccine"". we found no published studies estimating the effectiveness of a single dose of euvichol-plus(r), and only one study reporting two-dose effectiveness. despite this paucity of evidence, this is the only vaccine currently available in the global stockpile. to date, there has been one randomized trial conducted in bangladesh between 2014 and 2016, and seven observational studies conducted between 2009 and 2016 in guinea, haiti, india, malawi, sudan, zambia and zanzibar, reporting effectiveness estimates of a single dose of the current generation of kocv. aside from the trial in bangladesh, all estimates were based on secondary analyses that the studies were not powered to estimate. the bangladesh trial is the only study to date that provides an age-stratified estimate of single-dose protection, and while it found an overall protective efficacy of 62% (95% ci: 43- 75) during the 2-year follow up for individuals aged five years or older, it found no significant protection conferred by the shanchol kocv (a bioequivalent of euvichol-plus(r)) for individuals under five years of age (protective efficacy: -44%, 95% ci -220 to 35). four of the seven observational studies provide single-dose vaccine effectiveness (ve) estimates only during the first 12 months post-vaccination with estimates ranging from 43% (95% ci -84-82) in guinea to 93% (95% ci 69-98) in haiti. the three other observational studies providing a single dose ve estimate between 12-30 months post-vaccination were unable to demonstrate statistically significant protection conferred by kocv, with estimates ranging between 32{middle dot}5% (95% ci - 318{middle dot}0-89{middle dot}1) in india and 40% (95% ci -31-73) in haiti. no vaccine protection estimates have been published from the two identified cholera endemic foci in africa, the democratic republic of the congo and nigeria.  added value of this studyin this vaccine effectiveness study, we show that a single dose of euvichol-plus(r) vaccine can provide significant protection against medically attended cholera for up to 36 months after vaccination in a cholera endemic setting in africa, though protection in children under five years old remains unclear. these estimates help fill critical gaps in our understanding of the magnitude and duration of protection from a single dose of the most widely used kocv, euvichol-plus(r) and is one of only a few studies to measure protection in an endemic setting in africa.  implications of all the available evidencethe corpus of available evidence suggests that use of a single dose of kocv in emergency situations where cholera is endemic, like uvira, is justified and that providing a second dose within the first 12-24 months post-vaccination may only provide marginal benefit to the general population. however, more evidence and analyses are needed to weigh the costs and benefits of tailored vaccination approaches for those under five years old, including possibility of providing a second dose at an earlier timepoint."
