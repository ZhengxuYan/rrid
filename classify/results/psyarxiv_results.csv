https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5yj2v,2024-03-20,Don’t Believe Them! Reducing Misinformation Influence Through Source Discreditation,To be fetched,"Misinformation often continues to influence people’s reasoning even after it has been corrected. Therefore, an important aim of applied cognition research is to identify effective measures to counter misinformation. One frequently recommended but hitherto insufficiently tested strategy is source discreditation, that is, attacking the credibility of a misinformation source. In two experiments, we tested whether source-discreditation interventions could reduce people’s subsequent reliance on fictional event-related misinformation. In Experiment 1, the discreditation targeted a person source of misinformation, pointing to a conflict of interest. This intervention was compared with a commonly employed message-focused correction and a combination of both a correction and discreditation. The discreditation alone was effective, but less effective than a correction, with the combination of both most effective. Experiment 2 compared discreditations that targeted a person versus a media source of misinformation, pointing either to a conflict of interest or a poor track record of communication. Discreditations were effective for both types of sources, although track-record discreditations were less effective when the misinformation source was a media outlet compared to a person. Results demonstrate that continued influence of misinformation is shaped by social as well as cognitive factors, and that source discreditation is a broadly applicable misinformation countermeasure."

However, there is limited longitudinal research in this field and there has been little consideration of factors (such as positive family relationships) that may protect victimized adolescents against developing appearance dissatisfaction. This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between peer victimization and appearance dissatisfaction among early adolescents, as well as investigate the potential moderating role of positive parenting in these associations. This study used data from two consecutive waves of the UK Longitudinal Household Study (UKLHS). Participants were early adolescents (aged 10 years) and their parents (n = 309 dyads). Adolescents self-reported on appearance dissatisfaction (age 10 and age 11) and peer victimization (age 10), and parents provided self-report parenting practices. Peer victimization at 10 years old was positively correlated with concurrent appearance dissatisfaction. However, it did not predict changes in appearance dissatisfaction from age 10 to 11 years. No significant moderating effect of positive parenting was found. In general, adolescents with a history of peer victimization are more likely to experience higher levels of concurrent appearance dissatisfaction, but not increases in appearance dissatisfaction over time. Furthermore, among victimized adolescents, having a warm, caring, and responsive parent may not protect against negative body image. This study highlights the need for school-based interventions in tackling appearance dissatisfaction."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4wnfv,2024-03-20,The wolf or the sheep? Paranoid and teleological thinking give rise to distinct social hallucinations in vision,To be fetched,"Paranoia (belief that others intend harm) and excessive teleological thinking (ascription of purpose to events) are problematic because they can cause a departure from consensual reality. Aberrant theorizing about other minds has been implicated in these higher-level cognitive processes. But we know that human vision can also detect social agents and extract rich information about their goals and intentions even before higher-level theory-of-mind processes are engaged. Might paranoia and teleological thinking have roots in earlier visual perception? Using simple displays that evoke the impression that one disc (the ‘wolf’) is pursuing another (the ‘sheep’) amongst distractors, we find that human participants with more paranoid and excessive teleological thinking tend to perceive chasing even when there is none (experiments 1 and 2) — errors that might be characterized as “social hallucinations”. However, in both between- (experiment 3) and within-participant designs (experiments 4a and 4b), we find that paranoid people have problems detecting sheep, while those high in teleology have problems detecting wolves — each confidently mis-ascribing that role (the wolf for teleology, the sheep for paranoia) to the wrong discs. Moreover, both types of errors correlate with hallucinatory percepts in the real world. These data demonstrate that different people are prone to hallucinate different kinds of social relationships — each colored by different beliefs about intentions, each with their own phenomenology and cognitive/emotional consequences, yet each operating even in visual detection itself, beyond higher-level reasoning."

This pre-registered study fills this gap by investigating possible links between pandemic regulations and positive outcomes, namely school well-being. Specifically, we test the assumption that high-ability early adolescents benefit from virtual schooling by experiencing higher school well-being while schooled virtually. Data from a Czech sample (N = 210) do not support this claim but show a strong effect of autonomy on school well- being. We also explore the changes reported by our participants after returning to classrooms."

This semantic interference effect in blocked-cyclic naming plays an important role in devising theories of word production. Wöhner et al. (2021) have shown that the effect is substantially larger when participants name environmental sounds than when they name pictures. We investigated possible reasons for this difference, using EEG and pupillometry. The behavioral data replicated Wöhner and colleagues. ERPs were more positive in the homogeneous compared to the heterogeneous context over central electrode locations between 140−180 ms and 250−350 ms for picture and between 250−350 ms for sound naming presumably reflecting semantic interference during semantic and lexical processing. The later component was of similar size for pictures and sounds. ERPs were more negative in the homogeneous compared to the heterogeneous context over frontal electrode locations between 400−600 ms only for sounds. The pupillometric data showed a stronger pupil dilation in the homogeneous compared to the heterogeneous context only for sounds. The amplitudes of the late ERP negativity and pupil dilation predicted naming latencies for sounds in the homogeneous context. The latency of the effects indicates that the difference in semantic interference between picture and sound naming arises at later, presumably post-lexical processing stages closer to articulation. We suggest that the processing of the auditory stimuli interferes with phonological response preparation and self-monitoring, leading to enhanced semantic interference."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/t9hac,2024-03-20,Time to Abandon “Born This Way” Narratives?  Moral Motivations Shape Sexual Orientation Essentialism,To be fetched,"For decades, positive attitudes towards lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people have converged around “born this way” narratives, describing LGB identities as natural, stable, and immutable. However, recent scholarship has argued that sexual orientation essentialism should be abandoned because of its scientific inaccuracy and its implication that the validity of LGB identities must be justified. Across three studies (N=750), we presented participants with either a passage promoting “born this way” narratives or a passage critiquing “born this way” narratives. Those in the “Born this way”-critical conditions demonstrated significantly less sexual orientation essentialism than those in the “Born this way”-supportive conditions, with condition effects particularly strong among liberals. Crucially, effects on essentialism were similar regardless of whether the critique was grounded in epistemic reasons (i.e., “born this way” narratives are inaccurate) or moral motivations (i.e., “born this way” narratives are harmful). There were no condition differences in pro-LGB attitudes or warmth. Thus, moral motivations can prompt the strategic wielding of essentialism. We suggest that, while essentialism can causally shape social attitudes and drive social progress for identities once believed to be a matter of choice, essentialism may be abandoned in favor of more nuanced narratives once these identities have achieved a certain level of legitimacy."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gbcxq,2024-03-20,A Rational Trade-Off Between the Costs and Benefits of Automatic and Controlled Processing,To be fetched,"The Stroop effect suggests that humans arbitrate between automatic and controlled processing. Previous work argues that this arbitration reflects a cost-benefit analysis, weighing cognitive effort against performance. However, it is unclear how these costs and benefits can be quantified and how the trade-off between them can be performed. We present a Bayesian network model of the Stroop effect in which actions are selected by minimizing variational free energy. Based on this approach, we derive information-theoretic measures of the costs and benefits of both automatic and controlled processing and show that minimizing free energy optimizes the trade-off between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the so-called congruency and proportion congruency effects in the Stroop task are the result of this optimization, in an environment that contains specific statistical regularities. Thereby, we provide an explicit account of when and how much automatic and controlled processing should be expected under a rational trade-off."

We argue that stewarding the Earth System away from instability requires an embrace of expansive perspectives that drive effective action. Past perspectives underscore the importance of ‘expansiveness’ for prosocial behaviour, including both a more inclusive moral universe and an extended self-concept. Across two studies (N = 546), assessed via the well-established Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and identification processes. Specifically, we employed a tailored version of the MES to scrutinize self-identity and its relative expansiveness. Study 1 revealed a significant relationship between moral concern and self-expansion, yet each exhibited distinct patterns, displaying discriminant validity. The degree of identification with an entity, especially nature-related ones, related to moral concern judgments associated with it, offering fresh insights into moral expansiveness. In Study 2, individuals demonstrating broader and deeper moral circles, alongside a more inclusive self-concept, exhibited heightened tendencies to identify as environmental activists and engage in pro-environmental activism. However, neither construct predicted signing the Climate and Ecology Bill, indicating the need for further investigation into factors influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This paper extends research into environmental activism by examining the unique contribution of expansiveness in moral circles and the self-concept, shedding light on individuals' prosocial engagement with the natural world."

How does this company help or hinder word learning? Prior investigations into early word learning from children’s real-world language input have yielded conflicting results, with some influential findings suggesting an advantage for words that keep a diverse company of other words, and others suggesting the opposite. Here, we sought to triangulate the source of this conflict, comparing different measures of diversity and approaches to controlling for correlated effects of word frequency across multiple languages. The results were striking: while different diversity measures on their own yielded conflicting results, once nonlinear relationships with word frequency were controlled, we found convergent evidence that contextual consistency supports early word learning."

Danish tests of children’s motor functioning, which are currently available, are outdated and only applicable up to the age of seven years old. New tools are needed to enable easy and efficient screening of motor difficulties experienced by children living in Denmark. Aims/Objectives: We aimed to translate and adapt the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ) into Danish. Materials and Methods: A team of translators prepared the Danish version of the DCDQ. In total, 36 parents completed the questionnaire. The children completed fine and gross motor coordination tasks. Concurrent validity was tested using Pearson correlation on the DCDQ and motor performance scores. Internal consistency was tested using Cronbach’s alpha. Results: The results show good concurrent validity (r=.311) and internal consistency (α=.80). Conclusions: The Danish version of the DCDQ is well suited for use with Danish-speaking parents. Significance: The tool will aid early assessment of motor difficulties in children of Danish-speaking parents. The Danish DCDQ can be used by educational, occupational and health professionals as well as researchers in national and international contexts."

Further, we found that people who were motivated to leave a legacy grounded in the desire to have a positive impact on others also tended to be more concerned about climate change, but not paralyzed by such concern, indicated by a negative or non-significant correlation with climate change anxiety, a positive correlation with constructive hope and active coping, and negative correlations with hope based in denial and avoidant coping."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/j6825,2024-03-20,Chatbots and mental health: A scoping review of reviews,To be fetched,"The majority of individuals presenting with mental disorders do not receive mental health services. The use of chatbots for mental health is now frequently discussed as a means to increase access to mental health resources. For this scoping review of reviews on chatbots for mental health, we performed a systematic search of the literature on Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed and Dimensions.ai and identified 14 relevant reviews published in scientific journals which identified publications following a systematic search on two or more databases. Three additional relevant reviews were included following forward and backward reference examination. The 17 included reviews are: eight systematic reviews (three with meta-analysis), seven scoping reviews and two unlabeled reviews. We have summarized the scope of the reviews as well as their findings. Most reviews included at least one study with 15 participants or less. Few reviews report an important proportion of RCTs and some original publications most of the time report on piloting studies. Overall, the reviews examined the opinions of users of chatbots (generally good user’s perceptions although some find deterrents), the features of chatbots, the outcomes and measures in studies relying on chatbots, the effectiveness of chatbots (particularly the meta-analyses) for the alleviation of mental disorder symptomatology (three meta-analyses find effectiveness for depression, whereas other clinical targets might need further research) as well as their potential for the assessment of mental health. The use of machine learning and natural language processing frameworks (Dialogflow, RASA) seems to drive an increasing number of studies of chatbots for mental health. Overall, we conclude that there is potential for the use of chatbots for mental health, but that progress is necessary in following areas affecting interaction dynamics: reduction of the frequent lack of empathy and repetitiveness, inclusion of user assessment within the chatbot system, inclusion of a memory of past interactions. Large language models might be capable of reducing part of these issues and playing an increasingly important role in the field. Whether data privacy can be guaranteed to users is also an important question, which seems to be overlooked in the field."

In order to conduct faster, more reproducible, and larger-scale corpus studies on grammaticality in child-caregiver conversations, tools for automatic annotation can offer an effective alternative to tedious manual annotation. We propose a coding scheme for context-dependent grammaticality in child-caregiver conversations and annotate more than 4,000 utterances from a large corpus of transcribed conversations. Based on these annotations, we train and evaluate a range of NLP models. Our results show that fine-tuned Transformer-based models perform best, achieving human inter-annotation agreement levels. As a first application and sanity check of this tool, we use the trained models to annotate a corpus that is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the manually annotated data and verify that children's grammaticality shows a steady increase with age. This work contributes to the growing literature on applying state-of-the-art NLP methods to help study child language acquisition at scale."

The theory of learning progress predicts that people will have the most fun in environments of intermediate difficulty because these environments offer the most progress in learning about the world. Past studies have frequently focused on simple experimental paradigms in which learning was still instrumental for later tasks. Here, we put the theory of fun as learning progress to a test in three large and realistic video game data sets: a puzzle game (with 7,994 levels and 376,341 votes), a racing game (138,662 levels and 614,770 votes), and a platformer game (115,032 levels and 795,313 votes). As predicted, people preferred levels of intermediate difficulty in all games. Yet, additional factors influencing people's enjoyment also emerged: players preferred levels that matched closely with their prior expectations of difficulty and were also motivated by achievement. We further confirmed these factors in two precisely controlled experiments. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of the dynamics of fun in realistic environments and emphasize the importance of using both realistic, game-like environments and highly controlled experiments to refine theories of human learning and decision-making."

Both are related to conformity to traditional masculinity ideologies (TMI). Qualitative research has highlighted the positive effects of receiving an MDD diagnosis. The diagnosis is often seen as an opportunity for change and provides reassurance that evidence-based treatments for MDD are available. This study aims to investigate how communicating an MDD diagnosis impacts depressed men in terms of male-typical externalizing depression symptoms and beliefs about masculinity norms. Twenty-six Participants were diagnosed with MDD. Pre- to posttest changes were examined in male-typical externalizing depression symptoms (MDRS-22), endorsement of (MRNI-SF) and conformity to TMI (CMNI-30) and gender role conflict (GRC; GRCS-SF). The results were also compared to a sample of 15 healthy men undergoing the same diagnostic procedure but receiving no MDD diagnosis. The posttest, after receipt of the MDD diagnosis, revealed significantly lower male-typical externalizing depression symptoms and GRC scores. However, overall endorsement of and conformity to TMI remained unchanged, suggesting them to be either trait-like constructs or unaffected by the receipt of an MDD diagnosis. Compared to healthy men, the MDD group exhibited higher scores in MDRS-22 and GRCS-SF. Future longitudinal research is needed to explore the time and intervention sensitivity of TMI, along with further investigation into the favorable effects of mental illness diagnoses in men."

There have been, however, a few attempts to capture ongoing changes in experience during meditation. In this study, we integrate and expand upon three of these previous approaches to create a novel instrument, which we called the Lyon Assessment of Meditation Phenomenology (LAMP). This questionnaire encompasses contextual, conative, affective, somatic, attentional, cognitive, and meta-cognitive domains.  Methods: Fifty-three experienced meditators completed it after each meditation session during an intensive 10-day retreat. We modeled the time courses of the individual answers to each question using generalized additive modeling, and automatically clustered participants using group-based trajectory modeling.  Results: Over 60% of the assessed measures exhibited significant change during the retreat across the group, following distinct temporal trajectories. These trajectories reflected differences between meditation types (chiefly, focused attention and open monitoring) and individual expertise, supporting a previously proposed multi-dimensional phenomenological model of mindfulness. We also identified three clusters of individual temporal trajectories associated with prior meditative experience and difficulties experienced during the retreat. Finally, we replicated and extended core findings from mindfulness research on pain regulation.  Conclusions: The proposed multidimensional experience-sampling approach provides a rich characterization of the dynamical aspects of meditative experience and may be usefully employed to deepen our knowledge of the phenomenology and mechanisms of meditation and meditation-based interventions."

A Bayesian analysis,To be fetched,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric condition featuring autonomic nervous system dysfunctions, detectable with abnormal heart rate variability (HRV). This is a promising biomarker, but its dynamics over an acute episode of mania or depression, the two polarities of BD, are poorly understood. Studies of intra- individual HRV changes in BD cannot afford to recruit more than only few dozen patients, as collecting this kind of data is very resource-intensive. This makes the ground treacherous for frequentist statistical analyses. Unlike previous studies, we therefore took a Bayesian approach, as more suitable for quantifying uncertainty in small samples. Specifically, we developed an interpretable probabilistic model of HRV changes over the course of an acute BD episode, using the natural logarithm of the Root Mean Square of Successive RR interval Differences (lnRMSSD) as HRV measure. Patients with BD were recruited at the onset of an acute episode, either mania or depression, and had three-to-four follow-up assessments up to euthymia. Conversely, previous studies used just two assessments, which prevents adequately modelling change. During each assessment, lnRMSSD sleep values were recorded with a wearable device and symptoms’ severity was assessed with clinician-administered questionnaires. A model allowing the lnRMSSD rate of change with respect to symptoms’ improvement to vary across polarities was no better fit than a model disregarding polarities. Strong evidence emerged for a positive lnRMSSD change over the episode’s resolution (probability of positive direction = 95.175%), but sample size limited ascertaining the magnitude of this effect (95% Highest Density Interval of [-0.0366-0.4706] with a Region of Practical Equivalence of [-0.05, 0.05]). In conclusion, improvements in BD symptoms are associated with an increase in lnRMSSD but these changes do not appear to be influenced by the episode polarity."

Wu, Eric Schulz","What factors influence how much fun people have when engaging in inherently enjoyable tasks? The theory of learning progress predicts that people will have the most fun in environments of intermediate difficulty because these environments offer the most progress in learning about the world. Past studies have frequently focused on simple experimental paradigms in which learning was still instrumental for later tasks. Here, we put the theory of fun as learning progress to a test in three large and realistic video game data sets: a puzzle game (with 7,994 levels and 376,341 votes), a racing game (138,662 levels and 614,770 votes), and a platformer game (115,032 levels and 795,313 votes). As predicted, people preferred levels of intermediate difficulty in all games. Yet, additional factors influencing people's enjoyment also emerged: players preferred levels that matched closely with their prior expectations of difficulty and were also motivated by achievement. We further confirmed these factors in two precisely controlled experiments. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of the dynamics of fun in realistic environments and emphasize the importance of using both realistic, game-like environments and highly controlled experiments to refine theories of human learning and decision-making."

Both are related to conformity to traditional masculinity ideologies (TMI). Qualitative research has highlighted the positive effects of receiving an MDD diagnosis. The diagnosis is often seen as an opportunity for change and provides reassurance that evidence-based treatments for MDD are available. This study aims to investigate how communicating an MDD diagnosis impacts depressed men in terms of male-typical externalizing depression symptoms and beliefs about masculinity norms.

In the present investigation we theorize that one way that people may cope with an existential threat is through personal legacy-building efforts. In three correlational studies (N = 855) including samples from the U.S. and Global South, we found that people construe their proenvironmental behaviors as legacy-building activities, and that doing so relates to the perceived effectiveness of a behavior, as well as the reported frequency of engaging in a behavior. Further, we found that people who were motivated to leave a legacy grounded in the desire to have a positive impact on others also tended to be more concerned about climate change, but not paralyzed by such concern, indicated by a negative or non-significant correlation with climate change anxiety, a positive correlation with constructive hope and active coping, and negative correlations with hope based in denial and avoidant coping."

In order to conduct faster, more reproducible, and larger-scale corpus studies on grammaticality in child-caregiver conversations, tools for automatic annotation can offer an effective alternative to tedious manual annotation. We propose a coding scheme for context-dependent grammaticality in child-caregiver conversations and annotate more than 4,000 utterances from a large corpus of transcribed conversations. Based on these annotations, we train and evaluate a range of NLP models. Our results show that fine-tuned Transformer-based models perform best, achieving human inter-annotation agreement levels. As a first application and sanity check of this tool, we use the trained models to annotate a corpus that is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the manually annotated data and verify that children's grammaticality shows a steady increase with age. This work contributes to the growing literature on applying state-of-the-art NLP methods to help study child language acquisition at scale."

The use of chatbots for mental health is now frequently discussed as a means to increase access to mental health resources. For this scoping review of reviews on chatbots for mental health, we performed a systematic search of the literature on Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed and Dimensions.ai and identified 14 relevant reviews published in scientific journals which identified publications following a systematic search on two or more databases. Three additional relevant reviews were included following forward and backward reference examination. The 17 included reviews are: eight systematic reviews (three with meta-analysis), seven scoping reviews and two unlabeled reviews. We have summarized the scope of the reviews as well as their findings. Most reviews included at least one study with 15 participants or less. Few reviews report an important proportion of RCTs and some original publications most of the time report on piloting studies. Overall, the reviews examined the opinions of users of chatbots (generally good user’s perceptions although some find deterrents), the features of chatbots, the outcomes and measures in studies relying on chatbots, the effectiveness of chatbots (particularly the meta-analyses) for the alleviation of mental disorder symptomatology (three meta-analyses find effectiveness for depression, whereas other clinical targets might need further research) as well as their potential for the assessment of mental health. The use of machine learning and natural language processing frameworks (Dialogflow, RASA) seems to drive an increasing number of studies of chatbots for mental health. Overall, we conclude that there is potential for the use of chatbots for mental health, but that progress is necessary in following areas affecting interaction dynamics: reduction of the frequent lack of empathy and repetitiveness, inclusion of user assessment within the chatbot system, inclusion of a memory of past interactions. Large language models might be capable of reducing part of these issues and playing an increasingly important role in the field. Whether data privacy can be guaranteed to users is also an important question, which seems to be overlooked in the field."

Hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and progesterone remain understudied, and it remains unclear how these aspects of puberty contribute uniquely to structural brain development. We used the Human Connectome Project in Development cross-sectional sample of 1,304 youth (aged 5-21 years) to investigate unique contributions of sex, age, pubertal stage, DHEA, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone to cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume development within functionally-relevant networks. Sex and age explain the most unique variance in all three aspects of structure development. Pubertal stage and pubertal hormones uniquely contribute more to cortical surface area, compared to thickness. Among the pubertal hormones, progesterone contributed unique variance to surface area in the default mode network, as well as to thickness in the orbito-affective network. Pubertal mechanisms also contributed unique variance to subcortical volumes. This demonstrates unique relations of understudied pubertal hormones to brain structure development and may help understand risk for psychopathology."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9cwnp,2024-03-19,Assessing Heterogeneous Causal Effects across Clusters in Partially Nested Designs,To be fetched,"Intervention studies in psychology often have a partially nested design (PND): After individuals are assigned to study arms, individuals in a treatment arm are subsequently assigned to clusters (e.g., therapists/therapy-groups) to receive treatment, whereas individuals in a control arm are unclustered. Given the presence of clustering in the treatment arm, it can be of interest to examine heterogeneity of treatment effects across the clusters; but this is challenging in PNDs. First, in defining a causal effect of treatment for a specific cluster, it is unclear how the treatment and control outcomes should be compared, as the clustering is absent in the control arm. Although it may be tempting to compare outcomes between a specific cluster and the entire control arm, this crude comparison may not represent a causal effect even in PNDs with randomized treatment assignments, as the cluster assignment may be nonrandomized (elaborated in this study). In this study, extending the principal stratification and principal score approach, we develop methods to define, identify, and estimate the causal effects of treatment across specific clusters in a PND where the treatment and/or cluster assignment may be nonrandomized. Particularly, we obtain four alternative estimators, including a triply-robust estimator that can provide more robustness to parametric model misspecification. The triply-robust estimator also facilitates using data-adaptive techniques (e.g., machine learning) to assist in the causal effect estimation, and we implement this via the double machine learning procedure. We evaluate the estimators’ performance through simulations, and illustrate the application using an empirical PND example."

Yet, the assessment of personality states usually relies on ad hoc measures whose development and evaluation are largely separated from theoretical considerations. To enable theory-guided development and evaluation of personality state measures, we introduce a framework based on the revised latent state-trait (LST-R) theory. The theory defines latent states as the expectation of an observed measure given a person in a specific situation, which can be decomposed into latent traits and latent situation-specific state residuals. Consequently, items and scales can be evaluated for their reliability due to latent traits (consistency) and situation-specific influences (specificity). We propose that specificity, in particular, is an appealing property for instruments designed to assess personality states. We illustrate this framework with experience sampling data on personality states. Our framework has implications for both the conceptualisation and the assessment of personality states. On the theoretical side, we provide a formal definition of personality states, which enables integration between trait-, process-, and development-focused theories. On the practical side, we show how using LST-R models allows researchers to develop and evaluate state measures on their own terms rather than applying criteria for trait measures to assess the qualities of state measures."

Action control theories such as the Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) framework have been proposed to better understand the translation of intentions into action by incorporating post-intentional processes. However, the explanatory power of the M-PAC framework beyond traditional social cognitive constructs has received limited attention. This study examined the predictive utility of the M-PAC framework for explaining variance in self-reported and device-measured PA behavior among university students. A total of 2,418 undergraduate students (Mean age = 19.1 ± 1.73 [SD] years) completed an online survey that included a self-reported measure of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as well as constructs outlined in the M-PAC framework: instrumental and affective attitudes, perceived capability and opportunity, behavioral regulation, habit and identity. A subsample (n = 376) also wore an ActiGraph wGT3x-BT accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for seven full days to assess MVPA. Robust linear regression models were computed to investigate associations between M-PAC framework constructs and PA behavior. Findings showed the M-PAC framework explained as high as 14.3% and 37.9% of the variance in device-measured and self-reported MVPA, respectively. Regulatory (behavioral regulation), and reflexive (habit and identity) processes were significant predictors of self-reported MVPA when examining the full M-PAC framework, whereas the role identity dimension of PA identity was the only significant predictor of device-assessed MVPA. Taken together, these results reinforce the importance of post-intentional processes, specifically role identity, in understanding PA behavior among university students."

Although many studies have examined false news sharing, there has been no comprehensive, comparative, and computational investigation of the interventions that can reduce this harmful behavior. To do so, we introduce a novel experimental method, the Dynamic Semi-Integrative Approach (DSIA). DSIA involves testing multiple interventions, individual- and item-level moderators, and computational choice modeling (drift–diffusion modeling) in a single framework. By applying DSIA to false news, we find that warning labels and media literacy interventions are particularly effective at increasing news sharing accuracy, followed by a social norm intervention. Accuracy prompts were least effective. Intervention effects were consistent across individual- and item-level characteristics, such as age, analytical thinking, and the political-lean of news items, suggesting wide applicability. The interventions operated via different decision-making processes, suggesting that each intervention engages distinct mental processes to attenuate false news sharing. By developing and applying DSIA, we provide a uniquely detailed insight into false news interventions and establish DSIA as a promising, scalable approach for future experimental research."

CYP who receive protective (child protection plans; CPP) and care interventions (children looked after; CLA) may be particularly vulnerable, with epidemiological work suggesting that nearly half of CLA experience clinical levels of mental health difficulties. Less is known about actual contacts with mental health services.  To address this gap, this study aimed to provide an account of the contacts with mental health services for children with and without CPP and CLA, exploring changes over time and reasons for referral.   Methods: Data were extracted from NHS Digital for all CYP in England in contact with mental health services between April 2016 and March 2021, and included sociodemographic information, CPP or CLA status, and referral reasons. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate associations between relevant exposures (e.g. CPP) and outcomes (e.g. contacts).  Results: We found 1,984,827 CYP in contact with mental health services, with evidence of underrepresentation of some groups (e.g., Asian CYP). The most common referral reasons were anxiety (13%), “in crisis” (10%), depression (7%), neurodevelopmental conditions (excluding autism; 6%), self-harm (6%), and conduct disorder (5%). Contacts tended to increase each year for all groups. We did not find evidence of a particular spike in contact during the COVID-19 pandemic for all CYP. Finally, overall CPP and CLA were between 2-3 times more likely to be in contact with mental health services compared to peers. However, in any given year, this represented between 9-18% of CPP and CLA.  CPP and CLA were at increased risk for being referred for common (e.g., depression, self-harm) and less common problems (e.g. attachment difficulties).    Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that relative to need identified in epidemiological surveys there are wide discrepancies between mental health need and contacts with services. There are also disparities in access affecting CYP from certain groups. In particular, CPP and CLA have particularly high levels of unmet need. Policy makers and service providers need to review their referral and contact data in comparison with epidemiological data and their population context to mitigate inequitable access.

Action control theories such as the Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) framework have been proposed to better understand the translation of intentions into action by incorporating post-intentional processes. However, the explanatory power of the M-PAC framework beyond traditional social cognitive constructs has received limited attention. This study examined the predictive utility of the M-PAC framework for explaining variance in self-reported and device-measured PA behavior among university students. A total of 2,418 undergraduate students (Mean age = 19.1 ± 1.73 [SD] years) completed an online survey that included a self-reported measure of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as well as constructs outlined in the M-PAC framework: instrumental and affective attitudes, perceived capability and opportunity, behavioral regulation, habit and identity. A subsample (n = 376) also wore an ActiGraph wGT3x-BT accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for seven full days to assess MVPA. Robust linear regression models were computed to investigate associations between M-PAC framework constructs and PA behavior. Findings showed the M-PAC framework explained as high as 14.3% and 37.9% of the variance in device-measured and self-reported MVPA, respectively. Regulatory (behavioral regulation), and reflexive (habit and identity) processes were significant predictors of self-reported MVPA when examining the full M-PAC framework, whereas the role identity dimension of PA identity was the only significant predictor of device-assessed MVPA. Taken together, these results reinforce the importance of post-intentional processes, specifically role identity, in understanding PA behavior among university students."

Although many studies have examined false news sharing, there has been no comprehensive, comparative, and computational investigation of the interventions that can reduce this harmful behavior. To do so, we introduce a novel experimental method, the Dynamic Semi-Integrative Approach (DSIA). DSIA involves testing multiple interventions, individual- and item-level moderators, and computational choice modeling (drift–diffusion modeling) in a single framework. By applying DSIA to false news, we find that warning labels and media literacy interventions are particularly effective at increasing news sharing accuracy, followed by a social norm intervention. Accuracy prompts were least effective. Intervention effects were consistent across individual- and item-level characteristics, such as age, analytical thinking, and the political-lean of news items, suggesting wide applicability. The interventions operated via different decision-making processes, suggesting that each intervention engages distinct mental processes to attenuate false news sharing. By developing and applying DSIA, we provide a uniquely detailed insight into false news interventions and establish DSIA as a promising, scalable approach for future experimental research."

CYP who receive protective (child protection plans; CPP) and care interventions (children looked after; CLA) may be particularly vulnerable, with epidemiological work suggesting that nearly half of CLA experience clinical levels of mental health difficulties. Less is known about actual contacts with mental health services.  To address this gap, this study aimed to provide an account of the contacts with mental health services for children with and without CPP and CLA, exploring changes over time and reasons for referral.   Methods: Data were extracted from NHS Digital for all CYP in England in contact with mental health services between April 2016 and March 2021, and included sociodemographic information, CPP or CLA status, and referral reasons. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate associations between relevant exposures (e.g. CPP) and outcomes (e.g. contacts).  Results: We found 1,984,827 CYP in contact with mental health services, with evidence of underrepresentation of some groups (e.g., Asian CYP). The most common referral reasons were anxiety (13%), “in crisis” (10%), depression (7%), neurodevelopmental conditions (excluding autism; 6%), self-harm (6%), and conduct disorder (5%). Contacts tended to increase each year for all groups. We did not find evidence of a particular spike in contact during the COVID-19 pandemic for all CYP. Finally, overall CPP and CLA were between 2-3 times more likely to be in contact with mental health services compared to peers. However, in any given year, this represented between 9-18% of CPP and CLA.  CPP and CLA were at increased risk for being referred for common (e.g., depression, self-harm) and less common problems (e.g. attachment difficulties).    Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that relative to need identified in epidemiological surveys there are wide discrepancies between mental health need and contacts with services. There are also disparities in access affecting CYP from certain groups. In particular, CPP and CLA have particularly high levels of unmet need. Policy makers and service providers need to review their referral and contact data in comparison with epidemiological data and their population context to mitigate inequitable access. While these data indicate escalating demand, service contacts have not increased significantly, suggesting an increased threshold for access in a stretched clinical service."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9cwnp,2024-03-19,Assessing Heterogeneous Causal Effects across Clusters in Partially Nested Designs,Xiao Liu,"Intervention studies in psychology often have a partially nested design (PND): After individuals are assigned to study arms, individuals in a treatment arm are subsequently assigned to clusters (e.g., therapists/therapy-groups) to receive treatment, whereas individuals in a control arm are unclustered. Given the presence of clustering in the treatment arm, it can be of interest to examine heterogeneity of treatment effects across the clusters; but this is challenging in PNDs. First, in defining a causal effect of treatment for a specific cluster, it is unclear how the treatment and control outcomes should be compared, as the clustering is absent in the control arm. Although it may be tempting to compare outcomes between a specific cluster and the entire control arm, this crude comparison may not represent a causal effect even in PNDs with randomized treatment assignments, as the cluster assignment may be nonrandomized (elaborated in this study). In this study, extending the principal stratification and principal score approach, we develop methods to define, identify, and estimate the causal effects of treatment across specific clusters in a PND where the treatment and/or cluster assignment may be nonrandomized. Particularly, we obtain four alternative estimators, including a triply-robust estimator that can provide more robustness to parametric model misspecification. The triply-robust estimator also facilitates using data-adaptive techniques (e.g., machine learning) to assist in the causal effect estimation, and we implement this via the double machine learning procedure. We evaluate the estimators’ performance through simulations, and illustrate the application using an empirical PND example."

Yet, the assessment of personality states usually relies on ad hoc measures whose development and evaluation are largely separated from theoretical considerations. To enable theory-guided development and evaluation of personality state measures, we introduce a framework based on the revised latent state-trait (LST-R) theory. The theory defines latent states as the expectation of an observed measure given a person in a specific situation, which can be decomposed into latent traits and latent situation-specific state residuals. Consequently, items and scales can be evaluated for their reliability due to latent traits (consistency) and situation-specific influences (specificity). We propose that specificity, in particular, is an appealing property for instruments designed to assess personality states. We illustrate this framework with experience sampling data on personality states. Our framework has implications for both the conceptualisation and the assessment of personality states. On the theoretical side, we provide a formal definition of personality states, which enables integration between trait-, process-, and development-focused theories. On the practical side, we show how using LST-R models allows researchers to develop and evaluate state measures on their own terms rather than applying criteria for trait measures to assess the qualities of state measures."

Harms, Adam Omary, Leah Somerville, Deanna Barch","Puberty and associated changes in pubertal hormones influence structural brain development. Hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and progesterone remain understudied, and it remains unclear how these aspects of puberty contribute uniquely to structural brain development. We used the Human Connectome Project in Development cross-sectional sample of 1,304 youth (aged 5-21 years) to investigate unique contributions of sex, age, pubertal stage, DHEA, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone to cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume development within functionally-relevant networks. Sex and age explain the most unique variance in all three aspects of structure development. Pubertal stage and pubertal hormones uniquely contribute more to cortical surface area, compared to thickness. Among the pubertal hormones, progesterone contributed unique variance to surface area in the default mode network, as well as to thickness in the orbito-affective network. Pubertal mechanisms also contributed unique variance to subcortical volumes. This demonstrates unique relations of understudied pubertal hormones to brain structure development and may help understand risk for psychopathology."

Due to the practical implications derived from this research, it is imperative to evaluate how practical recommendations are postulated. To assess the practical relevance of research, effect sizes and its interpretation play a pivotal role. In this study, we examined how the frequently used effect size Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are used and interpreted in eyewitness memory research. Via a systematic literature search, we identified 157 eyewitness memory related articles that conducted ROC curve analyses resulting in 1580 AUC values. Approximately 90% of the studies relied on statistical significance to interpret the AUC values. This practice can be problematic as the sample sizes in many studies were rather large which can lead to statistically significant effects that are trivial. Also, more than half of the studies did not report 95% CIs for their AUC values. Finally, power analyses were frequently not conducted and if they were they were, they were oftentimes not reproducible. To improve the practical inferences of eyewitness memory research, we highlight the need of establishing a smallest effect size of interest, focusing on 95% CIs, and conducting reproducible power analyses."

Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits."

In this study, the objective was to identify which attitude roots are featured in individuals’ self-expressed reasons for negative vaccine attitudes, and explore how these are associated with psychological construct measures of those attitude roots. Our study involved 12 556 participants from the US who wrote texts to explain their negative vaccine attitudes. The texts encompass 2,327 conceptually independent units of anti-vaccination argumentation, each coded for its attitude root(s) by at least two psychological experts. Each participant also completed scale measures of 11 psychological constructs and rated their agreement and familiarity with 11 anti-vaccination arguments, each representing an attitude root. We found that there were four groups of attitude roots whose self-expression was linguistically similar. Logistic regressions showed that a related psychological construct was the strongest, and significant, predictor for expression of three out of the four attitude root groups. In addition, latent class analysis of participants’ coded texts identified three distinct groups of participants that were characterised by their tendency to express combinations of arguments related to (1) fears, (2) anti-scientific conceptions, and (3) politicised perspectives. These findings are discussed in terms of how they can provide cues to vaccine communicators for how best to tailor messaging and responses to individuals motivated by different attitude roots, based on patterns in their self-expression."

We examined how individual differences in visual imagery relate to characteristics of STEM occupations — specifically those requiring computational abilities. In a discovery cohort of 2357 online participants, we found that — consistent with prior research — spatial thinking was positively associated with STEM occupations for both males and females. Object imagery (mnemonic vividness), however, was negatively associated with STEM occupations that require computational thinking, possibly because efficient analytical reasoning abilities associate with low object imagery. This negative association was present for males, but not for females. We extended these findings to a sample of 1891 individuals with aphantasia (congenitally low imagery) and a sample of 186 university undergraduates. These results suggest that the well-known influence of spatial imagery is evident across genders, whereas an independent influence of non-spatial and non-visual abstract analytic abilities on computational STEM professions is confined to males. These findings have implications for policy in fostering careers in STEM, particularly for females."

Using data from a prospective community cohort, this is the first study to investigate the association between a range of perinatal risk factors, hypomanic symptoms, and ‘high-risk’ for BD in the general population.  Methods Parent report of perinatal events were available for 26,040 eighteen-month-olds from the Twins Early Development Study. Subsequent self-report hypomania was measured at ages 16 (Hypomania Checklist-16; N=2,943) and 26 (Mood Disorders Questionnaire; N=7,748). Participants were categorised as ‘high-risk’ for BD using established classifications. Linear and logistic regressions were conducted within a generalised estimating equations framework to account for relatedness in the sample.  Results  Prenatal alcohol exposure (β=0.08, SE=0.04, p=.0002) and number of alcohol units consumed (β=0.09, SE=0.02, p&lt;.0001) were associated with hypomanic symptoms at age 16, and number of alcohol units (OR=1.13, 95% CI:1.06–1.21, p=.0003) and maternal stress (OR=1.68, 95% CI:1.21–2.34, p=.002) were associated with ‘high-risk’ for BD age 16. Prenatal tobacco exposure (β=0.10, SE=0.04, p&lt;.0001) and number of cigarettes smoked (β=0.10, SE=0.01, p&lt;.0001) were associated with hypomanic symptoms and ‘high-risk’ for BD at age 26, although these result were attenuated controlling for parental psychiatric history. Limitations Familial confounding could not be fully adjusted for. Rater reports include some biases. Conclusions These findings show perinatal risk factors to be associated with subclinical hypomania and ‘high-risk’ for BD. Future work should explore the mechanisms underlying these longitudinal associations, which could shed light on prevention and intervention efforts."

The speed of such lexical decisions (LDs) is affected by word frequency. Apart from influencing late, decision-related, processing stages, frequency has also been shown to affect very early stages, and even the processing of non-words. We developed a detailed account of the different frequency effects involved in LDs by 1) dividing LDs into processing stages using a combination of Hidden semi-Markov models and multivariate pattern analysis applied to EEG data and 2) using generalized additive mixed models to investigate how the effect of continuous word and non-word frequency differs between these stages. We discovered six stages. In the earliest stages visual processing was completed faster for frequent words, but took longer for word-like non-words. In later stages, word identification was followed by an elaborate decision process, both affected differently by frequency. We therefore conclude that frequency indeed affects all processes involved in LDs, and that the magnitude and direction of these effects differs both by process and word type."

The WhiCCI uses items informed by the critical consciousness and white anti-racist allyship literature to propose a novel instrument measuring CC in this population.

Parenting programmes in high-income countries can diminish risk for violence, by reducing risk factors such as child aggression and harsh parenting, and increasing protective factors such as child cognitive development and school readiness. However, there is a critical need to identify low-cost programmes with replicable benefits in real-world LMICs contexts. Methods: A three-arm, randomised, single-blind trial evaluated effects of two low-cost group-based parenting programmes recommended for LMICs (ACT: Raising Safe Kids; DBS: dialogic book-sharing) on child aggression (primary outcome), child development, parenting, maltreatment, and stress. Participants were 369 children with medium-high levels of aggression (mean age 3.1 years at baseline) in poor households. Interventions were implemented in city health and education services in southern Brazil. Maternal reports, filmed observations, child tasks, and hair cortisol were assessed at baseline, one-month post intervention, and eight-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses compared each of ACT and DBS with a control group. Results: 368 (99.7%) participants completed follow-up assessments eight-months after the interventions. There was no effect of ACT (standardised mean difference, SMD 0.11, 95%CI -0.05, 0.27) or DBS (SMD 0.05, 95%CI -0.11, 0.21) on the primary outcome of child aggression. ACT reduced harsh parenting behaviour post intervention (SMD -0.23; 95%CI -0.46, -0.01), but not at follow-up. DBS improved book-sharing practices at both time points (e.g., maternal sensitivity at follow-up SMD 0.33; 95%CI: 0.08, 0.57). There were no benefits of either programme for other parenting, child development, or stress outcomes. Conclusion: Two parenting programmes in Brazil had small effects on parenting practices, but did not reduce child aggression or several other important risk/protective factors for violence. Effective early interventions that reduce violence in real-world LMIC settings are highly desirable but may be a challenge to achieve."

Unexpectedly, engagement group did not significantly predict differential change in positive interpretation bias or anxiety. Further, participants who spent less time improved in negative interpretation bias (on one of two measures) significantly more during treatment than those who spent more time. However, participants who spent less time had a significant loss in treatment gains for negative bias (on both measures) by 2-month follow-up. Findings highlight the challenge of interpreting time spent as a marker of engagement and the need to consider cognitive and affective markers of engagement in addition to behavioral markers. Further understanding engagement patterns holds promise for improving DMHIs for anxiety."

Karlsson, Stephan Lewandowsky","People’s opposition to vaccines can be difficult to overcome if their attitudes are motivated by psychological factors such as fears, ideological beliefs, and cognitive patterns, known as “attitude roots”. In this study, the objective was to identify which attitude roots are featured in individuals’ self-expressed reasons for negative vaccine attitudes, and explore how these are associated with psychological construct measures of those attitude roots. Our study involved 12 556 participants from the US who wrote texts to explain their negative vaccine attitudes. The texts encompass 2,327 conceptually independent units of anti-vaccination argumentation, each coded for its attitude root(s) by at least two psychological experts. Each participant also completed scale measures of 11 psychological constructs and rated their agreement and familiarity with 11 anti-vaccination arguments, each representing an attitude root. We found that there were four groups of attitude roots whose self-expression was linguistically similar. Logistic regressions showed that a related psychological construct was the strongest, and significant, predictor for expression of three out of the four attitude root groups. In addition, latent class analysis of participants’ coded texts identified three distinct groups of participants that were characterised by their tendency to express combinations of arguments related to (1) fears, (2) anti-scientific conceptions, and (3) politicised perspectives. These findings are discussed in terms of how they can provide cues to vaccine communicators for how best to tailor messaging and responses to individuals motivated by different attitude roots, based on patterns in their self-expression."

Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits."

Due to the practical implications derived from this research, it is imperative to evaluate how practical recommendations are postulated. To assess the practical relevance of research, effect sizes and its interpretation play a pivotal role. In this study, we examined how the frequently used effect size Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are used and interpreted in eyewitness memory research. Via a systematic literature search, we identified 157 eyewitness memory related articles that conducted ROC curve analyses resulting in 1580 AUC values. Approximately 90% of the studies relied on statistical significance to interpret the AUC values. This practice can be problematic as the sample sizes in many studies were rather large which can lead to statistically significant effects that are trivial. Also, more than half of the studies did not report 95% CIs for their AUC values. Finally, power analyses were frequently not conducted and if they were they were, they were oftentimes not reproducible. To improve the practical inferences of eyewitness memory research, we highlight the need of establishing a smallest effect size of interest, focusing on 95% CIs, and conducting reproducible power analyses."

We examined how individual differences in visual imagery relate to characteristics of STEM occupations — specifically those requiring computational abilities. In a discovery cohort of 2357 online participants, we found that — consistent with prior research — spatial thinking was positively associated with STEM occupations for both males and females. Object imagery (mnemonic vividness), however, was negatively associated with STEM occupations that require computational thinking, possibly because efficient analytical reasoning abilities associate with low object imagery. This negative association was present for males, but not for females. We extended these findings to a sample of 1891 individuals with aphantasia (congenitally low imagery) and a sample of 186 university undergraduates. These results suggest that the well-known influence of spatial imagery is evident across genders, whereas an independent influence of non-spatial and non-visual abstract analytic abilities on computational STEM professions is confined to males. These findings have implications for policy in fostering careers in STEM, particularly for females."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g2ewb,2024-03-19,Low-quality news posts receive higher engagement but not more impressions on Twitter,To be fetched,"One of the most influential findings in misinformation research is the observation that false news spreads farther than similar true news on Twitter. This finding has been widely interpreted as evidence that social media platforms preferentially expose users to misinformation. This work, however, was largely based on claims that were evaluated by fact-checkers - and true claims that were fact-checked are unrepresentative of true claims more broadly. Thus, it is unclear whether prior results will generalize to more representative content. Equally importantly, prior work examined how much content was shared, rather than how many users the content reached. Thus it also remains unclear whether misinformation - even if shared more - actually reaches more users online than accurate information. Here, we address these issues by analyzing over 2 million posts from a random sample of 23,885 Twitter users; as well as a separate sample of all news URLs shared on Twitter over a 9 day period. We find that posts containing links to lower quality news domains do in fact receive significantly more shares and likes than posts containing links to higher quality news domains. In contrast, however, we find no significant difference in the number of users who viewed posts containing links to lower versus higher quality news (and higher quality news receives a much larger amount of total engagement and views across posts). The disconnect between engagement and views may be explained by lower quality links being preferentially shared by users with insular networks and more bot followers."

I suggest that it is more appropriate to view person-levelness (or person-sensitivity) as an ideal we should actively aspire toward, within the constraints placed by other goals such as generalizability and feasibility, when pursuing knowledge about individuals. It is an ideal that we can never hope to perfectly realize—the degree to which it is realized will always be a matter of degree, and there is therefore no clear line of demarcation between the person level and other branches of psychology. This ideal can nonetheless stimulate more person-sensitive conceptualizations, measurements, and analyses."

These measures involve the near-continuous and unobtrusive collection of data from smartphones without requiring active input from participants. For example, GPS sensors are used to determine the (social) context of a person, and accelerometers to measure movement. However, utilizing passive smartphone measures presents methodological challenges during data collection and analysis. Researchers must make multiple decisions when working with such measures, which can result in different conclusions. Unfortunately, the transparency of these decision-making processes is often lacking. The implementation of open science practices is only beginning to emerge in digital phenotyping studies and varies widely across studies. Well-intentioned researchers may fail to report on some decisions due to the variety of choices that must be made. To address this issue and enhance reproducibility in digital phenotyping studies, we propose the adoption of preregistration as a way forward. Although there have been some attempts to preregister digital phenotyping studies, a template for registering such studies is currently missing. This could be problematic due to the high level of complexity that requires a well-structured template. Therefore, our objective was to develop a preregistration template that is easy to use and understandable for researchers. Additionally, we explain this template and provide resources to assist researchers in making informed decisions regarding data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Overall, we aim to make researchers' choices explicit, enhance transparency, and elevate the standards for studies utilizing passive smartphone measures."

This apparent contradiction might be due to differences in task design. Specifically, we hypothesised that a large stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) would allow the participant to engage strategic retrieval and priming mechanisms to facilitate the recognition of a semantically related word, compared to a shorter SOA which promotes more automatic processing. In Experiment 1, 60 participants learned 34 novel words and their meanings which later served as primes for related/unrelated existing word targets in a primed lexical decision task, with a 450ms SOA. There was no significant priming effect. In Experiment 2, we increased the SOA to 1000ms, and found a significant priming effect with novel words. A semantic priming effect with familiar words was found in Experiment 1 but not Experiment 2. We interpret these results as providing evidence for the idea that new and existing words are represented differently, with the former encoded outside of conventional language networks as they appear to rely predominantly on slow (strategic) mechanisms to prime related, existing words."

Understanding is key to solving land use conflicts. It can lead to joint solutions and can thus enable sustainable development at a practical level. It goes beyond environmental consciousness, which is related to general issues, and instead aims to address concrete challenges in the context of sustainable development at an applicable level. ‘Understanding’ with regard to land use conflicts has not yet been defined in the literature. Based on this motivation, it is the aim of this study to create the construct of ‘understanding’ conceptually, to validate it empirically with structural equation modelling, and to demonstrate that understanding might be an important prerequisite for sustainable development. In this case, the focus is not on a general kind of understanding, but rather on specific aspects of understanding in relation to the agriculturally shaped environment in rural areas. The empirical data for the paper were collected by means of a large-scale population survey in Western Pomerania, Germany, a rural peripheral region characterized by typical land-use conflicts in predominantly rural areas. A tripartite division of the construct into cognitive, emotional, and opinion levels was derived theoretically. The data collected showed that this construct is supported empirically and that it can be applied as an SDG indicator. Thus, the refined construct of understanding the agriculturally shaped environment can make a substantial contribution towards closing the knowledge/attitude-behavior gap."

Others, however, seem to handle recurring news negativity better. We theorize that the way people regulate emotional responses to the news could help explain the different patterns of coping with the news. We do this by introducing the emotion regulation literature from psychology in the political communication literature. We investigate if, and to what extent, emotion regulation in response to news use is associated with negative affect, mental wellbeing, and news use frequency. In a preregistered longitudinal intensive diary study in a diverse sample from Western Europe, we find that individuals rely on various emotion regulation strategies to cope with news negativity. We find that people use cognitive reappraisal and selective attention to successfully down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. On the other hand, no effects of the use of distraction or suppression on affect, wellbeing, or news use frequency were found. Thus, the study offers first evidence that some emotion regulation strategies could be one determinant in explaining why people are affected differently by the news. Our study sets the stage for a research agenda in political communication research that studies the role of emotion regulation strategies in understanding differential media effects."

Often, when coordinating with another person, we orient ourselves to face them, as mutual gaze provides valuable cues pertaining to attention and intentions. Moreover, motor synchrony and mutual gaze are associated with prosocial outcomes, yet the perceptual consequences of these forms of coordination remain poorly understood. Across two experiments, we assessed how movement synchrony and gaze direction influence observers’ perceptions of dyads. Observers’ behavioural responses indicated that dyads are perceived as more socially connected and are more enjoyable to watch when moving synchronously and facing each other. Neuroimaging results showed modulation of the Action Observation and Theory of Mind networks by motor synchrony and mutual gaze, with more robust brain activity when evaluating social connectedness than aesthetic value (i.e., enjoyment). A fuller understanding of the consequences of motor synchrony and mutual gaze from the observer’s viewpoint holds important implications for social perception, in terms of how observers intuit social relationships within dyads, and the aesthetic value derived from watching individuals moving in these ways."

Short-term spillover as well as long?term transmission processes suggest that interparental conflict will cause parent-adolescent conflict, and vice versa, as well as that negative mood of parents and adolescents may be one of the transferring mechanisms. This multi-informant daily diary study is among the first to test the day-to-day, and year-to-year cross-lagged effects between interparental conflict and later parent?child conflict at the level of individual families (as compared to between-family studies). Also,  this study investigated the mediating role of negative mood. Data came from 443 Dutch adolescents (M = 13.02, 44.5% girls), and their mothers. A total of 75 daily diaries regarding conflict and negative mood were completed across 15 weeks spread over 5 years. Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were applied to investigate long-term year-to-year  transmission, and Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling was used to investigate short-term day-to-day spillover.

But do people intuitively know what kinds of rituals they should perform to produce distinct socially useful outcomes? It is not obvious that this should be the case. For example, rituals might have acquired their social functions through a winnowing process of cultural group selection or due to top-down control by elites. In this cross-cultural study, we explored intuitions about which rituals would be best suited to resolve a variety of collective action problems. We conducted a cross-cultural, preregistered study, with over 2,700 participants recruited from the US, UK, India, and Japan. Our findings demonstrated a cross-culturally consistent preference for low arousal doctrinal and celebratory procession rituals. We also found scenario specific effects, with confessional rituals preferred in scenarios involving intragroup conflict, and divination rituals featuring more prominently in scenarios that involved environmental uncertainties. Cultural differences were also evident with the US and UK samples showing a pronounced preference for rituals more commonly associated with Christianity, whereas Japan and India displayed less scenario-specific variation but much greater diversity of choice overall. Greater exposure to media portrayals of rituals was also associated with the selection of more sensational rituals, a phenomenon we dub the 'Indiana Jones effect.' Surprisingly, religious upbringing and beliefs only had a limited impact on choices. Our study underscores the balance between cross-culturally recurrent norms and intuitions concerning rituals and more locally or regionally distinctive ideas, contributing to a fuller understanding of how rituals acquire their social functions."

Different components have been proposed as crucial for smooth child-caregiver turn-taking: linguistic, socio-cognitive and motor development, as well as interpersonal adjustment. Slower turn-taking has been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) where these components are often atypical. A recent meta-analysis identifies no reliable changes in turn-taking as children develop, and slower turn-taking in children with ASD. However, several shortcomings in the current literature are highlighted: use of aggregated data, different methods for handling instances of overlapping speech, cross-sectional studies, and insufficient focus on possible confounds. In other words, current evidence on how turn taking abilities develop in children with and without autism is inconclusive. Goals: We aim to empirically evaluate the above meta-analytic findings with more rigorous methods. We extend the state-of-the-art by assessing the relation of individual differences in linguistic, socio-cognitive and motor development in turn-taking. We finally assess the role of interpersonal adjustment on a turn-by-turn basis stratifying by self-adjustment, and how adjustment is moderated by individual differences in development. Methods: We analyzed spontaneous speech in 64 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children diagnosed with ASD and 32 linguistically matched typically developing (TD) children (mean age at recruitment respectively 32.76 and 20.27 months). Multilevel Bayesian ex-Gaussian regressions are used to model response latencies in turn-taking. Analyses of individual differences include Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) as proxy for linguistic skills, Vineland Socialization and Motor Skills. Turn-by-turn conversational dynamics are modeled in terms of concurrent self-adjustment (intrapersonal autocorrelation of latencies) and interpersonal adjustment, within multilevel models. Results: Children with ASD responded faster on average than typically developing ones (116ms, 95%CIs 95-136 vs 307ms, 95%CIs 290-325, evidence ratio for the difference, ER: 24), due to higher speech overlapping (no group difference when overlapping is removed). Both groups decreased latency with development (children with ASD by 78ms, 95%CIs 54-102, every 4 months, TD 47ms, 95%CIs 30-64). Response latency was reliably related to socialization, linguistic and motor skills, which explain variance better than just time from first visit. Children and caregivers displayed positive self- and interpersonal adjustment in both groups (e.g., slower than average turns are followed by slower turns); both effects persisted across 3-5 turns, creating joint “waves” of slower and then faster sequences of turns.  Conclusions: We revise and extend previous meta-analytic findings. Children with ASD respond faster than typically developing ones, due to speech overlaps. Turn-taking abilities develop in relation to individual differences in linguistic, social, and motor skills, but both groups displayed similar self-adjustment and adaptation to others."

Parenting programmes in high-income countries can diminish risk for violence, by reducing risk factors such as child aggression and harsh parenting, and increasing protective factors such as child cognitive development and school readiness. However, there is a critical need to identify low-cost programmes with replicable benefits in real-world LMICs contexts. Methods: A three-arm, randomised, single-blind trial evaluated effects of two low-cost group-based parenting programmes recommended for LMICs (ACT: Raising Safe Kids; DBS: dialogic book-sharing) on child aggression (primary outcome), child development, parenting, maltreatment, and stress. Participants were 369 children with medium-high levels of aggression (mean age 3.1 years at baseline) in poor households. Interventions were implemented in city health and education services in southern Brazil. Maternal reports, filmed observations, child tasks, and hair cortisol were assessed at baseline, one-month post intervention, and eight-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses compared each of ACT and DBS with a control group. Results: 368 (99.7%) participants completed follow-up assessments eight-months after the interventions. There was no effect of ACT (standardised mean difference, SMD 0.11, 95%CI -0.05, 0.27) or DBS (SMD 0.05, 95%CI -0.11, 0.21) on the primary outcome of child aggression. ACT reduced harsh parenting behaviour post intervention (SMD -0.23; 95%CI -0.46, -0.01), but not at follow-up. DBS improved book-sharing practices at both time points (e.g., maternal sensitivity at follow-up SMD 0.33; 95%CI: 0.08, 0.57). There were no benefits of either programme for other parenting, child development, or stress outcomes. Conclusion: Two parenting programmes in Brazil had small effects on parenting practices, but did not reduce child aggression or several other important risk/protective factors for violence. Effective early interventions that reduce violence in real-world LMIC settings are highly desirable but may be a challenge to achieve."

Ces discussions englobent toute une série de sujets, dont notamment l’interdiction des thérapies de conversion à différents niveaux et la visibilité croissante des personnes trans et non binaires dans les médias. Des questions autour de ces thèmes faisaient partie de l’enquête annuelle 2023 du Panel Suisse LGBTIQ+. Dans la cinquième vague du Panel Suisse LGBTIQ+, nous présentons cinq thèmes centraux issus de notre enquête annuelle. Premièrement, nous fournissons un aperçu des caractéristiques des participant·e·x·s à l’enquête, de la répartition démographique et des informations telles que les expériences de discrimination et de coming out. Deuxièmement, nous soulignons les principaux résultats relatifs aux thérapies de conversion. Troisièmement, nous partageons les statistiques sur les crimes de haine signalés, y compris les déclarations à la police et les expériences des victimes. Quatrièmement, nous présentons des statistiques clés concernant les changements de nom et de marqueur de genre dans divers domaines. Enfin, nous fournissons des informations sur la santé et le bien-être des personnes LGBTIQ+. Afin de tenir compte des défis spécifiques (par exemple, la situation juridique, la discrimination) auxquels sont confrontés les différents sous-groupes de la communauté LGBTIQ+, nous avons conçu – comme lors des enquêtes précédentes – différentes versions d’un questionnaire en ligne adaptées aux minorités sexuelles (par exemple, les personnes gaies, lesbiennes, bisexuelles ou pansexuelles) et aux minorités de genre (par exemple, les personnes trans ou intersexes). Les personnes cis-hétérosexuelles intéressées ont également été invitées à participer à l’enquête. Veuillez noter qu’une personne peut être à la fois membre d’une minorité sexuelle et d’une minorité de genre. Afin de réduire le temps passé à répondre à l’enquête, les participant·e·x·s n’ont rempli qu’une seule version du questionnaire. Toutes les versions ont été traduites en anglais, allemand, français et italien. Grâce à l’aide de nombreuses organisations LGBTIQ+, de magazines et de personnes qui ont largement partagé notre étude via différents médias, 2’812 personnes ont répondu à notre questionnaire de janvier 2023 à septembre 2023.

This apparent contradiction might be due to differences in task design. Specifically, we hypothesised that a large stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) would allow the participant to engage strategic retrieval and priming mechanisms to facilitate the recognition of a semantically related word, compared to a shorter SOA which promotes more automatic processing. In Experiment 1, 60 participants learned 34 novel words and their meanings which later served as primes for related/unrelated existing word targets in a primed lexical decision task, with a 450ms SOA. There was no significant priming effect. In Experiment 2, we increased the SOA to 1000ms, and found a significant priming effect with novel words. A semantic priming effect with familiar words was found in Experiment 1 but not Experiment 2. We interpret these results as providing evidence for the idea that new and existing words are represented differently, with the former encoded outside of conventional language networks as they appear to rely predominantly on slow (strategic) mechanisms to prime related, existing words."

But do people intuitively know what kinds of rituals they should perform to produce distinct socially useful outcomes? It is not obvious that this should be the case. For example, rituals might have acquired their social functions through a winnowing process of cultural group selection or due to top-down control by elites. In this cross-cultural study, we explored intuitions about which rituals would be best suited to resolve a variety of collective action problems. We conducted a cross-cultural, preregistered study, with over 2,700 participants recruited from the US, UK, India, and Japan. Our findings demonstrated a cross-culturally consistent preference for low arousal doctrinal and celebratory procession rituals. We also found scenario specific effects, with confessional rituals preferred in scenarios involving intragroup conflict, and divination rituals featuring more prominently in scenarios that involved environmental uncertainties. Cultural differences were also evident with the US and UK samples showing a pronounced preference for rituals more commonly associated with Christianity, whereas Japan and India displayed less scenario-specific variation but much greater diversity of choice overall. Greater exposure to media portrayals of rituals was also associated with the selection of more sensational rituals, a phenomenon we dub the 'Indiana Jones effect.' Surprisingly, religious upbringing and beliefs only had a limited impact on choices. Our study underscores the balance between cross-culturally recurrent norms and intuitions concerning rituals and more locally or regionally distinctive ideas, contributing to a fuller understanding of how rituals acquire their social functions."

Different components have been proposed as crucial for smooth child-caregiver turn-taking: linguistic, socio-cognitive and motor development, as well as interpersonal adjustment. Slower turn-taking has been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) where these components are often atypical. A recent meta-analysis identifies no reliable changes in turn-taking as children develop, and slower turn-taking in children with ASD. However, several shortcomings in the current literature are highlighted: use of aggregated data, different methods for handling instances of overlapping speech, cross-sectional studies, and insufficient focus on possible confounds. In other words, current evidence on how turn taking abilities develop in children with and without autism is inconclusive. Goals: We aim to empirically evaluate the above meta-analytic findings with more rigorous methods. We extend the state-of-the-art by assessing the relation of individual differences in linguistic, socio-cognitive and motor development in turn-taking.

Cross, Kohinoor Monish Darda, Ryssa Moffat, Lina Maria Muñoz Perez, Stacey Humphries, Louise P Kirsch","As social beings, we are adept at coordinating bodily movements and gaze with others. Often, when coordinating with another person, we orient ourselves to face them, as mutual gaze provides valuable cues pertaining to attention and intentions. Moreover, motor synchrony and mutual gaze are associated with prosocial outcomes, yet the perceptual consequences of these forms of coordination remain poorly understood. Across two experiments, we assessed how movement synchrony and gaze direction influence observers’ perceptions of dyads. Observers’ behavioural responses indicated that dyads are perceived as more socially connected and are more enjoyable to watch when moving synchronously and facing each other. Neuroimaging results showed modulation of the Action Observation and Theory of Mind networks by motor synchrony and mutual gaze, with more robust brain activity when evaluating social connectedness than aesthetic value (i.e., enjoyment). A fuller understanding of the consequences of motor synchrony and mutual gaze from the observer’s viewpoint holds important implications for social perception, in terms of how observers intuit social relationships within dyads, and the aesthetic value derived from watching individuals moving in these ways."

Understanding is key to solving land use conflicts. It can lead to joint solutions and can thus enable sustainable development at a practical level. It goes beyond environmental consciousness, which is related to general issues, and instead aims to address concrete challenges in the context of sustainable development at an applicable level. ‘Understanding’ with regard to land use conflicts has not yet been defined in the literature. Based on this motivation, it is the aim of this study to create the construct of ‘understanding’ conceptually, to validate it empirically with structural equation modelling, and to demonstrate that understanding might be an important prerequisite for sustainable development. In this case, the focus is not on a general kind of understanding, but rather on specific aspects of understanding in relation to the agriculturally shaped environment in rural areas. The empirical data for the paper were collected by means of a large-scale population survey in Western Pomerania, Germany, a rural peripheral region characterized by typical land-use conflicts in predominantly rural areas. A tripartite division of the construct into cognitive, emotional, and opinion levels was derived theoretically. The data collected showed that this construct is supported empirically and that it can be applied as an SDG indicator. Thus, the refined construct of understanding the agriculturally shaped environment can make a substantial contribution towards closing the knowledge/attitude-behavior gap."

Bakker","Daily negativity in the news can cause people to experience negative affect, negatively affects mental wellbeing, and, in response, people (temporarily) avoid the news. Others, however, seem to handle recurring news negativity better. We theorize that the way people regulate emotional responses to the news could help explain the different patterns of coping with the news. We do this by introducing the emotion regulation literature from psychology in the political communication literature. We investigate if, and to what extent, emotion regulation in response to news use is associated with negative affect, mental wellbeing, and news use frequency. In a preregistered longitudinal intensive diary study in a diverse sample from Western Europe, we find that individuals rely on various emotion regulation strategies to cope with news negativity. We find that people use cognitive reappraisal and selective attention to successfully down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. On the other hand, no effects of the use of distraction or suppression on affect, wellbeing, or news use frequency were found. Thus, the study offers first evidence that some emotion regulation strategies could be one determinant in explaining why people are affected differently by the news. Our study sets the stage for a research agenda in political communication research that studies the role of emotion regulation strategies in understanding differential media effects."

Short-term spillover as well as long?term transmission processes suggest that interparental conflict will cause parent-adolescent conflict, and vice versa, as well as that negative mood of parents and adolescents may be one of the transferring mechanisms. This multi-informant daily diary study is among the first to test the day-to-day, and year-to-year cross-lagged effects between interparental conflict and later parent?child conflict at the level of individual families (as compared to between-family studies). Also,  this study investigated the mediating role of negative mood. Data came from 443 Dutch adolescents (M = 13.02, 44.5% girls), and their mothers. A total of 75 daily diaries regarding conflict and negative mood were completed across 15 weeks spread over 5 years. Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were applied to investigate long-term year-to-year  transmission, and Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling was used to investigate short-term day-to-day spillover. Overall, we found neither short-term spillover, nor long-term transmission, as the reciprocal cross-lagged effects between interparental conflict and adolescent-mother  conflict were non-significant. Even though we found direct and reciprocal cross-lagged effects between negative mood and both interparental and adolescent-mother conflict on both the day?to-day, and year-to-year timescales, both the direct and the indirect effects between interparental  and adolescent-mother conflict were non-significant."

I suggest that it is more appropriate to view person-levelness (or person-sensitivity) as an ideal we should actively aspire toward, within the constraints placed by other goals such as generalizability and feasibility, when pursuing knowledge about individuals. It is an ideal that we can never hope to perfectly realize—the degree to which it is realized will always be a matter of degree, and there is therefore no clear line of demarcation between the person level and other branches of psychology. This ideal can nonetheless stimulate more person-sensitive conceptualizations, measurements, and analyses."

This finding has been widely interpreted as evidence that social media platforms preferentially expose users to misinformation. This work, however, was largely based on claims that were evaluated by fact-checkers - and true claims that were fact-checked are unrepresentative of true claims more broadly. Thus, it is unclear whether prior results will generalize to more representative content. Equally importantly, prior work examined how much content was shared, rather than how many users the content reached. Thus it also remains unclear whether misinformation - even if shared more - actually reaches more users online than accurate information. Here, we address these issues by analyzing over 2 million posts from a random sample of 23,885 Twitter users; as well as a separate sample of all news URLs shared on Twitter over a 9 day period. We find that posts containing links to lower quality news domains do in fact receive significantly more shares and likes than posts containing links to higher quality news domains. In contrast, however, we find no significant difference in the number of users who viewed posts containing links to lower versus higher quality news (and higher quality news receives a much larger amount of total engagement and views across posts). The disconnect between engagement and views may be explained by lower quality links being preferentially shared by users with insular networks and more bot followers."

Siepe, Mahmoud Elsherif, Koen Niemeijer, Pia K. Andresen, Samir Akre, Laura Bringmann, Zachary Daniel Cohen, Nathaniel R Choukas, Konstantin Drexl","Passive smartphone measures hold significant potential and are increasingly employed in psychological and biomedical research to capture an individual's behavior. These measures involve the near-continuous and unobtrusive collection of data from smartphones without requiring active input from participants. For example, GPS sensors are used to determine the (social) context of a person, and accelerometers to measure movement. However, utilizing passive smartphone measures presents methodological challenges during data collection and analysis. Researchers must make multiple decisions when working with such measures, which can result in different conclusions. Unfortunately, the transparency of these decision-making processes is often lacking. The implementation of open science practices is only beginning to emerge in digital phenotyping studies and varies widely across studies. Well-intentioned researchers may fail to report on some decisions due to the variety of choices that must be made. To address this issue and enhance reproducibility in digital phenotyping studies, we propose the adoption of preregistration as a way forward. Although there have been some attempts to preregister digital phenotyping studies, a template for registering such studies is currently missing. This could be problematic due to the high level of complexity that requires a well-structured template. Therefore, our objective was to develop a preregistration template that is easy to use and understandable for researchers. Additionally, we explain this template and provide resources to assist researchers in making informed decisions regarding data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Overall, we aim to make researchers' choices explicit, enhance transparency, and elevate the standards for studies utilizing passive smartphone measures."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vbs6d,2024-03-18,How to objectively quantify a subjective phenomenon: The case of Flashed Face Distortion Effect,To be fetched,"Objectively quantifying subjective phenomena like visual illusions is challenging. We address this issue in the context of the Flashed Face Distortion Effect (FFDE), where faces presented in succession appear distorted and grotesque. We first show that the traditional method of quantifying FFDE – via subjective ratings of the level of distortion – is subject to substantial biases. Motivated by this finding, we develop an objective method for quantifying FFDE by introducing two design innovations. First, we create artificially distorted faces and ask observers to discriminate between undistorted and objectively distorted faces. Second, we employ both an illusion condition, which includes a succession of 15 face flashes, and a control condition, which includes a single face flash and does not induce an illusion. Using these innovations, we quantify the strength of the FFDE illusion by comparing the response bias for identifying distorted faces between the illusion and control conditions. We find that our method successfully quantifies the face distortion, with observers exhibiting a more liberal response bias in the illusion condition. Finally, we apply our new method to evaluate how the FFDE illusion is modulated by face eccentricity, face inversion, the temporal frequency of the face flashes, and presence of temporal gaps between consecutive faces. Our results demonstrate the utility of our objective method in quantifying the subjective illusion of face distortion. Critically, the method is general and can be applied to other phenomena that are inherently subjective."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/32xyz,2024-03-18,Exploring undiscovered public knowledge in neuroscience,To be fetched,"In this essay, I argue that a combination of research synthesis and philosophical methods can fill an important methodological gap in neuroscience. While experimental research and formal modeling have seen their methods progressively increase in rigor and sophistication over the years, the task of analyzing and synthesizing the vast literature reporting new results and models has lagged behind. The problem is aggravated because neuroscience has grown and expanded into a vast mosaic of related but partially independent subfields, each with their own literatures. This fragmentation not only makes it difficult to see the full picture emerging from neuroscience research, but also limits progress in individual subfields. The current neuroscience literature has the perfect conditions to create what the information scientist Don Swanson called “undiscovered public knowledge” – knowledge that exists in the mutual implications of different published pieces of information but that is nonetheless undiscovered because those pieces have not been explicitly connected. Current methods for rigorous research synthesis, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses, mostly focus on combining similar studies and are not suited for exploring undiscovered public knowledge. To that aim, they need to be adapted and supplemented. I argue that successful exploration of the hidden implications in the neuroscience literature will require the combination of these adapted research synthesis methods with philosophical methods for rigorous (and creative) analysis and synthesis."

Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of motion on attentional capture in spider-fearful and non-fearful participants by using point-light stimuli and naturalistic videos. Point-light stimuli consist of moving dots representing joints and thereby visualizing biological motion (e.g. of a walking human or cat) without needing a visible body. Spider-fearful (n = 30) and non-spider-fearful (n = 31) participants completed a visual search task with moving targets (point-light/naturalistic videos) and static distractors (images), static targets and moving distractors, or static targets and static distractors. Participants searched for a specified animal type (snakes, spiders, cats, or doves) as quickly as possible. We replicated previous findings with static stimuli: snakes were detected faster and increased distraction, while spiders just increased distraction. However, contrary to our hypotheses, spider targets did not speed up responses, neither in the group of control nor in the group of spider-fearful participants. Interestingly, stimuli-specific effects were toned down, abolished, or even changed direction when motion was introduced. Also, we demonstrated that point-light stimuli were of similar efficiency as naturalistic videos, indicating that for testing effects of motion in visual search, “pure” motion stimuli might be sufficient. As we do show a substantial modulation of visual search phenomena by biological motion, we advocate for future studies to use moving stimuli, equivalent to our dynamic environment, to increase ecological validity."

The ENIGMA working groups tackle the growing challenge of data harmonization and standardization in analytic workflows, and address the need for well-powered, multi-center studies by providing a community-driven structure and platform for collaborations. The recently-formed ENIGMA Neuromodulation Working Group (ENIGMA-NeMo) includes subgroups representing individual neuromodulation modalities, supported by a machine learning/artificial intelligence core providing advanced analytic techniques within and across modulation modalities. The goals of this working group include: suggesting standards and standardizations for research in neuromodulation [e.g., neuromodulation extension of Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)]; improving reproducibility of neuromodulation research findings; developing models for predicting and improving brain circuit engagement, safety, and clinical efficacy outcomes across modulation modalities; accelerating development of therapeutic parameters for clinical neuromodulation across disease populations; and evaluating existing neuromodulation methods and advancing these techniques to maximize individual treatment effects towards precision medicine. The ENIGMA-NeMo group applies standardized analytic pipelines for large-scale as well as single-patient analyses of multi-modal brain MRI, neuromodulation parameters and outcome data (e.g., neuropsychological, psychophysiological). Here, we discuss initial goals, challenges, and strategies for overcoming these challenges and gaps in the literature.

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/arvkq,2024-03-18,Target-distractor similarity predicts visual search efficiency but only for highly similar features,To be fetched,"A major constraining factor for attentional selection is the similarity between targets and distractors. When similarity is low, target items can be identified quickly and efficiently, while high similarity can incur large costs on processing speed. Models of visual search contrast a fast, efficient parallel stage with a slow serial processing stage where search times are strongly modulated by the number of distractors in the display. In particular, recent work has argued that the magnitude of search slopes should be inversely proportional to target-distractor similarity. Here, we assessed the relationship between target-distractor similarity and search slopes. In our visual search tasks, participants detected an oddball color target among distractors (Experiments 1 &amp; 2) or discriminated the direction of a triangle in the oddball color (Experiment 3). We systematically varied the similarity between target and distractor colors (along a circular CIELab color wheel) and the number of distractors in the search array, finding logarithmic search slopes that were inversely proportional to the number of items in the array. Surprisingly, we also found that searches were highly efficient (i.e., near zero slopes) for targets and distractors that were extremely similar (≤20° in color space). These findings indicate that visual search is systematically influenced by target-distractor similarity across different processing stages. Importantly, we found that search can be highly efficient and entirely unaffected by the number of distractors despite high perceptual similarity, in contrast to the general assumption that high similarity must lead to slow and serial search behavior."

Across the cognitive sciences, including psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and neuroscience, scholars have puzzled over the origins and structure of our understanding of the physical world on the one hand, and the psychological world on the other. Each of these research areas has accumulated evidence that these two domains of thought are distinct and modular. We disagree. Starting in infancy, and indeed throughout our lives, our psychological reasoning (naive psychology) depends on inputs from physical reasoning (naive physics). In this paper, we first review evidence for the modularity hypothesis from developmental psychology, cross-cultural research, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology, and argue that this work provides evidence for domain-specificity (that naive psychology and physics are conceptually distinct) but not for modularity (that these two abilities are informationally encapsulated). To the contrary, we use evidence from each of these disciplines, and research from computational cognitive science, to argue that naive psychology and physics constitute parallel and integrated systems in human minds and brains. We end by laying out a research program to investigate this integration."

Small and subtle piloerection events were by far the most frequent and the large, obvious events were the least frequent. On average, we found the duration of piloerection to be 10.09 seconds, with more intense episodes lasting longer. An incidental yet pivotal aspect of our research was the independent validation of the Gooselab software, which our data suggests fails to reliably detect even the most pronounced piloerection events. By thoroughly describing the piloerection process, our research fills a critical gap necessary for accurate measurement and assessment of this physiological response. The study emphasizes the superiority of manual analysis for capturing the full scope of piloerection characteristics, a method we advocate for its precision, reliability, and potential for generating insightful data. This data not only challenges the current automated analytical techniques but also enhances the scientific understanding of understudied physiological responses in humans."

LGBTQ-affirmative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targets psychosocial pathways through which minority stress contributes to these disparities. We evaluated whether LGBTQ-affirmative CBT operates through these mechanisms. Methods: We analyzed clinical trial data from 254 HIV-negative YGBM (ages 18–35; 67.2% racial/ethnic minority) with mental, behavioral, and/or sexual health concerns, randomly assigned to receive LGBTQ-affirmative CBT or one of two control conditions: LGBTQ-affirmative community counseling or HIV testing and counseling. Using baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-up assessments, trajectories of identity-specific (i.e., acceptance concerns, concealment motivation, and internalized stigma) and general (i.e., assertiveness, emotion regulation difficulties, rumination, self-esteem, and social support) psychological mechanisms were examined. Additionally, latent change score structural equation models tested whether these mechanisms mediated the relative impact of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT on depression, anxiety, substance use, HIV-transmission-risk behavior, or their co-occurrence. Results: LGBTQ-affirmative CBT was associated with early and enduring improvements in internalized stigma, emotion regulation, rumination, and assertiveness, but not greater than control. Changes in emotion regulation and assertiveness also consistently predicted reductions in all study outcomes. No indirect effects emerged in the mediation models. Conclusion: Identifying treatment mechanisms can maximize the efficacy of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT. Based on this study, universal processes such as assertiveness and emotion regulation difficulties may be promising candidate mechanisms. Future iterations of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT should aim to maximize improvements in these processes."

Currently, recurrences are often identified too late, while existing preventive strategies may not sufficiently address ethio-patho-physiological mechanisms for recurrence. Negative memory bias (the tendency to better remember negative than positive events), negative attention bias (selective attention favoring mood-congruent information), and cognitive control deficits are important factors involved in the onset, maintenance, and recurrence of depressive episodes.   Methods: Here we describe the protocol for the Smartphone-based Monitoring and cognition Modification Against Recurrence of Depression (SMARD) study, aiming to investigate different forms of cognitive training programs administered via smartphones, in order to develop a second-generation recurrence prevention program. In addition, we will gather Experience Sampling Method (ESM) assessments during a 6-day period, and during the follow-up period we will obtain behavioral data on (social) activities with BEHAPP, a smartphone-based Mobile Passive Monitoring application for remote behavioral monitoring to identify behavioral changes indicative of an imminent depressive episode.  Results: In a randomized controlled trial, SMARD will compare the effects of a smartphone-based Memory Bias Modification Training (MBT), Cognitive Control Training (CCT), and Attention Bias Modification Training (ABT) versus cognitive domain-specific (active-) sham trainings in 120 remitted MDD-patients with recurrent-MDD. Over the course of three weeks, participants receive multiple daily training sessions. Thereafter, participants will be followed up for 1.5 years with 3-monthly interviews to assess recurrences.   Conclusion: The SMARD study aims to 1. assess the effects of the cognitive training programs versus their training-specific (active-) sham conditions on changes in memory, cognitive control dysfunction and attention; 2. relate training effects to neural networks previously identified in (recurrence of) MDD (therefore we obtain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ((f)MRI) scans before and after the training in a subset of participants); 3. link baseline and change in memory, cognitive control, attention and neural functioning, and ESM data to prospective recurrences; 4. examine whether passive smartphone-use monitoring can be used for prediction of recurrences."

Störmer","A major constraining factor for attentional selection is the similarity between targets and distractors. When similarity is low, target items can be identified quickly and efficiently, while high similarity can incur large costs on processing speed. Models of visual search contrast a fast, efficient parallel stage with a slow serial processing stage where search times are strongly modulated by the number of distractors in the display. In particular, recent work has argued that the magnitude of search slopes should be inversely proportional to target-distractor similarity. Here, we assessed the relationship between target-distractor similarity and search slopes. In our visual search tasks, participants detected an oddball color target among distractors (Experiments 1 &amp; 2) or discriminated the direction of a triangle in the oddball color (Experiment 3). We systematically varied the similarity between target and distractor colors (along a circular CIELab color wheel) and the number of distractors in the search array, finding logarithmic search slopes that were inversely proportional to the number of items in the array. Surprisingly, we also found that searches were highly efficient (i.e., near zero slopes) for targets and distractors that were extremely similar (≤20° in color space). These findings indicate that visual search is systematically influenced by target-distractor similarity across different processing stages. Importantly, we found that search can be highly efficient and entirely unaffected by the number of distractors despite high perceptual similarity, in contrast to the general assumption that high similarity must lead to slow and serial search behavior."

Across the cognitive sciences, including psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and neuroscience, scholars have puzzled over the origins and structure of our understanding of the physical world on the one hand, and the psychological world on the other. Each of these research areas has accumulated evidence that these two domains of thought are distinct and modular. We disagree. Starting in infancy, and indeed throughout our lives, our psychological reasoning (naive psychology) depends on inputs from physical reasoning (naive physics). In this paper, we first review evidence for the modularity hypothesis from developmental psychology, cross-cultural research, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology, and argue that this work provides evidence for domain-specificity (that naive psychology and physics are conceptually distinct) but not for modularity (that these two abilities are informationally encapsulated). To the contrary, we use evidence from each of these disciplines, and research from computational cognitive science, to argue that naive psychology and physics constitute parallel and integrated systems in human minds and brains. We end by laying out a research program to investigate this integration."

The ENIGMA working groups tackle the growing challenge of data harmonization and standardization in analytic workflows, and address the need for well-powered, multi-center studies by providing a community-driven structure and platform for collaborations. The recently-formed ENIGMA Neuromodulation Working Group (ENIGMA-NeMo) includes subgroups representing individual neuromodulation modalities, supported by a machine learning/artificial intelligence core providing advanced analytic techniques within and across modulation modalities. The goals of this working group include: suggesting standards and standardizations for research in neuromodulation [e.g., neuromodulation extension of Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)]; improving reproducibility of neuromodulation research findings; developing models for predicting and improving brain circuit engagement, safety, and clinical efficacy outcomes across modulation modalities; accelerating development of therapeutic parameters for clinical neuromodulation across disease populations; and evaluating existing neuromodulation methods and advancing these techniques to maximize individual treatment effects towards precision medicine. The ENIGMA-NeMo group applies standardized analytic pipelines for large-scale as well as single-patient analyses of multi-modal brain MRI, neuromodulation parameters and outcome data (e.g., neuropsychological, psychophysiological). Here, we discuss initial goals, challenges, and strategies for overcoming these challenges and gaps in the literature.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of motion on attentional capture in spider-fearful and non-fearful participants by using point-light stimuli and naturalistic videos. Point-light stimuli consist of moving dots representing joints and thereby visualizing biological motion (e.g. of a walking human or cat) without needing a visible body. Spider-fearful (n = 30) and non-spider-fearful (n = 31) participants completed a visual search task with moving targets (point-light/naturalistic videos) and static distractors (images), static targets and moving distractors, or static targets and static distractors. Participants searched for a specified animal type (snakes, spiders, cats, or doves) as quickly as possible. We replicated previous findings with static stimuli: snakes were detected faster and increased distraction, while spiders just increased distraction. However, contrary to our hypotheses, spider targets did not speed up responses, neither in the group of control nor in the group of spider-fearful participants. Interestingly, stimuli-specific effects were toned down, abolished, or even changed direction when motion was introduced. Also, we demonstrated that point-light stimuli were of similar efficiency as naturalistic videos, indicating that for testing effects of motion in visual search, “pure” motion stimuli might be sufficient. As we do show a substantial modulation of visual search phenomena by biological motion, we advocate for future studies to use moving stimuli, equivalent to our dynamic environment, to increase ecological validity."

França,"In this essay, I argue that a combination of research synthesis and philosophical methods can fill an important methodological gap in neuroscience. While experimental research and formal modeling have seen their methods progressively increase in rigor and sophistication over the years, the task of analyzing and synthesizing the vast literature reporting new results and models has lagged behind. The problem is aggravated because neuroscience has grown and expanded into a vast mosaic of related but partially independent subfields, each with their own literatures. This fragmentation not only makes it difficult to see the full picture emerging from neuroscience research, but also limits progress in individual subfields. The current neuroscience literature has the perfect conditions to create what the information scientist Don Swanson called “undiscovered public knowledge” – knowledge that exists in the mutual implications of different published pieces of information but that is nonetheless undiscovered because those pieces have not been explicitly connected. Current methods for rigorous research synthesis, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses, mostly focus on combining similar studies and are not suited for exploring undiscovered public knowledge. To that aim, they need to be adapted and supplemented. I argue that successful exploration of the hidden implications in the neuroscience literature will require the combination of these adapted research synthesis methods with philosophical methods for rigorous (and creative) analysis and synthesis."

We address this issue in the context of the Flashed Face Distortion Effect (FFDE), where faces presented in succession appear distorted and grotesque. We first show that the traditional method of quantifying FFDE – via subjective ratings of the level of distortion – is subject to substantial biases. Motivated by this finding, we develop an objective method for quantifying FFDE by introducing two design innovations. First, we create artificially distorted faces and ask observers to discriminate between undistorted and objectively distorted faces. Second, we employ both an illusion condition, which includes a succession of 15 face flashes, and a control condition, which includes a single face flash and does not induce an illusion. Using these innovations, we quantify the strength of the FFDE illusion by comparing the response bias for identifying distorted faces between the illusion and control conditions. We find that our method successfully quantifies the face distortion, with observers exhibiting a more liberal response bias in the illusion condition. Finally, we apply our new method to evaluate how the FFDE illusion is modulated by face eccentricity, face inversion, the temporal frequency of the face flashes, and presence of temporal gaps between consecutive faces. Our results demonstrate the utility of our objective method in quantifying the subjective illusion of face distortion. Critically, the method is general and can be applied to other phenomena that are inherently subjective."

Methods: The program's effectiveness was measured using a pre, and post-intervention design, with follow-up assessments (2 months later) to track the sustainability of outcomes, with a sample of 33 youth workers. The program consisted of an 8-day immersive training focused on self-compassion, mindfulness, and nature connection. Self-compassion was measured using the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) at baseline, immediately after the program (post-test), and two months later (follow-up).  Results: Statistically significant increases in self-compassion scores were observed both immediately after the program (19.81%) and at follow-up (25.24%) compared to baseline. The intervention led to significant increases in positive self-compassion constructs (self-kindness, mindfulness, common humanity) and decreases in negative constructs such as self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification. Notably, improvements persisted and even strengthened at follow-up, indicating the long-lasting impact of the program. Additionally, the study found no significant differences in outcomes based on demographic variables, suggesting the program's broad applicability. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the Natural Compassion program is successful in fostering self-compassion thus enhancing well-being among youth workers. The group delivery format of the intervention, which emphasized shared experiences in nature, may have contributed to a diminished sense of isolation and an enhanced sense of common humanity. Results point to the potential of integrating such interventions into youth work training and practice, with implications for policy and future research focused on community and mutual support mechanisms within emotionally demanding professions Further research with larger samples and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these initial findings and explore potential mechanisms of change."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g4pr2,2024-03-18,What different network models reveal about the relation of engagement to burnout,To be fetched,"Schoolwork Engagement and school burnout are both multi-facetted constructs consisting of multiple components, including emotional, affective and behavioral facets for engagement and exhaustion, cynicism and inadequacy for burnout. Although the desirable engagement and the undesirable burnout symptoms are negatively correlated, there are some individuals who report high levels of both engagement and burnout. Within-person analyses are needed to detect such engaged but burned out individuals, who are otherwise overlooked if common between-person correlations are examined. This study extends prior comparison of insights to be gained from between- versus within-person analyses. Based on the critique that multi-facetted constructs may be better represented in psychometric networks than latent factor measurement models (see Lange et al., 2020), we examined the relationships among and between the specific engagement and burnout facets with psychometric and residual network models and compared their insights to the common latent factor (CFA) approach. To account for the problem that within-person co-endorsements of engagement and burnout experiences may be overlooked with between-person correlations, we then compared the inter-individual correlation-based psychometric and residual networks to an intra-individual co-endorsement network. The present study shows how motivational research may benefit from utilizing and contrasting psychometric network models as they may help to examining specific facets of constructs and that the inferences and conclusions that are drawn might change in contrast to the use of conventional latent factor approaches."

A large representative sample of Slovak participants (N = 1233) filled in several measures of environmental value orientation, perceived psychological barriers and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. The parallel mediation models revealed that environmental value orientation predicts engagement in pro-environmental behaviour, and this relationship is partially mediated by certain psychological barriers, yet the role of the specific barriers varied substantially with different types of behaviour. Overall, however, the explained variance in pro-environmental behaviour was relatively modest (up to 31%), suggesting the presence of other important social, psychological, and structural variables as predictors in this regard. Our findings emphasize the intricate role of psychological barriers and demographic factors in shaping environmental actions. Understanding these complexities can help design targeted interventions to bridge the 'green gap' effectively."

A number of influential theories make predictions about how and why neurodevelopmental alterations may mediate or moderate the effects of the social environment on the emergence of mental illness. Here, we discuss current evidence supporting each of these theories. Although this area of research is rapidly growing, the body of evidence is still relatively limited. However, there exist some consistent findings, including increased striatal reactivity during positive affective processing and larger hippocampal volumes being associated with increased vulnerability or susceptibility to the effects of social environments on internalizing symptoms. Limited longitudinal work has investigated neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking the social environment with mental health. Drawing from human research and insights from animal studies, we propose an integrated mediation-moderation model and outline future research directions to advance the field."

The aim of the present study was to to capture the dynamics of positive ER processes in daily life by investigating (1) which positive ER strategies individuals use in their daily lives, (2) whether the intensity of positive and negative emotions is associated with the use of specific positive ER strategies, and (3) whether the use of specific positive ER strategies is associated with changes in positive and negative emotions. Secondly, we aimed to examine the role of anhedonia in explaining inter-individual differences in positive ER processes. A total of N = 159 emerging adults (Mage = 21.50, 76% female) completed a baseline questionnaire and enrolled in a 14-day Experience Sampling Method (ESM) study (5x/day), in which we measured positive and negative emotions, and positive ER strategy use. Results from pre-registered Dynamic Structural Equation Models (DSEM) showed that higher emotional intensity, regardless of its valence, was associated with increased positive ER strategy use. Using upregulation strategies was linked to improvements in emotions, while opposite patterns were found for downregulation strategies. Anhedonia did not play a consistent role in explaining individual differences in these associations. Our findings highlight the complexity of positive ER processes in daily life and the potential implications for mental health, and underscore the need for further research in this emerging research area."

Recent studies suggest that already infants show a similar sensitivity to variance in facial trustworthiness. However, prior studies on infant trustworthiness perception have always used artificially manipulated faces. The question therefore arises how infants respond to a larger variety of naturalistic faces, which are perceived by adults to vary in trustworthiness. To investigate this question, we presented 7-month-old infants with 15 different male faces which adults had previously rated in trustworthiness and measured ERP responses and looking behavior. When grouping faces categorically according to trustworthiness, no differences in ERP response or looking behavior emerged. However, when predicting the Nc amplitude from exact adult trustworthiness ratings, we found that higher trustworthiness ratings corresponded to larger Nc responses in infants. Our findings therefore suggest that, on a neural level, infants discriminate faces according to features adults associate with trustworthiness from naturally varying faces, and that their neural response tracks the naturally variance between faces. Furthermore, ecologically valid faces yield a different neural response pattern compared to artificially manipulated faces, highlighting the importance of using naturalistic stimuli to study social processing."

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a within-subject eye-tracking experiment, in which 70 participants completed a multi-attribute food choice task in hungry and sated states. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, participants’ preference for tasty over healthy food items was amplified by hunger. Attention mediated this influence of hunger on choice, as hungry participants focused even more on taste information than health information, leading them to make less healthy decisions. Testing an extension of the recently proposed multi-attribute attentional drift diffusion model showed that hunger decreased the weight of health information and increased the fixation-related discounting of this attribute. Together our results suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying unhealthy dietary decisions under hunger are characterized by a nuanced interplay between attention and the significance assigned to the options’ underlying attributes."

However, the task itself is monotonous and painful and requires numerous training sessions and some time before being effective, which has been a challenge for its widespread application. One effective means of facilitating perceptual learning is the empowerment of EEG alpha rhythm in the sensory cortex before neurofeedback (NF) training; however, there is a lack of evidence for VA. We investigated whether four 30-min sessions of GP training, conducted over two weeks with/without EEG NF to increase alpha power (NF and control group, respectively), can improve vision in myopic subjects. Contrast sensitivity (CS) and VA were measured before and after each GP training. The NF group showed an improvement in CS at the fourth training session, not observed in the control group. In addition, VA improved only in the NF group at the third and fourth training sessions, this appears as a consolidation effect (maintenance of the previous training effect). Participants who produced stronger alpha power during the third training session showed greater VA recovery during the fourth training session. These results indicate that enhanced pretraining alpha empowerment strengthens the subsequent consolidation of perceptual learning and that even a short period of GP training can have a positive effect on VA recovery. This simple protocol may facilitate use of a training method to easily recover vision."

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a within-subject eye-tracking experiment, in which 70 participants completed a multi-attribute food choice task in hungry and sated states. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, participants’ preference for tasty over healthy food items was amplified by hunger. Attention mediated this influence of hunger on choice, as hungry participants focused even more on taste information than health information, leading them to make less healthy decisions. Testing an extension of the recently proposed multi-attribute attentional drift diffusion model showed that hunger decreased the weight of health information and increased the fixation-related discounting of this attribute. Together our results suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying unhealthy dietary decisions under hunger are characterized by a nuanced interplay between attention and the significance assigned to the options’ underlying attributes."

A number of influential theories make predictions about how and why neurodevelopmental alterations may mediate or moderate the effects of the social environment on the emergence of mental illness. Here, we discuss current evidence supporting each of these theories. Although this area of research is rapidly growing, the body of evidence is still relatively limited. However, there exist some consistent findings, including increased striatal reactivity during positive affective processing and larger hippocampal volumes being associated with increased vulnerability or susceptibility to the effects of social environments on internalizing symptoms. Limited longitudinal work has investigated neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking the social environment with mental health. Drawing from human research and insights from animal studies, we propose an integrated mediation-moderation model and outline future research directions to advance the field."

The aim of the present study was to to capture the dynamics of positive ER processes in daily life by investigating (1) which positive ER strategies individuals use in their daily lives, (2) whether the intensity of positive and negative emotions is associated with the use of specific positive ER strategies, and (3) whether the use of specific positive ER strategies is associated with changes in positive and negative emotions. Secondly, we aimed to examine the role of anhedonia in explaining inter-individual differences in positive ER processes. A total of N = 159 emerging adults (Mage = 21.50, 76% female) completed a baseline questionnaire and enrolled in a 14-day Experience Sampling Method (ESM) study (5x/day), in which we measured positive and negative emotions, and positive ER strategy use. Results from pre-registered Dynamic Structural Equation Models (DSEM) showed that higher emotional intensity, regardless of its valence, was associated with increased positive ER strategy use. Using upregulation strategies was linked to improvements in emotions, while opposite patterns were found for downregulation strategies. Anhedonia did not play a consistent role in explaining individual differences in these associations. Our findings highlight the complexity of positive ER processes in daily life and the potential implications for mental health, and underscore the need for further research in this emerging research area."

Recent studies suggest that already infants show a similar sensitivity to variance in facial trustworthiness. However, prior studies on infant trustworthiness perception have always used artificially manipulated faces. The question therefore arises how infants respond to a larger variety of naturalistic faces, which are perceived by adults to vary in trustworthiness. To investigate this question, we presented 7-month-old infants with 15 different male faces which adults had previously rated in trustworthiness and measured ERP responses and looking behavior. When grouping faces categorically according to trustworthiness, no differences in ERP response or looking behavior emerged. However, when predicting the Nc amplitude from exact adult trustworthiness ratings, we found that higher trustworthiness ratings corresponded to larger Nc responses in infants. Our findings therefore suggest that, on a neural level, infants discriminate faces according to features adults associate with trustworthiness from naturally varying faces, and that their neural response tracks the naturally variance between faces. Furthermore, ecologically valid faces yield a different neural response pattern compared to artificially manipulated faces, highlighting the importance of using naturalistic stimuli to study social processing."

However, the task itself is monotonous and painful and requires numerous training sessions and some time before being effective, which has been a challenge for its widespread application. One effective means of facilitating perceptual learning is the empowerment of EEG alpha rhythm in the sensory cortex before neurofeedback (NF) training; however, there is a lack of evidence for VA. We investigated whether four 30-min sessions of GP training, conducted over two weeks with/without EEG NF to increase alpha power (NF and control group, respectively), can improve vision in myopic subjects. Contrast sensitivity (CS) and VA were measured before and after each GP training. The NF group showed an improvement in CS at the fourth training session, not observed in the control group. In addition, VA improved only in the NF group at the third and fourth training sessions, this appears as a consolidation effect (maintenance of the previous training effect). Participants who produced stronger alpha power during the third training session showed greater VA recovery during the fourth training session.

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g4pr2,2024-03-18,What different network models reveal about the relation of engagement to burnout,"Stefan Kulakow, Julia Moeller","Schoolwork Engagement and school burnout are both multi-facetted constructs consisting of multiple components, including emotional, affective and behavioral facets for engagement and exhaustion, cynicism and inadequacy for burnout. Although the desirable engagement and the undesirable burnout symptoms are negatively correlated, there are some individuals who report high levels of both engagement and burnout. Within-person analyses are needed to detect such engaged but burned out individuals, who are otherwise overlooked if common between-person correlations are examined. This study extends prior comparison of insights to be gained from between- versus within-person analyses. Based on the critique that multi-facetted constructs may be better represented in psychometric networks than latent factor measurement models (see Lange et al., 2020), we examined the relationships among and between the specific engagement and burnout facets with psychometric and residual network models and compared their insights to the common latent factor (CFA) approach. To account for the problem that within-person co-endorsements of engagement and burnout experiences may be overlooked with between-person correlations, we then compared the inter-individual correlation-based psychometric and residual networks to an intra-individual co-endorsement network. The present study shows how motivational research may benefit from utilizing and contrasting psychometric network models as they may help to examining specific facets of constructs and that the inferences and conclusions that are drawn might change in contrast to the use of conventional latent factor approaches."

A large representative sample of Slovak participants (N = 1233) filled in several measures of environmental value orientation, perceived psychological barriers and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. The parallel mediation models revealed that environmental value orientation predicts engagement in pro-environmental behaviour, and this relationship is partially mediated by certain psychological barriers, yet the role of the specific barriers varied substantially with different types of behaviour. Overall, however, the explained variance in pro-environmental behaviour was relatively modest (up to 31%), suggesting the presence of other important social, psychological, and structural variables as predictors in this regard. Our findings emphasize the intricate role of psychological barriers and demographic factors in shaping environmental actions. Understanding these complexities can help design targeted interventions to bridge the 'green gap' effectively."

Methods: The program's effectiveness was measured using a pre, and post-intervention design, with follow-up assessments (2 months later) to track the sustainability of outcomes, with a sample of 33 youth workers. The program consisted of an 8-day immersive training focused on self-compassion, mindfulness, and nature connection. Self-compassion was measured using the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) at baseline, immediately after the program (post-test), and two months later (follow-up).  Results: Statistically significant increases in self-compassion scores were observed both immediately after the program (19.81%) and at follow-up (25.24%) compared to baseline. The intervention led to significant increases in positive self-compassion constructs (self-kindness, mindfulness, common humanity) and decreases in negative constructs such as self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification. Notably, improvements persisted and even strengthened at follow-up, indicating the long-lasting impact of the program. Additionally, the study found no significant differences in outcomes based on demographic variables, suggesting the program's broad applicability. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the Natural Compassion program is successful in fostering self-compassion thus enhancing well-being among youth workers. The group delivery format of the intervention, which emphasized shared experiences in nature, may have contributed to a diminished sense of isolation and an enhanced sense of common humanity. Results point to the potential of integrating such interventions into youth work training and practice, with implications for policy and future research focused on community and mutual support mechanisms within emotionally demanding professions Further research with larger samples and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these initial findings and explore potential mechanisms of change."

It is proposed that this is because information in long-term memory is highly ordered and therefore in a low entropy state. In contrast, information in the environment has higher entropy and is more disordered. The low entropy state of information in long-term memory makes it more usable and may account for the effortless way in which it can be deployed when solving problems. Instructional implications of this view include that instruction may be viewed as the process of lowering the entropy of information so that it can be stored in long-term memory and that environmental information cannot be substituted for information held in long-term memory without a significant loss in efficiency and performance."

This disparity risks distorting our understanding of psychological phenomena by underrepresenting the cultural and contextual diversity of human experience. Research from lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is also less frequently cited, both because it is seemingly viewed as a 'special case' and because it is less well known due to language differences and biases in indexing algorithms. Acknowledging and actively addressing this imbalance is crucial for a more inclusive, diverse, and effective science of evidence-based intervention. In this paper we used a machine learning method to identify key topics in LMIC research on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), choosing ACT due to the significant body of work from LMICs. We also examined one indication of study quality (study size), and overall citations. Research in LMICs were often non-indexed, leading to lower citations, but study size could not explain a lack of indexing. Many objectively identified topics in ACT research became invisible when LMIC research was ignored. Specific countries exhibited potentially important differences in the topics. We conclude that strong and affirmative actions are needed by scientific associations and others to ensure that research from LMICs is conducted, known, indexed, and used by CBT researchers and others interested in evidence-based intervention science."

Recent work suggests that a DNA methylation can be used as a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure (MPS-GC),showing associations with maternal psychopathology during pregnancy and length of child psychiatric treatment. However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether the it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Methods. Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. Results. Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at birth. Conclusions. We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk."

This approach, though insightful, has two limitations: Firstly, it ignores the region-specific nature of green decision-making in the real world. In reality, green decisions are contingent on a multifarious blend of local factors (e.g., urban planning and state-level regulations) that collectively modulate the expression of one’s moral values into actionable green behaviors.  Secondly, climate interventions often target social structures, not individuals, and effective community-targeted interventions require nuanced, community-centric insights. Across two studies, we use advanced Bayesian geospatial modeling to examine how county-level moral values can predict green attitudes and real-world household carbon emissions after controlling for political behavior and important region-specific factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation anomalies, population density). We find that moral norms across 3,102 US counties in 48 states explain a significant portion of the variance in both green attitudes and household carbon emissions. Our results reveal that counties where purity and fairness norms prevail exhibit heightened green concerns and reduced carbon emissions. Conversely, counties with predominant authority norms display diminished green concerns and increased emissions. Moreover, the political leaning of a county is the strongest predictor of green attitudes. However, when it comes to taking carbon footprints, moral values have a greater influence than political affiliations. Our community-level findings have critical implications for the moral psychology of climate change, which can help design region-specific strategies."

Here, we used triangulation and analyzed the same data (N = 400) with additional models, including a latent change score model (LCSM) and multilevel regression analyses of person-mean centered scores. Only results from the original RI-CLPM were consistent with the conclusion of mutually reinforcing effects between curiosity and creativity while results from the other models contradicted this conclusion. Moreover, the novel model of spurious longitudinal associations (MoSLA) suggested that data might have been generated without any direct effects between curiosity and creativity. An aggregation of available evidence made us conclude that longitudinal associations between curiosity and creativity in the present data probably were spurious, possibly due to confounding by a trait common to curiosity and creativity and common auto-correlated state factors with effects on curiosity and creativity measured at the same occasion. The present study, and the available analytic script, can be used as a model/tutorial by researchers wishing to scrutinize results from the RI-CLPM."

Her vivid daydreams seemed indistinguishable from actual memories.  Case Report:   A 35-year-old woman with a lifelong MD reported three incidents of fabricating detailed false memories of events that her family confirmed never occurred: obtaining a new job, miscarrying twins, and hospitalization for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Conclusion:  This first reported case of confabulations in an individual with MD and visual disability suggests daydreams could potentially be mistaken for actual events in some MD cases. While sensitive, more research is needed on the prevalence of false memories among individuals with MD.

In support of our first hypothesis, we found an overall negative relationship between reflective thinking and BiG; and in support of our second hypothesis, we found an overall positive relationship between intuitive thinking and BiG. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that completing the CRT before eliciting BiG influenced BiG scores by priming reflective thinking.

In two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 141 and Experiment 2 n = 360) and a follow-up eye tracking analysis (n = 5), we found a linear decline in accuracy with increasing frames across seven tasks, which was not fully explained by differences in frame size, suggesting visual search challenges. Moreover, the studies demonstrate that highlighting specific frames can mitigate some visual search difficulties but, surprisingly, not eliminate them. This research offers insights into optimizing the utility of small multiples by aligning them with human limitations."

In the present study, we tested three hypotheses about relationships between reflective thinking, intuitive thinking (both measured using the Cognitive Reflection Test; CRT) and belief in God or gods (BiG) across 19 culturally and geographically diverse countries (n = 7,771). In support of our first hypothesis, we found an overall negative relationship between reflective thinking and BiG; and in support of our second hypothesis, we found an overall positive relationship between intuitive thinking and BiG. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that completing the CRT before eliciting BiG influenced BiG scores by priming reflective thinking. Given that this is the first large cross-cultural test of these hypotheses to have a preregistered analysis plan, to hold education constant across countries, and to use both Bayesian and frequentist methods, these results considerably bolster the evidence in support of the first two hypotheses and against the third hypothesis."

This approach, though insightful, has two limitations: Firstly, it ignores the region-specific nature of green decision-making in the real world. In reality, green decisions are contingent on a multifarious blend of local factors (e.g., urban planning and state-level regulations) that collectively modulate the expression of one’s moral values into actionable green behaviors.  Secondly, climate interventions often target social structures, not individuals, and effective community-targeted interventions require nuanced, community-centric insights. Across two studies, we use advanced Bayesian geospatial modeling to examine how county-level moral values can predict green attitudes and real-world household carbon emissions after controlling for political behavior and important region-specific factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation anomalies, population density). We find that moral norms across 3,102 US counties in 48 states explain a significant portion of the variance in both green attitudes and household carbon emissions. Our results reveal that counties where purity and fairness norms prevail exhibit heightened green concerns and reduced carbon emissions. Conversely, counties with predominant authority norms display diminished green concerns and increased emissions. Moreover, the political leaning of a county is the strongest predictor of green attitudes. However, when it comes to taking carbon footprints, moral values have a greater influence than political affiliations. Our community-level findings have critical implications for the moral psychology of climate change, which can help design region-specific strategies."

It is proposed that this is because information in long-term memory is highly ordered and therefore in a low entropy state. In contrast, information in the environment has higher entropy and is more disordered. The low entropy state of information in long-term memory makes it more usable and may account for the effortless way in which it can be deployed when solving problems. Instructional implications of this view include that instruction may be viewed as the process of lowering the entropy of information so that it can be stored in long-term memory and that environmental information cannot be substituted for information held in long-term memory without a significant loss in efficiency and performance."

Sahdra, Grant King, Jennifer S. Payne, Francisco J. Ruiz, Sayed Ali Kolahdouzan, Joseph Ciarrochi, Steven C. Hayes","Despite the global nature of psychological issues, an overwhelming majority of research originates from a small segment of the world's population living in high-income countries (HICs). This disparity risks distorting our understanding of psychological phenomena by underrepresenting the cultural and contextual diversity of human experience. Research from lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is also less frequently cited, both because it is seemingly viewed as a 'special case' and because it is less well known due to language differences and biases in indexing algorithms. Acknowledging and actively addressing this imbalance is crucial for a more inclusive, diverse, and effective science of evidence-based intervention. In this paper we used a machine learning method to identify key topics in LMIC research on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), choosing ACT due to the significant body of work from LMICs. We also examined one indication of study quality (study size), and overall citations. Research in LMICs were often non-indexed, leading to lower citations, but study size could not explain a lack of indexing. Many objectively identified topics in ACT research became invisible when LMIC research was ignored. Specific countries exhibited potentially important differences in the topics. We conclude that strong and affirmative actions are needed by scientific associations and others to ensure that research from LMICs is conducted, known, indexed, and used by CBT researchers and others interested in evidence-based intervention science."

Felix, Alexander Neumann, Christian Page, Marieke Tollenaar, Mona Bekkhus","Background. Recent work suggests that a DNA methylation can be used as a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure (MPS-GC),showing associations with maternal psychopathology during pregnancy and length of child psychiatric treatment. However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether the it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Methods. Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. Results. Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at birth. Conclusions. We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk."

A plethora of techniques exist, yet only a few are used within the psychological sciences (e.g., stepwise regression, which is most common, LASSO, and Elastic Net). The purpose of this tutorial is to increase awareness of the various variable selection methods available in the popular statistical software R, and guide researchers through how each method can be used to select variables in the context of classification using a recent survey-based assessment of misophonia. Specifically, readers will learn about how to implement and interpret results from the LASSO, Elastic Net, a penalized SVM classifier, an implementation of random forest, and the genetic algorithm. The associated code and data implemented in this tutorial are available on OSF to allow for a more interactive experience. This paper is written with the assumption that individuals have at least a basic understanding of R."

With DeclareDesign we can simulate data where the truth is known, and thus can identify which analysis is optimal for estimating the intervention effect, using “diagnosands”, including bias, precision, and power. The simulations showed that the NFER analysis accurately estimated intervention effects, whereas selection of a subset of data in the Cambridge analysis introduced substantial bias, overestimating the effect sizes. This problem was exacerbated by inclusion of multiple outcome measures in the Cambridge analysis.

Most research on ACEs has used composite scores, which precludes specific conclusions about the impact of individual adverse experiences and their frequency of occurrence. Objective: To investigate the association between exposure frequencies of single adverse experiences with psychological distress among emerging adults. Participants and Setting: A total of 2528 emerging Swiss adults aged 18 to 22 years (mean age 19.3) from a random population sample participating in the first wave of a cohort study.  Methods: ACE measures were 39 specific experiences for neglect (emotional, physical), abuse (emotional, physical, sexual), witnessing violence, peer maltreatment and parental psychopathology. ANOVA models were used to estimate the associations of exposure frequencies for each adverse experience with psychological distress.  Results: Single adverse childhood experiences were strongly associated with psychological distress in emerging adulthood, with considerable differences across experiences and their exposure frequencies. Physical and sexual abuse experiences were associated with psychological distress across all exposure frequencies, including if experienced only rarely. Emotional abuse, emotional neglect and verbal abuse by peers experiences showed associations with psychological distress mainly at higher exposure frequencies.  Conclusions: The severe impact of adverse childhood experiences on the mental health of emerging adults varies greatly depending on the specific adverse experience and how often a person had to endure them. Our research underscores the value of analyzing the impact of single adversities and their exposure frequencies alongside dimensional approaches in ACE research.

A plethora of techniques exist, yet only a few are used within the psychological sciences (e.g., stepwise regression, which is most common, LASSO, and Elastic Net). The purpose of this tutorial is to increase awareness of the various variable selection methods available in the popular statistical software R, and guide researchers through how each method can be used to select variables in the context of classification using a recent survey-based assessment of misophonia. Specifically, readers will learn about how to implement and interpret results from the LASSO, Elastic Net, a penalized SVM classifier, an implementation of random forest, and the genetic algorithm. The associated code and data implemented in this tutorial are available on OSF to allow for a more interactive experience. This paper is written with the assumption that individuals have at least a basic understanding of R."

Could it be that non-physical phenomena pertaining to the domain of psychology or even religion are also based on mathematical principles? In this work we propose a mathematical model that captures the essential features of the great spiritual traditions of the world in their full diversity. The model simultaneously establishes a solid theoretical foundation for psychology, providing continuity between ordinary psychological experience and spiritual realization.  The proposed model borrows generously from several branches of mathematical physics, including quantum information theory and fluid dynamics. Whereas in physics the connection between experiment and theory is fairly straightforward, relating one's psychological experience to mathematical Reality is more of an art form and requires  intelligence capable of interpreting metaphor. Thanks to centuries of investment in both arts and sciences, our understanding of human life and its purpose  can now be brought to a new level."

We present a critical conceptual framework as a non-linear heuristic that serves to identify and organize relevant elements of precarity in a presumably infinite number of contexts and applications. The framework identifies socio-political-economic contexts, material conditions, and psychological experiences as key elements of precarity. Another essential aspect of this framework is the delineation of interrelated and non-linear responses to precarity which include resistance, adaptation, and resignation. The article then summarizes selected implications of precarity for psychological interventions, vocational and organizational psychology, and explorations and advocacy about race, gender, and other systems of inequality.

Examining People’s Notions of Biological Variability,To be fetched,"People often display essentialist biases, which can lead them to underestimate within-species variability. This bias is especially pronounced when traits are described as advantageous for survival. However, it is unclear whether this bias is limited to the specified trait or encompasses complex trait interactions. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCp) to analyze people’s representations of biological variability, using ladybeetles as a model species. Participants either received contextual information about the benefits of ladybeetle color for survival, or survival-irrelevant information. Overall, participants held consistent beliefs about ladybeetle features, but those with survival-relevant context produced lighter and larger ladybeetles; this difference was consistent with survey responses. However, we found no significant interaction between MCMCp variability and essentialism scores, given our context manipulation. We discuss potential explanations for these results and highlight advantages of MCMCp for assessing biological variability, particularly when studying the development of essentialist biases."

This approach has yielded key findings in the psychological literature yet may not represent how people typically describe their experiences. We used an alternative approach, in which participants labeled their current emotion with at least one word of their choosing. In an initial study, estimates of label positivity recapitulated momentary valence ratings and were associated with self-reported mental health. The number of unique emotion words used over time was related to the balance and spread of emotions endorsed in an end-of-day rating task, but not to other measures of emotional functioning. A second study tested and replicated a subset of these findings. Considering the variety and richness of participant responses, a free-label approach appears to be a viable as well as compelling means of studying emotion in everyday life."

In addition, there is a focus on convex regularization (the graphical lasso), with the missing handling implemented using different calculations in model selection across various packages. To address these shortcomings in the current literature, we (1) implement a direct EM approach to handle missing values in network analysis using nonconvex regularization (specifically using the atan penalty) and a stacked multiple imputation approach suited for atan as well as graphical lasso, (2) standardize model estimation and selection to (3) facilitate evaluating the specific performance of missing data handling techniques. Simulated conditions vary network size, number of observations, and amount of missingness. Evaluation criteria encompass the recovery of the edge set, partial correlation bias, and correlation of network statistics.

Using graphical lasso with EBIC model selection, the two-step EM method performs best, closely followed by stacked multiple imputation. For atan regularization using BIC model selection, stacked multiple imputation proves most consistent across all conditions and evaluation criteria."

However, it is unclear how social interactions are related to loneliness when in-person interactions are limited. Data were collected between February 2021 and March 2022 from a sample of 581 university students. Participants reported their loneliness and participation in positive in-person or remote social interactions each day for 14 days. Results from dynamic structural equation models showed that participants felt less lonely than they usually felt on the days they engaged in positive remote interactions at the within-person level. Moreover, participants generally felt less lonely when engaging more frequently in remote interactions, but only when in-person interactions were restricted (between-person level). Some of these results varied by changing COVID-19 restrictions. Finally, for participants who felt lonelier in general, the effect of positive in-person and remote interactions on loneliness was less strong. These findings suggest that social interactions may buffer loneliness but are not as impactful for those who experience greater loneliness."

When listening becomes challenging, either due to the environment (noise) or the individual (hearing loss), the dynamics of lexical competition change, and word recognition can begin to feel effortful and fatiguing. In cochlear implant users, several dimensions of lexical competition have been identified that affect the time course of when lexical competition begins (Wait-and-See), how competition is resolved (Sustained Activation), and how quicky lexical targets are activated (Activation Rate). To investigate whether how listeners recognize words in challenging situations is related to how much effort they engage, a group of cochlear implant users (N=79) completed a pupillometry task as part of a larger battery of clinical and experimental tasks. Listeners who engaged more effort, as indexed by peak pupil size difference score, fell lower along the Wait-and-See dimension, suggesting that these listeners are engaging effort to be less Wait-and-See (or to begin the process of lexical competition earlier). Listeners who engaged effort earlier had better word and sentence recognition outcomes. The timing of effort was predicted by age and spectral fidelity, but no audiological or demographic factors predicted peak pupil size difference. The dissociation between the magnitude of engaged effort and the timing of effort suggests they perform different goals for spoken word recognition."

The present study examined the potential protective effects of school connectedness against childhood adversity when predicting adolescent mental health outcomes in 9,964 individuals (51% female, 81% white) from the Millennium Cohort Study. Structural equation models (SEMs) were fitted to examine the longitudinal relationships between childhood adversity, school connectedness, and adolescent mental health. Childhood adversity was a risk factor, predicting greater internalising and externalising problems and lower levels of positive mental health. School connectedness was a promotive factor as it predicted fewer mental health problems and greater positive mental health. Furthermore, school connectedness at age 11 was protective against childhood adversity when predicting internalising and externalising problems at age 14. That is, students with a history of adversity who felt more connected to school were less likely to exhibit internalising and externalising symptoms than those who felt less connected to school. Only school connectedness at age 11 was protective against childhood adversity, indicating that feeling connected to school at younger ages may disrupt processes linking childhood adversity to adolescent mental health. Schools should foster students’ feelings of connectedness to protect vulnerable individuals and benefit all pupils’ mental health."

Evidence on whether positive environments could play a role in reducing appearance dissatisfaction across the world is lacking  Objective. To estimate the prevalence of appearance dissatisfaction globally and determine the extent to which positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments are associated with appearance dissatisfaction in early adolescence.  Design, Setting, and Participants. Existing cross-sectional self-report data from the Children’s World Survey were analysed. Data from 35 countries in 4 continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America) were used. Data were analysed from approximately 85,000 adolescents between 10- and 12- years old in mainstream schools between 2016-2019. Questionnaires were administered by local teams in local languages. Multilevel regression models were fitted to the data. Analyses were pre-registered. Exposure. Adolescents reported on their perceptions of care, support, safety, respect, and participation at home, school, and in their neighbourhoods using a 17-item self-report scale. Mean scores were generated for positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments, which were used as the primary exposure variables.  Main Outcome. Appearance dissatisfaction was the main outcome variable and was measured using a single item asking adolescents to report how satisfied they are with the way that they look. Results. Appearance dissatisfaction ranged considerably across the world. Whilst, on the whole, girls and 12-year olds had higher levels of appearance dissatisfaction than boys and 10-year olds, this was not the case in all countries. Additionally, whilst all three positive environments were associated with lower appearance dissatisfaction, with adolescents’ home environments being the strongest predictor followed by schools and neighbourhoods.  Conclusions and Relevance. Positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments are all associated with lower levels of appearance dissatisfaction. These findings suggest that interventions within homes, schools, and neighbourhoods might lead to lower levels of appearance dissatisfaction amongst adolescents."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/bta5z,2024-03-15,Causal inference: principles unifying experimental and observational accounts,To be fetched,"Causal reasoning is closely related to interventions. We believe that if A causes B, then a change in A leads to a change in the probability distribution of B. This in- terventionist view of causality is natural to many, in particular to social scientists, because it is close to the standard paradigm of experimentation. This has led some to believe that the only meaningful way to obtain any causal claim is by experimen- tation. Here we suggest that causal claims can also be obtained from observational data, although with more limitations than with experimental data. We claim this by showing that the interventionist view of causality is on equal footing with searching for causal claims in observational data (causal evidence view of causality) in terms of the criteria to assess whether there is a causal relation. The limitations of obtaining causal claims from observational data result in more uncertainty, especially because of possible confounders; this uncertainty is made explicit in results from such causal discovery. We illustrate the possibilities and limitations with observational data in an empirical example on eating disorder symptomatology."

Several TSST adaptations for the presentation in virtual reality (VR) have been introduced and evaluated recently. Here we describe a freely available version, the Open TSST-VR. In two independent studies, we evaluated subjective, endocrine, and heart rate responses to the Open TSST-VR compared to an active control condition. In study 1, 50 men were randomly assigned to the Open TSST-VR or the control condition. Compared to the active control condition, the Open TSST-VR induced higher levels of subjective stress and significantly more cortisol responders. In study 2, we employed a balanced within-subject design comparing groups of 46 men and women. Again, the TSST-VR induced more stress than the control condition and a stronger cortisol response, but there were also order-effects suggesting that the TSST-VR is less suitable for within-subject comparisons. In both studies, we observed a substantial stress level (and cortisol responders) in the control condition indicating that future studies should further elaborate on non-stressful control conditions, either without any task or non-stressful active components. Overall, the Open TSST-VR is a versatile tool for collaborative experimental stress research that offers flexibility to a broad range of future research questions among various disciplines."

The inclusion of biological measures, such as HDL levels, which are related to cognitive performance, holds promise to refine the assessment of CR. To validate that a CR measure comprising years of education and HDL levels offers a better-balanced explanatory power than prior CR metrics. Methods: We assessed 378 FEP patients and 149 healthy controls for sociodemographic, clinical, and neurocognitive data. The sample was classified into CR1 (years of education, occupation, and premorbid IQ) and CR2 (years of education and HDL levels). This classification enables comparative evaluations of both indices using machine learning models. Results: CR2 achieved an AUC of 0.725 (95% CI: 0.616-0.834) for FEP patients using Support Vector Machine. In comparison to CR1, CR2 achieved superior performance scores in metrics: accuracy (CR1: 62%; CR2: 66%), F-1 score (CR1: 59%; CR2: 69%), sensitivity (CR1: 54%; CR2: 70%), precision (CR1: 66%; CR2: 69%), and revealed an ROC curve characterized by higher discriminative capacity. Conclusions: Compared to literature-based CR index, biological approach CR index shows higher reliability and validity, as well as a more balanced relationship between sensitivity and specificity in data classification.

Fostering the Development of Voluntary Motor Skills in Spastic Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy Child using a Novel Psychomotor Sensory Substitution Paradigm : A case report",To be fetched,"Background: Cerebral palsy, particularly spastic quadriplegia (SQ), severely impairs motor development. Developing voluntary motor skills is therefore one of the most challenging issues when considering these children! Movement relies on sensation, yet quadriplegia not only impairs motor control but also somatosensory sensitivity, particularly proprioception, hindering clear perception of body movement. Objective: The present project aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel sensory substitution paradigm utilizing visuo-auditory feedback through a serious game (SG) in fostering the development of voluntary motor skills among SQ children. Methods: We tested one 5-year-old girl with severe motor disabilities due to SQ, who are unable to sit or control her head (GMFCS grade V, SATCo score 0) and demonstrate no manual ability (MACS grade V). She can only voluntarily control her eyes, moving and focusing on a target when asked. The child is non-verbal but can respond to simple questions by looking at basic communicative targets. Using an EMG device, muscle contractions were translated into visual and auditory feedback according to a sensory substitution paradigm.  A right-arm contraction prompts the appearance of a cat on the right side of the screen, while a left arm contraction positions it on the left. Conversely, the onset of a spasm triggers a soothing melody. The child attended 9 bi-weekly 60-minute sessions at her institution. Data collection was conducted using video recordings reporting  1) the number of spasms versus voluntary movements event per minute, 2) movement pattern and 3) gaze orientation. A baseline before the intervention was established over 4 sessions of standard treatment for comparison. Results: our preliminary findings show that the sensory substitution SG we designed for this SQ CP child prove to be effective to provide visuo-auditive feedback to the child’s contractions and therefore allows the child to produce more controlled movements. Moreover, they highlight the potential of providing visuo-auditive feedback to the child's contractions as a substitute for impaired proprioception, restoring crucial cues for motor development and control."

In a pre-registered experiment with a nationally representative sample (N = 800), we tested the effects of survey instructions on perceived risk from common environmental health hazards. Participants were randomised to read instructions that made salient a relatively unfamiliar hazard (electromagnetic fields; EMFs), a familiar hazard (carbon monoxide) or no hazard (i.e., that the study was about environmental health risks in general) before rating perceived risk of a series of hazards. Results showed an asymmetric salience effect. Instructions that highlighted EMFs elicited higher levels of perceived risk from EMFs, but perceptions of other hazards were unaffected. Instructions that made carbon monoxide salient did not affect perceptions of carbon monoxide, but diminished perceived risk from other hazards. Effects were observed on widely used rating scales and on a novel policy budget allocation task. In exploratory analyses, we further sought to test the relationship between perceived risk as elicited by rating scales and revealed risk perceptions. Results showed that how often respondents report thinking about a hazard day-to-day best predicted choices in a hypothetical budget task and self-reported mitigative behaviour, even when other dimensions of perceived risk, such as perceived severity of the consequences of exposure, were controlled for. The results have implications for designing surveys to measure perceived risk of environmental health hazards."

Several TSST adaptations for the presentation in virtual reality (VR) have been introduced and evaluated recently. Here we describe a freely available version, the Open TSST-VR. In two independent studies, we evaluated subjective, endocrine, and heart rate responses to the Open TSST-VR compared to an active control condition. In study 1, 50 men were randomly assigned to the Open TSST-VR or the control condition. Compared to the active control condition, the Open TSST-VR induced higher levels of subjective stress and significantly more cortisol responders. In study 2, we employed a balanced within-subject design comparing groups of 46 men and women. Again, the TSST-VR induced more stress than the control condition and a stronger cortisol response, but there were also order-effects suggesting that the TSST-VR is less suitable for within-subject comparisons. In both studies, we observed a substantial stress level (and cortisol responders) in the control condition indicating that future studies should further elaborate on non-stressful control conditions, either without any task or non-stressful active components. Overall, the Open TSST-VR is a versatile tool for collaborative experimental stress research that offers flexibility to a broad range of future research questions among various disciplines."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/bta5z,2024-03-15,Causal inference: principles unifying experimental and observational accounts,"Lourens Waldorp, Franziska Schutzeichel, Peter J. de Jong","Causal reasoning is closely related to interventions. We believe that if A causes B, then a change in A leads to a change in the probability distribution of B. This in- terventionist view of causality is natural to many, in particular to social scientists, because it is close to the standard paradigm of experimentation. This has led some to believe that the only meaningful way to obtain any causal claim is by experimen- tation. Here we suggest that causal claims can also be obtained from observational data, although with more limitations than with experimental data. We claim this by showing that the interventionist view of causality is on equal footing with searching for causal claims in observational data (causal evidence view of causality) in terms of the criteria to assess whether there is a causal relation. The limitations of obtaining causal claims from observational data result in more uncertainty, especially because of possible confounders; this uncertainty is made explicit in results from such causal discovery. We illustrate the possibilities and limitations with observational data in an empirical example on eating disorder symptomatology."

Adolescents' dissatisfaction with their appearance is a modifiable risk factor of multiple negative health and wellbeing indicators (including eating disorders). Evidence on whether positive environments could play a role in reducing appearance dissatisfaction across the world is lacking  Objective. To estimate the prevalence of appearance dissatisfaction globally and determine the extent to which positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments are associated with appearance dissatisfaction in early adolescence.  Design, Setting, and Participants. Existing cross-sectional self-report data from the Children’s World Survey were analysed. Data from 35 countries in 4 continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America) were used. Data were analysed from approximately 85,000 adolescents between 10- and 12- years old in mainstream schools between 2016-2019. Questionnaires were administered by local teams in local languages. Multilevel regression models were fitted to the data. Analyses were pre-registered. Exposure. Adolescents reported on their perceptions of care, support, safety, respect, and participation at home, school, and in their neighbourhoods using a 17-item self-report scale. Mean scores were generated for positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments, which were used as the primary exposure variables.  Main Outcome. Appearance dissatisfaction was the main outcome variable and was measured using a single item asking adolescents to report how satisfied they are with the way that they look. Results. Appearance dissatisfaction ranged considerably across the world. Whilst, on the whole, girls and 12-year olds had higher levels of appearance dissatisfaction than boys and 10-year olds, this was not the case in all countries. Additionally, whilst all three positive environments were associated with lower appearance dissatisfaction, with adolescents’ home environments being the strongest predictor followed by schools and neighbourhoods.  Conclusions and Relevance. Positive home, neighbourhood, and school environments are all associated with lower levels of appearance dissatisfaction. These findings suggest that interventions within homes, schools, and neighbourhoods might lead to lower levels of appearance dissatisfaction amongst adolescents."

The present study examined the potential protective effects of school connectedness against childhood adversity when predicting adolescent mental health outcomes in 9,964 individuals (51% female, 81% white) from the Millennium Cohort Study. Structural equation models (SEMs) were fitted to examine the longitudinal relationships between childhood adversity, school connectedness, and adolescent mental health. Childhood adversity was a risk factor, predicting greater internalising and externalising problems and lower levels of positive mental health. School connectedness was a promotive factor as it predicted fewer mental health problems and greater positive mental health. Furthermore, school connectedness at age 11 was protective against childhood adversity when predicting internalising and externalising problems at age 14. That is, students with a history of adversity who felt more connected to school were less likely to exhibit internalising and externalising symptoms than those who felt less connected to school. Only school connectedness at age 11 was protective against childhood adversity, indicating that feeling connected to school at younger ages may disrupt processes linking childhood adversity to adolescent mental health. Schools should foster students’ feelings of connectedness to protect vulnerable individuals and benefit all pupils’ mental health."

Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that synchronizing activities may enhance cognitive performance. Unknown, by contrast, is the extent to which people’s individual traits and experiences influence their ability to achieve and maintain movement synchrony with another person, which is key for unlocking the social and affective benefits of movement synchrony. Here, we take a dyad-centered approach to gain a deeper understanding of the role of embodiment in achieving and maintaining movement synchrony. Using existing data, we assessed the relationship between body competence and body perception scores at the level of the dyad, and the dyad’s movement synchrony and complexity while playing a 2.5-minute movement mirroring game. The data revealed that dyadic body competence scores positively correlate with movement synchrony, but not complexity, and that dyadic body perception scores are not associated with movement synchrony or complexity. Movement synchrony was greater when the more experienced member of the dyad was responsible for copying movements. Finally, movement synchrony and complexity were stable across the duration of the mirror game. These findings show that movement synchrony is sensitive to the composition of the dyad involved, specifically the dyad’s embodiment, illuminating the value of dyadic approaches to understanding body movements in social contexts."

Most prominent among these issues is the challenge of defining and operationalizing a psychological construct valid for the entire lifespan. This entails both the questions of measurement equivalence and continuity and change in the theoretical meaning of a construct. We discuss six different psychological constructs from this perspective. The question that we ask throughout this endeavor is (with a twinkle in our eye) whether adults and young children are members of two different species. From a biological perspective, they are, of course, members of the same species, homo sapiens sapiens. However, the answer might need to be clarified from a cognitive developmental perspective. First, it is difficult to define a construct continuously across the entire lifespan. Hence, the question remains whether constructs such as depression or the self are similar or even the same in early childhood and old age. Second, it is impossible to apply the same measures to assess the constructs across the lifespan. Third, competencies, knowledge, and processing strategies change substantially, particularly from early childhood to later ages. Consequently, it appears that members of the “extreme ends” of the life span, infants and the elderly, seem to be members of “two different species.” However, once we have a theoretical understanding of which less specific measurement is equivalent, we can start to link the data on the construct development. Thus, we are not comparing apples and oranges because we build into the analyses the theoretically justified assumption that a limited set of lifespan developmental principles must and can explain how apples turned into oranges."

However, research has shown that seafarers’ fuel reduc-tion behaviors are hindered by goal conflicts and workload, reducing motivation and efficient use of automated supporting systems. Therefore, we examined sea-farers’ (N = 22) interactions with a DSS while planning routes in a high-fidelity bridge simulator. To gain a comprehensive picture, we assessed Usability, User Experience, Workload, Basic Psychological Need (BPN) fulfillment and Prefer-ences for Automation Types, and conducted interviews. Despite positive system evaluation, especially hedonic User Experience, our analysis of BPN data points towards a perception of reduced autonomy when using the DSS. Similarly, sea-farers frequently requested features increasing their autonomy (e.g. route editing). Our findings highlight the significance of considering BPNs, especially autono-my, in the human-centered design of DSS and automated tools for maritime transportation. Prioritizing these aspects can contribute to broader environmental and efficiency goals."

Sleep quality, an important association between job stress and inflammation has not been extensively studied. A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between job stress, sleep quality, and inflammation among female nurses. As the primary outcome measure, a composite inflammation score was constructed from five interleukins (IL-6, 8, 10, 1β, TNF-α). Among fifty participants (mean age 32±7 years, work experience 105±8 months), there was poor sleep quality among the high ERI group (p=0.021). Overcommitment(OC), an intrinsic component of the ERI, was related to poor sleep quality (β =0.21, p =0.025). High OC (β =2.4, p = 0.025) and increased sleep latency (β = 8.3, p =0.027) were associated with elevated inflammation. There was a significant interaction between ERI and OC on inflammation (β =5.186, p =0.017) and conditional effects of ERI on OC to inflammation only in the high ERI group (p =0.002), not in the low ERI group (p = 0.839).

To date, programs that address emotion socialization processes, such as Tuning in to Kids, have always been delivered in person, via group or one-to-one delivery. This study used a randomized control design to examine the efficacy of Tuning in to Kids OnLine (TIKOL). Participants were 150 parents of children aged 4-10 years old with challenging behaviors, randomized into intervention or 10-month waitlist control. Parents and teachers completed questionnaires at baseline and 6 months after the intervention (equivalent time points for controls) measuring parent wellbeing, parent emotion socialization, parent efficacy, child behavior and anxiety. Analyses, using mixed methods multilevel modelling, showed that intervention parents reported significantly reduced emotion dismissiveness and increased emotion coaching, empathy and efficacy compared to controls who did not. Parents participating in TIKOL also reported that their children’s behavior problems and anxiety were significantly improved. Greater engagement (modules watched and duration of support calls) was associated with more significant improvements. Findings support the efficacy of TIKOL in improving parents’ emotion socialization and reducing child behavior problems and anxiety, especially when efforts to support online engagement are utilized."

Herein, a sample of 1162 participants was recruited via Prolific Academic for an online study. Half of the sample reported taking sertraline (Zoloft) for at least eight weeks (sertraline group), and the other half confirmed not taking any psychiatric medication (control group). The sertraline group was further divided according to their daily dosage (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/day). All participants completed a susceptibility to misinformation scale wherein they were asked to determine the veracity of the presented true and fake news and their willingness to behaviorally engage with the news.  The results were compared between the sertraline groups and the control group. The results showed that sertraline groups did not differ significantly in the assessment of the truthfulness of information or the ability to discern the truth. However, those taking sertraline appeared to have a significantly increased likelihood of behavioral engagement with the information, and this effect was observed for both true and fake news. The research presented here represents the initial endeavor to comprehend the neurochemical foundation of susceptibility to misinformation. The association between sertraline treatment and increased behavioral engagement with information observed in this study can be explained in the light of previous studies showing positive correlations between 5-HT system activity and inclination to engage in social behaviors. It can also be attributed to the anxiolytic effects of sertraline treatment, which mitigate the fear of social judgment. The heightened behavioral engagement with information in people taking sertraline may, as part of a general phenomenon, also shape their interaction with fake news. Future longitudinal studies should reveal the specificity and exact causal nature of these interactions."

We predicted that participants’ search for the object would deviate from its actual location in direction of where the agent believed the object to be. Further, we tested how this altercentric bias would interact with an explicit belief reasoning version of the task, where participants are asked where the agent would look for the object. In a large, preregistered study (N = 113), we found evidence for an altercentric bias in participants’ object search. Importantly, this bias was only present in participants who conducted the explicit before the implicit task. These findings indicate that altercentric biases depend on the relevance of the other’s belief in the context of the task, suggesting that spontaneous belief processing is not automatic but context dependent."

In scenario planning, the capacity to brainstorm is an essential, core component of the process, even though few scholars and practitioners seem to return to Osborn’s original insights about the disciplined application of imagination. As the futures and foresight science community braces for the impending impact of artificial intelligence, we return readers to the fact that Osborn’s work, some 70 years ago, which championed human creativity, was written during the rise of the first “electronic brains” (i.e., computers) and all the potential implications of computing power. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to bring those AIs together; to recover insights from Osborn’s Applied Imagination and consider what those insights mean for our contemporary context rife with the concern and opportunity of Artificial Intelligence."

Job stress is associated with inflammation, that is a forerunner of distal outcomes, including mortality. Sleep quality, an important association between job stress and inflammation has not been extensively studied. A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between job stress, sleep quality, and inflammation among female nurses. As the primary outcome measure, a composite inflammation score was constructed from five interleukins (IL-6, 8, 10, 1β, TNF-α). Among fifty participants (mean age 32±7 years, work experience 105±8 months), there was poor sleep quality among the high ERI group (p=0.021). Overcommitment(OC), an intrinsic component of the ERI, was related to poor sleep quality (β =0.21, p =0.025). High OC (β =2.4, p = 0.025) and increased sleep latency (β = 8.3, p =0.027) were associated with elevated inflammation. There was a significant interaction between ERI and OC on inflammation (β =5.186, p =0.017) and conditional effects of ERI on OC to inflammation only in the high ERI group (p =0.002), not in the low ERI group (p = 0.839). Composite inflammation scores from various inflammatory markers may be potential indicators of adverse outcomes in burnout studies among healthcare workers."

Cross","The process of synchronizing our body movements with others is known to enhance rapport, affect, and prosociality. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that synchronizing activities may enhance cognitive performance. Unknown, by contrast, is the extent to which people’s individual traits and experiences influence their ability to achieve and maintain movement synchrony with another person, which is key for unlocking the social and affective benefits of movement synchrony. Here, we take a dyad-centered approach to gain a deeper understanding of the role of embodiment in achieving and maintaining movement synchrony. Using existing data, we assessed the relationship between body competence and body perception scores at the level of the dyad, and the dyad’s movement synchrony and complexity while playing a 2.5-minute movement mirroring game. The data revealed that dyadic body competence scores positively correlate with movement synchrony, but not complexity, and that dyadic body perception scores are not associated with movement synchrony or complexity. Movement synchrony was greater when the more experienced member of the dyad was responsible for copying movements. Finally, movement synchrony and complexity were stable across the duration of the mirror game. These findings show that movement synchrony is sensitive to the composition of the dyad involved, specifically the dyad’s embodiment, illuminating the value of dyadic approaches to understanding body movements in social contexts."

To date, programs that address emotion socialization processes, such as Tuning in to Kids, have always been delivered in person, via group or one-to-one delivery. This study used a randomized control design to examine the efficacy of Tuning in to Kids OnLine (TIKOL). Participants were 150 parents of children aged 4-10 years old with challenging behaviors, randomized into intervention or 10-month waitlist control. Parents and teachers completed questionnaires at baseline and 6 months after the intervention (equivalent time points for controls) measuring parent wellbeing, parent emotion socialization, parent efficacy, child behavior and anxiety. Analyses, using mixed methods multilevel modelling, showed that intervention parents reported significantly reduced emotion dismissiveness and increased emotion coaching, empathy and efficacy compared to controls who did not. Parents participating in TIKOL also reported that their children’s behavior problems and anxiety were significantly improved. Greater engagement (modules watched and duration of support calls) was associated with more significant improvements. Findings support the efficacy of TIKOL in improving parents’ emotion socialization and reducing child behavior problems and anxiety, especially when efforts to support online engagement are utilized."

However, research has shown that seafarers’ fuel reduc-tion behaviors are hindered by goal conflicts and workload, reducing motivation and efficient use of automated supporting systems. Therefore, we examined sea-farers’ (N = 22) interactions with a DSS while planning routes in a high-fidelity bridge simulator. To gain a comprehensive picture, we assessed Usability, User Experience, Workload, Basic Psychological Need (BPN) fulfillment and Prefer-ences for Automation Types, and conducted interviews. Despite positive system evaluation, especially hedonic User Experience, our analysis of BPN data points towards a perception of reduced autonomy when using the DSS. Similarly, sea-farers frequently requested features increasing their autonomy (e.g. route editing). Our findings highlight the significance of considering BPNs, especially autono-my, in the human-centered design of DSS and automated tools for maritime transportation. Prioritizing these aspects can contribute to broader environmental and efficiency goals."

Freund, Andreas Maercker, Mike Martin, Urte Scholz, Lilly Shanahan","With this article, we address some of the theoretical and methodological issues faced when attempting to take a developmental approach to understand a psychological phenomenon that encompasses the entire lifespan, that is, from birth to old age. Most prominent among these issues is the challenge of defining and operationalizing a psychological construct valid for the entire lifespan. This entails both the questions of measurement equivalence and continuity and change in the theoretical meaning of a construct. We discuss six different psychological constructs from this perspective. The question that we ask throughout this endeavor is (with a twinkle in our eye) whether adults and young children are members of two different species. From a biological perspective, they are, of course, members of the same species, homo sapiens sapiens. However, the answer might need to be clarified from a cognitive developmental perspective. First, it is difficult to define a construct continuously across the entire lifespan. Hence, the question remains whether constructs such as depression or the self are similar or even the same in early childhood and old age. Second, it is impossible to apply the same measures to assess the constructs across the lifespan. Third, competencies, knowledge, and processing strategies change substantially, particularly from early childhood to later ages. Consequently, it appears that members of the “extreme ends” of the life span, infants and the elderly, seem to be members of “two different species.” However, once we have a theoretical understanding of which less specific measurement is equivalent, we can start to link the data on the construct development. Thus, we are not comparing apples and oranges because we build into the analyses the theoretically justified assumption that a limited set of lifespan developmental principles must and can explain how apples turned into oranges."

Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data."

This project aimed to explore how a positive genital body image could be fostered among people with a penis by co-designing and developing an educational resource. Participants were 22 people in Australia who identified as having a penis and were involved in three phases of co-design focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to generate common themes across the data with each phase informing the next, culminating in a prototype resource being shown to participants in the final phase. There was a consensus that a brief, animated, educational video could have potential in promoting a positive genital body image in people with a penis. For video content, participants were not supportive of challenging the societal messaging around penis size that “bigger is better”. Instead, participants supported the inclusion of information about the range of penile functions, promoting acceptance of penile size/appearance and that fulfilling intimate relationships were possible irrespective of penis size. The feedback was overall positive for the final prototype video. To our knowledge, we describe the first co-designed educational resource for people with penis and contribute to the understanding of this understudied topic."

In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive validation of this measure, which we call the ‘digital questionnaire response time’ or ‘DQRT’. Using data from N=2979 users of a smartphone app, we examined how best to quantify DQRT, characterized its cognitive, clinical, and demographic correlates, established its psychometric properties, and highlighted substantial, but addressable, potential confounds inherent in the measure. We conclude that DQRT has important limitations, but on the whole can serve as a valid and reliable index of cognitive processing speed that can be gathered at unprecedented scale, unobtrusively, and repeatedly, during a variety of real-world digital behaviors."

Yet, to date, this causal role of anger in costly third-party punishment is underexplored. To close this gap, we conducted a series of seven studies (total N = 3249) in which we experimentally induced anger and assessed consequential behavioral reactions to unfair dictator decisions in the third-party punishment game (3PPG). In five studies, we used incidental anger induction procedures (imagery or autobiographical recall) that allowed us to induce anger without altering the specifics of the game. In all studies, anger was successfully induced yet did not lead to more punishment compared to an emotionally neutral control condition. In two further studies, we then used integral anger induction procedures (framing and regulation) to manipulate anger that originates in the game. Particularly framing showed to be effective: Here, the dictator’s unfair split was held constant across conditions but was either the result of giving little to or taking a lot from the recipient. As expected, participants in the take-condition experienced more anger than in the give-condition. Importantly, participants in the take-condition punished more than participants in the give-condition and the effect was mediated through experienced anger. Taken together, this series of studies provided evidence for the causal role of anger for third-party punishment but only if anger originates from the unfair act itself."

This inherent characteristic of an event to be well remembered is known as memorability. Memorability has been typically measured by performance on recognition memory tasks and is calculated as the proportion of participants who correctly recognize a repeated item. However, it is unclear what drives certain experiences to be more memorable than others and whether all aspects of an experience are better remembered. Lure discrimination can capture more nuanced aspects of our memories by measuring our ability to discern similar “lure” items that share overlapping features with items encountered previously. Interference across experiences is a major barrier that our memory system must overcome, yet we do not know how interference may impact the memorability of our experiences. Exploring this facet of memory can allow us to parse what drives certain experiences to be memorable or forgettable. To this end, we developed a memory task that varied image memorability and lure image similarity and measured both target recognition - memory for repeated images, and lure discrimination - discrimination of similar lure images. While effects of memorability were evident for target recognition, the impact of memorability on lure discrimination depended on lure similarity, where higher levels of interference did not benefit from memorability compared to lower levels of interference. Furthermore, these effects were time-dependent: memorability impacted memory immediately, but not after longer time delays. These findings suggest that the concept of memorability depends on how and when memory is measured."

Recent intervention studies apparently challenge this assumption, showing that personality traits can also change quickly and substantially. However, how frequently do such quick changes manifest in the general population? This study sought to determine (1) a base rate of year-to-year changes in the general population and (2) the extent to which these shifts are related to longer-term change patterns. We examined year-to-year change in Big Five traits with nationally representative data from 7,005 German participants, annually tracked for up to 6 years. Year-to-year patterns exhibited stability and change (e.g., ≥ 1 SD year-to-year change in ≈ 20%). Across participants, year-to-year trait score increases and decreases occurred in equal proportions, suggesting that in a given sample, year-to-year changes in different directions average out. Within participants, however, in all domains but agreeableness, year-to-year changes reliably propagated to longer-term trajectories. While much of the year-to-year change faded away in subsequent years, lasting shifts in individuals’ trait levels remained, particularly upon pronounced year-to-year decreases. Overall, (pronounced) year-to-year changes were relatively common, largely reversible, and yet predictive of individuals’ longer-term trajectories. We discuss how the results bridge set-point assumptions with assumptions of incremental trait change."

The frequent measurement enables a thorough grasp of the dynamics inherent in psychological traits, but it also increases respondent burden. To lower this burden, respondents may engage in careless and insufficient effort responding (C/IER) and leave data contaminated with responses that do not reflect what researchers want to measure. We introduce a novel approach to investigate C/IER in EMA data. Our approach combines a confirmatory mixture item response theory model separating C/IER from attentive behavior with latent Markov factor analysis. This allows for (1) gauging the occurrence of C/IER and (2) studying transitions among states of different response behaviors as well as their contextual correlates. The approach can be implemented using standard R packages. In an empirical application, we showcase the efficacy of this approach in both pinpointing C/IER instances in EMA and gaining insights into their underlying causes. In a simulation study investigating robustness against unaccounted changes in measurement models underlying attentive responses, the approach proved robust against heterogeneity in loading patterns but not against heterogeneity in the factor structure. Extensions to accommodate the latter are discussed."

In a previously reported study, participants read vignettes about a humanoid robot causing either a negative or a positive consequence. They rated the moral responsibility and intentionality of the robot, and explained the reasoning behind their ratings. In this paper we conducted (1) an exploratory cluster analysis on their open-text explanations of their ratings and (2) investigated the correlation between (a) the proportion to which participants descriptions contain words from each cluster and (b) their moral responsibility ratings. We found that the more words participants use from the “outcome” cluster, the more likely they are to attribute higher moral responsibility ratings towards the humanoid robot. Additionally, we found that the more words participants use from the “technology,” cluster the more likely they are to attribute less moral responsibility towards the humanoid robot. This suggests that moral responsibility ratings are influenced by references to the outcome of the robot’s actions, and to words related to technology."

However, these methods often rely on complex off-scanner processing to yield the most information and to extract quantitative biomarkers, limiting their practical use for studies, as well as their clinical translation. While community-driven software solutions exist for these advanced MRI methods, many aspiring clinical researchers face challenges in acquiring the necessary knowledge to effectively apply these tools. This guide, an initiative of the Glioma MR imaging 2.0 network (GliMR), aims to provide an overview of existing solutions, communities, and repositories with the ultimate goal of enabling standardization, open science, and reproducible quantitative imaging studies of gliomas. Yet, most of the reviewed tools and approaches to image data analyses may also be used in the context of studies on diseases other than glioma. Content This guide summarizes the state-of-the-art processing software solutions and the repositories/communities for the following advanced MRI methods: DSC; DCE; ASL; diffusion MRI; relaxometry; MRF; MRS; CEST; SWI; QSM; MRE; and task-based and resting-state fMRI. For each of those, after a short introduction about the method and output parameters, the required and recommended image processing steps and quality control measures are described, and we point to further literature for more details. In addition, an overview of openly available software tools that provide these functionalities for MRI processing and exemplify workflows is given. Wherever possible, the readers are guided toward existing inventories, repositories, and communities, which offer not only a collection of these tools, but also more in-depth guidance. Each part concludes with an appraisal of the estimated required expertise and future development needs. Conclusion This guide provides an extensive overview of the currently available processing tools that can help aspiring clinical researchers to obtain high-quality reproducible imaging data from advanced MRI scans of gliomas. While GliMR n is focused on glioma research, this guide will also be helpful for other clinical neuroimaging topics as general processing steps may not be specific to glioma only."

Yet, to date, this causal role of anger in costly third-party punishment is underexplored. To close this gap, we conducted a series of seven studies (total N = 3249) in which we experimentally induced anger and assessed consequential behavioral reactions to unfair dictator decisions in the third-party punishment game (3PPG). In five studies, we used incidental anger induction procedures (imagery or autobiographical recall) that allowed us to induce anger without altering the specifics of the game. In all studies, anger was successfully induced yet did not lead to more punishment compared to an emotionally neutral control condition. In two further studies, we then used integral anger induction procedures (framing and regulation) to manipulate anger that originates in the game. Particularly framing showed to be effective: Here, the dictator’s unfair split was held constant across conditions but was either the result of giving little to or taking a lot from the recipient. As expected, participants in the take-condition experienced more anger than in the give-condition. Importantly, participants in the take-condition punished more than participants in the give-condition and the effect was mediated through experienced anger. Taken together, this series of studies provided evidence for the causal role of anger for third-party punishment but only if anger originates from the unfair act itself."

This inherent characteristic of an event to be well remembered is known as memorability. Memorability has been typically measured by performance on recognition memory tasks and is calculated as the proportion of participants who correctly recognize a repeated item. However, it is unclear what drives certain experiences to be more memorable than others and whether all aspects of an experience are better remembered. Lure discrimination can capture more nuanced aspects of our memories by measuring our ability to discern similar “lure” items that share overlapping features with items encountered previously. Interference across experiences is a major barrier that our memory system must overcome, yet we do not know how interference may impact the memorability of our experiences. Exploring this facet of memory can allow us to parse what drives certain experiences to be memorable or forgettable. To this end, we developed a memory task that varied image memorability and lure image similarity and measured both target recognition - memory for repeated images, and lure discrimination - discrimination of similar lure images. While effects of memorability were evident for target recognition, the impact of memorability on lure discrimination depended on lure similarity, where higher levels of interference did not benefit from memorability compared to lower levels of interference. Furthermore, these effects were time-dependent: memorability impacted memory immediately, but not after longer time delays. These findings suggest that the concept of memorability depends on how and when memory is measured."

D. E. Vogelsmeier, Irina Uglanova, Manuel T. Rein, Esther Ulitzsch","In ecological momentary assessment (EMA), respondents answer brief questionnaires about their current behaviors or experiences several times per day across multiple days. The frequent measurement enables a thorough grasp of the dynamics inherent in psychological traits, but it also increases respondent burden. To lower this burden, respondents may engage in careless and insufficient effort responding (C/IER) and leave data contaminated with responses that do not reflect what researchers want to measure. We introduce a novel approach to investigate C/IER in EMA data. Our approach combines a confirmatory mixture item response theory model separating C/IER from attentive behavior with latent Markov factor analysis. This allows for (1) gauging the occurrence of C/IER and (2) studying transitions among states of different response behaviors as well as their contextual correlates. The approach can be implemented using standard R packages. In an empirical application, we showcase the efficacy of this approach in both pinpointing C/IER instances in EMA and gaining insights into their underlying causes. In a simulation study investigating robustness against unaccounted changes in measurement models underlying attentive responses, the approach proved robust against heterogeneity in loading patterns but not against heterogeneity in the factor structure. Extensions to accommodate the latter are discussed."

In a previously reported study, participants read vignettes about a humanoid robot causing either a negative or a positive consequence. They rated the moral responsibility and intentionality of the robot, and explained the reasoning behind their ratings. In this paper we conducted (1) an exploratory cluster analysis on their open-text explanations of their ratings and (2) investigated the correlation between (a) the proportion to which participants descriptions contain words from each cluster and (b) their moral responsibility ratings. We found that the more words participants use from the “outcome” cluster, the more likely they are to attribute higher moral responsibility ratings towards the humanoid robot. Additionally, we found that the more words participants use from the “technology,” cluster the more likely they are to attribute less moral responsibility towards the humanoid robot. This suggests that moral responsibility ratings are influenced by references to the outcome of the robot’s actions, and to words related to technology."

This project aimed to explore how a positive genital body image could be fostered among people with a penis by co-designing and developing an educational resource. Participants were 22 people in Australia who identified as having a penis and were involved in three phases of co-design focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to generate common themes across the data with each phase informing the next, culminating in a prototype resource being shown to participants in the final phase. There was a consensus that a brief, animated, educational video could have potential in promoting a positive genital body image in people with a penis. For video content, participants were not supportive of challenging the societal messaging around penis size that “bigger is better”. Instead, participants supported the inclusion of information about the range of penile functions, promoting acceptance of penile size/appearance and that fulfilling intimate relationships were possible irrespective of penis size. The feedback was overall positive for the final prototype video. To our knowledge, we describe the first co-designed educational resource for people with penis and contribute to the understanding of this understudied topic."

Recent intervention studies apparently challenge this assumption, showing that personality traits can also change quickly and substantially. However, how frequently do such quick changes manifest in the general population? This study sought to determine (1) a base rate of year-to-year changes in the general population and (2) the extent to which these shifts are related to longer-term change patterns. We examined year-to-year change in Big Five traits with nationally representative data from 7,005 German participants, annually tracked for up to 6 years. Year-to-year patterns exhibited stability and change (e.g., ≥ 1 SD year-to-year change in ≈ 20%). Across participants, year-to-year trait score increases and decreases occurred in equal proportions, suggesting that in a given sample, year-to-year changes in different directions average out. Within participants, however, in all domains but agreeableness, year-to-year changes reliably propagated to longer-term trajectories. While much of the year-to-year change faded away in subsequent years, lasting shifts in individuals’ trait levels remained, particularly upon pronounced year-to-year decreases. Overall, (pronounced) year-to-year changes were relatively common, largely reversible, and yet predictive of individuals’ longer-term trajectories. We discuss how the results bridge set-point assumptions with assumptions of incremental trait change."

Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data."

Donegan, Eoghan Gallagher, Anna Hanlon, Claire Gillan","Digital survey tools have all but replaced paper and pen in the psychological sciences and consequently new forms of potentially useful research paradata are now routinely gathered. A particularly common byproduct of research are questionnaire timestamps, which some have suggested can be used as a measure of cognitive function. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive validation of this measure, which we call the ‘digital questionnaire response time’ or ‘DQRT’. Using data from N=2979 users of a smartphone app, we examined how best to quantify DQRT, characterized its cognitive, clinical, and demographic correlates, established its psychometric properties, and highlighted substantial, but addressable, potential confounds inherent in the measure. We conclude that DQRT has important limitations, but on the whole can serve as a valid and reliable index of cognitive processing speed that can be gathered at unprecedented scale, unobtrusively, and repeatedly, during a variety of real-world digital behaviors."

Action-Outcome Learning in Synchronous Joint Action,To be fetched,"Goal-directed behaviour requires mental representations that encode instrumental relationships between actions and their outcomes. The present study investigated how people acquire representations of joint actions where co-actors perform synchronized action contributions to produce joint outcomes in the environment. Adapting an experimental procedure to assess individual action-outcome learning, we tested whether co-acting individuals link jointly produced action outcomes to individual-level features of their own action contributions or to group-level features of their joint action contributions instead. In a learning phase, pairs of participants produced musical chords by synchronizing individual key press responses. In a subsequent test phase, the previously produced chords were presented as imperative stimuli requiring forced-choice responses by both pair members. Stimulus-response mappings were systematically manipulated to be either compatible or incompatible with the individual and joint action-outcome mappings of the preceding learning phase. Only joint but not individual compatibility was found to modulate participants’ performance in the test phase. Yet, opposite to predictions of associative accounts of action-outcome learning, jointly incompatible mappings between learning and test phase resulted in better performance. We discuss a possible explanation of this finding proposing that pairs’ group-level learning experience modulated how participants encoded ambiguous task instructions in the test phase. Our findings inform current debates on the mechanistic nature of action-outcome learning and provide novel evidence that planning and control of joint actions is supported by dedicated mental representations encoding group-level features of joint actions."

To obtain Bayes factors, statisticians often require advanced, non-standard tools, making it important to confirm that the methodology is computationally sound. This paper seeks to validate Bayes factor calculations by applying two theorems attributed to Alan Turing and Jack Good. The procedure entails simulating data sets under two hypotheses, calculating Bayes factors, and assessing whether their expected values align with theoretical expectations. We illustrate this method with an ANOVA example and a network psychometrics application, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting calculation errors and confirming the computational correctness of the Bayes factor results. This structured validation approach aims to provide researchers with a tool to enhance the credibility of Bayes factor hypothesis testing, fostering more robust and trustworthy scientific inferences."

This number increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with timely face-to-face eyewitness interviews disrupted due to social distancing. While live-link interviews have been successful in legal and medical contexts, its potential for eyewitness interviews remains insufficiently studied, particularly in terms of non-verbal misinformation. This study explored tele-forensic interviewing (tele-FI) as an alternative to face-to-face interviews, with a focus on the gestural misinformation effect (GME). Forty-seven children were recruited ranging in age from 5- to 8-years-old (M=6 years 11 months). Comparisons to face-to-face conditions were based on prior work by the author (N=63, M= 7 years 2 months). Results find support for the GME during tele-FI, with 1.23 misinformation details recorded on average and tele-FI showing a similar response pattern as face-to-face interviews. Accuracy was shown to be comparable in tele-FI (M=16.21) compared to face-to-face interviews (M=14.02), with a notable increase in the amount of relevant information provided in the tele-FI condition. Age did not affect interview outcomes. This study provides further evidence for tele-FI as a viable alternative to face-to-face interviews and offers the first exploration of the GME in tele-FI. Discussion focuses on the benefits of tele-FI and the implications for police interview guidelines."

Based on existing bibliographies and systematic searching, we identified k = 86 works. Citation analysis found k = 7,571 citing published sources, written by 13,398 unique authors. The topics of citing work clustered around clinical psychological research, early dyadic relationships, romantic attachment, traumatic experiences, and the adult attachment interview itself. Based on co-citation patterns, Main occupied an intellectual space shared with authors known for work on developmental psychopathology and child development, parent-child relationships, adult attachment, psychodynamic theorizing, and reciprocity in interaction and infant mental health.

However, app-based psychological data also pose data-analytic challenges because of the complexities introduced by missingness and interdependence of observations. Consequently, researchers must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of app-based data collection to decide on the scientific utility of their proposed app study. For instance, some studies might only be worthwhile if they provide adequate statistical power. However, the complexity of app data forestalls the use of simple analytic formulas to estimate properties such as power. In this paper, we demonstrate how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to investigate the impact of app usage behavior on the utility of app-based psychological data. We introduce a set of questions to guide simulation implementation and showcase how we answered them for the simulation in the context of the guessing game app Who Knows. Finally, we give a brief overview of the simulation results and the conclusions we have drawn from them for real-world data generation. Our results can serve as an example of how to use a simulation approach for planning real-world app-based data collection."

This is based on evidence-based interventions to reduce compulsory psychiatric admission, with particular benefit for Black people, whose rates of compulsory psychiatric admission in the UK are over three times higher than those of White British people. Our aim was to explore potential barriers and enablers to effective implementation of ACDs for use by Black people with previous experience of compulsory admission.   Methods Seven online and in-person workshops were held with: Black service users who had previously been compulsorily admitted, carers/supporters of Black service users, and mental health professionals. Workshops were recorded and transcribed.   Results Inductive analysis was employed to identify recommendations and determine where there was a lack of consensus. Thematic analysis identified key themes of ‘people’, ‘process’ and ‘power’ pertaining to ACD implementation.  Discussion Our results reinforce the need for independent facilitation for ACD creation and their potential to empower Black service users in relation to their care. They suggest that explicit acknowledgement of, and time spent listening to, the historical and individual poor experiences that underlie the treatment preferences Black people express are important aspects of ACD creation."

The spatial compatibility of a stimulus and a response might interfere with the activation of these action plans. In the present study, we examined how framing of interactions affects the interplay between affordance and spatial compatibility effects towards humans and objects in two separate experiments. In a motor priming task designed to simultaneously assess these two effects, participants were presented with interactive hand gestures and objects with a single handle. Participants responded either with their left or right hand according to the color mask of the stimulus, regardless of the spatial position or the affordance-related orientation of the stimulus. In Experiment 1, when responses were given by keypresses, we found independent affordance and spatial compatibility effects towards objects. Surprisingly, interactive hand gestures induced a reversed affordance effect, e.g., imitative action tendencies. Changing the responses from keypresses to the performance of grasping actions in Experiment 2 drastically altered these findings, resulting in enhancement of affordance and elimination of spatial compatibility effects for both human and object interactions. These findings highlight the importance of contextual influences on the emergence of automatic action tendencies governing our daily lives."

It is impractical for biological or artificial computational systems to provide mechanistic models of themselves; instead, they can construct a mind: a simplifying — and sometimes misleading — model that accounts for behavior in terms of intentions, desires, goals, and emotions. Such a mind model can plausibly be implemented with typical neural mechanisms for computation and learning, and is remarkably consistent with human mental experience: a sparse and simplified account that prioritizes socially relevant information and distorts toward self-interest. The content of mental experience is proposed to be that which may be worth communicating about, and voluntary behaviors to be those whose motivations are worth communicating about. The social utility, feasibility of implementation, and consistency with mental experience together provide strong support for the hypothesis that the mind functions to communicate internal state."

Participants were randomized to view up to a total of 20 tailored versus non-tailored messages over one month. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and one month follow-up. We fit a structural equation model testing the effect of LGBTQ+ community-tailored, anti-smoking messages on quit intentions and mediating roles of anti-industry attitudes and beliefs (n=966). Anti-industry beliefs (indirect effect size = 0.024, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.040, 0.056]) and attitudes (indirect effect size = 0.034, 95% CI = [0.006, 0.077]) significantly mediated the effect of the tailored condition on quit intentions. These findings suggest that LGBTQ+ tailored cues in anti-smoking messaging may promote quit intentions indirectly through influencing young adult SMW’s beliefs and attitudes about the tobacco industry. Future campaigns to promote quitting among young adult SMW who smoke should consider incorporating themes to change their beliefs and attitudes about the tobacco industry."

Emblem, Elies Fuster-Garcia, Matthew Grech-Sollars, Jesper Folsted Kallehauge, Philipp Lazen","Background To date, multiple advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods beyond conventional qualitative structural imaging for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment follow-up of glioma have demonstrated their utility for clinical studies. However, these methods often rely on complex off-scanner processing to yield the most information and to extract quantitative biomarkers, limiting their practical use for studies, as well as their clinical translation. While community-driven software solutions exist for these advanced MRI methods, many aspiring clinical researchers face challenges in acquiring the necessary knowledge to effectively apply these tools. This guide, an initiative of the Glioma MR imaging 2.0 network (GliMR), aims to provide an overview of existing solutions, communities, and repositories with the ultimate goal of enabling standardization, open science, and reproducible quantitative imaging studies of gliomas. Yet, most of the reviewed tools and approaches to image data analyses may also be used in the context of studies on diseases other than glioma. Content This guide summarizes the state-of-the-art processing software solutions and the repositories/communities for the following advanced MRI methods: DSC; DCE; ASL; diffusion MRI; relaxometry; MRF; MRS; CEST; SWI; QSM; MRE; and task-based and resting-state fMRI. For each of those, after a short introduction about the method and output parameters, the required and recommended image processing steps and quality control measures are described, and we point to further literature for more details. In addition, an overview of openly available software tools that provide these functionalities for MRI processing and exemplify workflows is given. Wherever possible, the readers are guided toward existing inventories, repositories, and communities, which offer not only a collection of these tools, but also more in-depth guidance. Each part concludes with an appraisal of the estimated required expertise and future development needs. Conclusion This guide provides an extensive overview of the currently available processing tools that can help aspiring clinical researchers to obtain high-quality reproducible imaging data from advanced MRI scans of gliomas. While GliMR n is focused on glioma research, this guide will also be helpful for other clinical neuroimaging topics as general processing steps may not be specific to glioma only."

Based on co-citation patterns, Main occupied an intellectual space shared with authors known for work on developmental psychopathology and child development, parent-child relationships, adult attachment, psychodynamic theorizing, and reciprocity in interaction and infant mental health. We conclude by discussing the impact of the ‘move to the level of representation’ and how forging new ties with researchers unfamiliar with these ideas will be important to realize some of the remaining unused potential in the ideas and methods given to the field by Mary Main."

Johnstone, Dr Chris Martin, Mark Blades","In 2016, approximately half of children aged 2-17 worldwide experienced child abuse. This number increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with timely face-to-face eyewitness interviews disrupted due to social distancing. While live-link interviews have been successful in legal and medical contexts, its potential for eyewitness interviews remains insufficiently studied, particularly in terms of non-verbal misinformation. This study explored tele-forensic interviewing (tele-FI) as an alternative to face-to-face interviews, with a focus on the gestural misinformation effect (GME). Forty-seven children were recruited ranging in age from 5- to 8-years-old (M=6 years 11 months). Comparisons to face-to-face conditions were based on prior work by the author (N=63, M= 7 years 2 months). Results find support for the GME during tele-FI, with 1.23 misinformation details recorded on average and tele-FI showing a similar response pattern as face-to-face interviews. Accuracy was shown to be comparable in tele-FI (M=16.21) compared to face-to-face interviews (M=14.02), with a notable increase in the amount of relevant information provided in the tele-FI condition. Age did not affect interview outcomes. This study provides further evidence for tele-FI as a viable alternative to face-to-face interviews and offers the first exploration of the GME in tele-FI. Discussion focuses on the benefits of tele-FI and the implications for police interview guidelines."

Participants were randomized to view up to a total of 20 tailored versus non-tailored messages over one month. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and one month follow-up. We fit a structural equation model testing the effect of LGBTQ+ community-tailored, anti-smoking messages on quit intentions and mediating roles of anti-industry attitudes and beliefs (n=966). Anti-industry beliefs (indirect effect size = 0.024, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.040, 0.056]) and attitudes (indirect effect size = 0.034, 95% CI = [0.006, 0.077]) significantly mediated the effect of the tailored condition on quit intentions. These findings suggest that LGBTQ+ tailored cues in anti-smoking messaging may promote quit intentions indirectly through influencing young adult SMW’s beliefs and attitudes about the tobacco industry. Future campaigns to promote quitting among young adult SMW who smoke should consider incorporating themes to change their beliefs and attitudes about the tobacco industry."

To obtain Bayes factors, statisticians often require advanced, non-standard tools, making it important to confirm that the methodology is computationally sound. This paper seeks to validate Bayes factor calculations by applying two theorems attributed to Alan Turing and Jack Good. The procedure entails simulating data sets under two hypotheses, calculating Bayes factors, and assessing whether their expected values align with theoretical expectations. We illustrate this method with an ANOVA example and a network psychometrics application, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting calculation errors and confirming the computational correctness of the Bayes factor results. This structured validation approach aims to provide researchers with a tool to enhance the credibility of Bayes factor hypothesis testing, fostering more robust and trustworthy scientific inferences."

This is based on evidence-based interventions to reduce compulsory psychiatric admission, with particular benefit for Black people, whose rates of compulsory psychiatric admission in the UK are over three times higher than those of White British people. Our aim was to explore potential barriers and enablers to effective implementation of ACDs for use by Black people with previous experience of compulsory admission.   Methods Seven online and in-person workshops were held with: Black service users who had previously been compulsorily admitted, carers/supporters of Black service users, and mental health professionals. Workshops were recorded and transcribed.   Results Inductive analysis was employed to identify recommendations and determine where there was a lack of consensus. Thematic analysis identified key themes of ‘people’, ‘process’ and ‘power’ pertaining to ACD implementation.  Discussion Our results reinforce the need for independent facilitation for ACD creation and their potential to empower Black service users in relation to their care. They suggest that explicit acknowledgement of, and time spent listening to, the historical and individual poor experiences that underlie the treatment preferences Black people express are important aspects of ACD creation."

Action-Outcome Learning in Synchronous Joint Action,"Maximilian Marschner, David Dignath, Günther Knoblich","Goal-directed behaviour requires mental representations that encode instrumental relationships between actions and their outcomes. The present study investigated how people acquire representations of joint actions where co-actors perform synchronized action contributions to produce joint outcomes in the environment. Adapting an experimental procedure to assess individual action-outcome learning, we tested whether co-acting individuals link jointly produced action outcomes to individual-level features of their own action contributions or to group-level features of their joint action contributions instead. In a learning phase, pairs of participants produced musical chords by synchronizing individual key press responses. In a subsequent test phase, the previously produced chords were presented as imperative stimuli requiring forced-choice responses by both pair members. Stimulus-response mappings were systematically manipulated to be either compatible or incompatible with the individual and joint action-outcome mappings of the preceding learning phase. Only joint but not individual compatibility was found to modulate participants’ performance in the test phase. Yet, opposite to predictions of associative accounts of action-outcome learning, jointly incompatible mappings between learning and test phase resulted in better performance. We discuss a possible explanation of this finding proposing that pairs’ group-level learning experience modulated how participants encoded ambiguous task instructions in the test phase. Our findings inform current debates on the mechanistic nature of action-outcome learning and provide novel evidence that planning and control of joint actions is supported by dedicated mental representations encoding group-level features of joint actions."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qjcwn,2024-03-13,Goal-directed behaviour is associated with decreased temporal discounting,To be fetched,"Reinforcement learning models are broadly classified as model-based algorithms, which use an internal model of the environment to plan and carry out goal-directed behaviour, or model-free algorithms, which lack such a model and behave in a more habitual manner. Humans differ in the extent to which their decision making resembles that of model-based or model-free algorithms; the degree of this resemblance is related to individual differences in compulsivity, and is also argued to be related to the ability to imagine and make decisions about the future. Here, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit more model-based decision making tend to more frequently choose larger rewards later over smaller rewards sooner in an intertemporal choice task. However, surprisingly, model-free decision making was correlated with the specificity of personal future event narratives in an episodic future thinking task. Participants who provided more specific narratives had slower response times across all tasks, and may therefore have been more affected by time pressure in the reinforcement learning task, resulting in increased model-free decision making. We comment on the role of time pressure in behavioural tasks of the type used here. Future self-continuity, a construct conceptually related to imagining and making decisions about the future, was not found to be related to temporal discounting, model-based or model-free decision making, or episodic future thinking."

Here, we explore the possibility that learning fluctuates rhythmically several times per second, with fortuitously timed experiences being more memorable. Although such fleeting opportunities for encoding would evade our awareness, they are predicted by a prominent model describing how theta rhythms in the brain coordinate memory – the SPEAR (Separate Phases for Encoding and Retrieval) model. In a pre-registered study, we adapted a dense sampling approach to reconstruct the time-course of how well 125 people formed memories across milliseconds. We found that memory formation fluctuated at a theta rhythm (3-10 Hz), that these rhythms were not a byproduct of rhythmic attention, and that—like theta rhythms in the brain—memory rhythms were modulated by putative markers of acetylcholine. Critically, our findings provide behavioral evidence for the SPEAR model and reveal the finest timescale at which experience is carved up into memories."

Game theory offers a robust foundation for this understanding, based on the idea that individuals aim to maximize a utility function. However, the exact factors influencing strategy choices remain elusive. While traditional models try to explain human behaviour as a function of the outcomes of available actions, recent experimental research reveals that linguistic content significantly impacts decision-making, thus prompting a paradigm shift from outcome-based to language-based utility functions. This shift is more urgent than ever, given the advancement of generative AI, which has the potential to support humans in making critical decisions through language-based interactions. We propose sentiment analysis as a fundamental tool for this shift and take an initial step by analyzing 61 experimental instructions from the dictator game, an economic game capturing the balance between self-interest and the interest of others, which is at the core of many social interactions. Our meta-analysis shows that sentiment analysis can explain human behaviour beyond economic outcomes. We discuss future research directions. We hope this work sets the stage for a novel game theoretical approach that emphasizes the importance of language in human decisions."

Study Design. We analyzed 1,787 discharges with a focus on program completion, unilateral termination by the client/family, and lost contact with the client/family.  We performed exploratory analyses of demographic, clinical, and functional predictors of discharge reason. Variables predictive of discharge type were included in multilevel logistic regressions, allowing for estimation of predictors of discharge reason and variability in rates by program and hub.  Study Results. An estimated 20-30% of enrolled patients completed the program. Program completion rates were higher among participants who were older on admission, had lower negative symptoms severity, spent more time in education, employment or training, and were covered by private insurance (a close proxy for socioeconomic status). Programs were more likely to lose contact with male participants, black participants, and participants who were never covered by private insurance. After accounting for patient-level factors, there was substantial program-level variation on all three discharge outcomes, and hub-level variability on the proportion of participants who completed the program. The impact of race on program completion varied substantially by program.  Conclusions. Participants discharged from early psychosis intervention services for diverse reasons, some of which were associated with sociocultural factors.

Methods: Using a tactile cue-reactivity paradigm in a 3T MRI scanner, cannabis cue-reactivity was isolated in the brain.  Results: While the CUD group overall was more positive and less negative about cannabis and reported higher craving, the TX-CUD group reported significantly more positive and less negative attitudes and less craving than the NL-CUD group. Cannabis cue-reactivity was observed in the CUD group in clusters including the precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, frontal medial cortex, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus. In the TX-CUD group, a positive association was observed between symptom severity and cue-induced craving and cannabis cue-reactivity in precuneus and occipital cortex clusters, while a negative association was observed in the NL-CUD group. In these clusters, individuals with more positive attitudes exhibited a positive association between craving and cue-reactivity and those with less positive attitudes exhibited a negative association. No associations with quantity of use were observed. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of diverging relationships between cannabis cue-reactivity in the brain and cue-induced craving across distinct cannabis use environments."

Fifty-seven children with and without DLD were tested with a 30-item battery comprising equal numbers of 2-syllable, 3-syllable and 4-syllable words. The children with DLD (N=20) were compared with both age-matched typically-developing control children (AMC, N=21) and younger typically-developing control children with less mature language skills (younger language controls, YLC, N=16).

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qjcwn,2024-03-13,Goal-directed behaviour is associated with decreased temporal discounting,Isaac Kinley,"Reinforcement learning models are broadly classified as model-based algorithms, which use an internal model of the environment to plan and carry out goal-directed behaviour, or model-free algorithms, which lack such a model and behave in a more habitual manner. Humans differ in the extent to which their decision making resembles that of model-based or model-free algorithms; the degree of this resemblance is related to individual differences in compulsivity, and is also argued to be related to the ability to imagine and make decisions about the future. Here, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit more model-based decision making tend to more frequently choose larger rewards later over smaller rewards sooner in an intertemporal choice task. However, surprisingly, model-free decision making was correlated with the specificity of personal future event narratives in an episodic future thinking task. Participants who provided more specific narratives had slower response times across all tasks, and may therefore have been more affected by time pressure in the reinforcement learning task, resulting in increased model-free decision making. We comment on the role of time pressure in behavioural tasks of the type used here. Future self-continuity, a construct conceptually related to imagining and making decisions about the future, was not found to be related to temporal discounting, model-based or model-free decision making, or episodic future thinking."

This visualization process theoretically extracts and combines multiple perceptual features simultaneously into a simulated entity. However, experimental studies to date support only single-feature visualization processes. Thus, there exists a theoretical gap how human minds visualize words representing multiple perceptual features. Bocanegra et al. (2022) adapted the dual-feature visualization task from Potter and Faulconer (1979) that focused on color and shape as perceptual features only, to test the hypothesis of feature conjunction. This hypothesis predicted a dual-feature benefit - dual-feature word cues facilitated responses to visual targets compared to single-feature word cues - but this response benefit was only replicable under conditions of sequential presentation. Bocanegra et al. concluded that the visualization process is inherently a serial feature conjunction process. However, our pilot study using Chinese word cues detected a dual-feature advantage even under simultaneous presentation. Given that compound words constitute over 70% of Chinese lexical knowledge, it is plausible to hypothesize that comprehending Chinese words involves an immediate feature conjunction process during visualization. With a balanced evaluation of visualization processes between Chinese and English, we will enroll English-Chinese and Chinese-English bilinguals to administer Chinese and English visualization tasks in random sequence. If English and Chinese hinge on distinct feature conjunction processes, it can be predicted that the lexical knowledge of a language determines the conditions under which dual-feature benefits can be detected."

Youth were recruited through a partnership with a local NGO in southern Madagascar, which offers art and sports activities. A control group was recruited in a neighboring public school. Participants had never participated in NGO’s extracurricular activities before entering the study. Four data collection sessions were carried out over a span of 16 months. 96 participants engaged throughout the four data collection sessions. Mixed factorial Analyses of Variance were employed to test the objective.

It is crucial to examine how youth optimal development can be sustained in these extreme contexts. Extracurricular activities are considered a potential avenue, yet there is limited research on their impact, especially concerning long-term effects in adulthood. This collaborative study aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the long-term perspectives of young adults who engaged in extracurricular activities (specifically art-music and sports) during adolescence in the challenging southern region of Madagascar. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants (M=4; F=4), aged 19 to 27. The results indicate the value of these programs during their involvement, supporting basic psychological needs, acting as a protective factor against risky behaviors, providing a meaningful time investment, offering a nurturing environment for developing personal values, fostering personal growth, and focusing on education. Importantly, the programs appear to have a lasting impact, influencing participants' adult lives. They contribute to the development of enduring relationships, promote the acquisition of transferable cognitive and non-cognitive skills, facilitate the pursuit of new personal projects, and open doors to employment opportunities. Overall, the findings offer valuable insights into the significance of participating in extracurricular programs for youth in extreme contexts of development, both during and years after their involvement. Results underscore extracurricular programs as a valuable means to sustain optimal youth development over time, emphasizing their importance in challenging environments."

Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little attention in speech motor control. We present here the first detailed application of an active inference framework to auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence."

Attention-to-dimension theories suggest that, through prolonged exposure to their first language (L1), listeners become biased to attend to acoustic dimensions especially informative in that language. Given that selective attention can modulate cortical tracking of sound, attention-to-dimension accounts would predict that tone language speakers would show greater cortical tracking of pitch in L2 speech, even when it is not task-relevant, as well as an enhanced ability to attend to pitch in both speech and music. Here we test these hypotheses by examining neural sound encoding, dimension-selective attention and cue-weighting strategies in 54 native English and 60 Mandarin Chinese speakers. Our results show that Mandarin speakers, compared to native English speakers, are better at attending to pitch and worse at attending to duration in verbal and non-verbal stimuli; moreover, they place more importance on pitch and less on duration during speech and music categorization. The effects of language background were moderated by musical experience, however, with Mandarin-speaking musicians better able to attend to duration and using duration more as a cue to phrase boundary perception. There was no effect of L1 on cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. Nevertheless, the frequency-following response to stimulus pitch was enhanced in Mandarin speakers, suggesting that speaking a tone language can boost processing of early pitch encoding. These findings suggest that tone language experience does not increase the tendency for pitch to capture attention, regardless of task; instead, tone language speakers may benefit from an enhanced ability to direct attention to pitch when it is task-relevant, without affecting pitch salience."

We collected 632 Japanese participants across different regions in Japan and investigated a factor-structure, internal reliability and construct validity of J-SSDO. Overall, internal reliability of J-SSDO was low, while it was similar to that of the original scale especially in Asian languages. Yet, we found medium-to-large correlations between J-SSDO theoretically relevant variables such as attitudes towards aid to the poor, protecting ethnic/religious minorities, and more women in leadership positions."

Some studies show that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives, while others show the opposite pattern. If Chinese has an object relative advantage, this has important implications for theories of reading comprehension. In order to clarify the facts about Chinese, we carried out a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using 15 published studies; this analysis showed that the posterior probability of a subject relative advantage is approximately 0.77 (mean 16, 95% credible intervals −29 and 61 ms). Because the studies had significant biases, it is possible that they may have confounded the results. Bias modelling is a potentially important tool in such situations because it uses expert opinion to incorporate the biases in the model. As a proof of concept, we first identified biases in five of the fifteen studies, and elicited priors on these using the SHELF framework. Then we fitted a random-effects meta-analysis, including priors on biases.

Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility and impact of a brief intervention with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Method: This pilot study was conducted as single-centered, randomized control trial (RCT), com-paring a brief intervention with MI and supportive conversations. The sample size included 20 newly admitted inpatients. In both conditions they received two sessions per week. In line with CONSORT guidelines for pilot and feasibility studies, we measured various feasibility outcomes. Additionally, we assessed various clinical outcomes using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline values used as covariates. Results: The recruitment target (N = 24) was achieved at 83% in a reasonable timeframe (8 months), with a retention rate of 87% and completion rate at 71%. Eligibility rate (82 %) was high, while the consent rate (48%) was moderate and dropout rate 13% was low as well as the missing data (0.3%). With regard to the clinical outcomes, a group difference was found for the severity of psychotic symptoms, with an advantage for the MI intervention (b = -12.0, 95% CI: [-18.7, -5.2], p &lt; 0.01), although this must be interpreted with caution in view of the small sample. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a clinical trial with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute inpatient psychiatric facility.

In response, there is a growing interest in leveraging technology to empower patients with knowledge and skills necessary for effective self-management. This study investigates the effectiveness of two distinct technological interventions aimed at enhancing health literacy and self-management among patients with chronic conditions.The first intervention focuses on improving patient knowledge regarding the rational use of antibiotics through educational videos. Antibiotic resistance is a pressing global health concern exacerbated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Addressing this issue requires not only changes in clinical practices but also informed decision- making by patients. Educational videos have emerged as a promising tool for delivering health information in an accessible and engaging format. This study evaluates the impact of educational videos on patient knowledge and behavior related to antibiotic use, aiming to promote responsible antibiotic stewardship among patients. The second intervention explores the use of a mobile app-assisted self-management educational intervention to enhance asthma control among young patients. Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Despite the availability of effective treatments, achieving optimal asthma control remains a challenge for many patients, particularly young individuals. Mobile apps offer a convenient platform for delivering personalized education, monitoring symptoms, and facilitating communication between patients and healthcare providers. This study assesses the effectiveness of a mobile app- assisted self-management intervention in improving asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire. By evaluating these technological interventions, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of technology in chronic disease management. The findings have implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology developers seeking innovative solutions to enhance patient engagement, health literacy, and self-management skills. Ultimately, the successful integration of technology into  healthcare strategies holds the potential to empower patients, improve treatment adherence, and optimize health outcomes in the context of chronic conditions."

Studies to date showed that participants’ ability to tell the eye-of-origin most likely depends on contextual cues. Nevertheless, it has been shown that exogenous attention can enhance performance for monocularly presented stimuli. We questioned whether adults can be trained to discriminate the eye-of-origin of their perceptions and if this ability depends on the strength of the monocular channels. We used attentional feed-forward training to improve the subject’s eye of origin discrimination performance with voluntary attention. During training, participants received a binocular cue to inform them of the eye of origin of an upcoming target. Using continuous flash suppression, we also measured the signal strength of the monocular targets to see any possible modulations related to the cues. We collected confidence ratings from the participants about their eye-of-origin judgments to study in further detail whether metacognition has access to this information. Our results show that, even though voluntary attention did not alter the strength of the monocular channels, eye-of-origin discrimination performance improved following the training. A similar pattern was observed for confidence. The results from the feedforward attentional training and the increase in subjective confidence point towards a high-level decisional mechanism being responsible for the eye-of-origin judgment. We propose that this high-level process is informed by subtle sensory cues such as the differences in luminance or contrast in the two monocular channels."

Some studies show that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives, while others show the opposite pattern. If Chinese has an object relative advantage, this has important implications for theories of reading comprehension. In order to clarify the facts about Chinese, we carried out a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using 15 published studies; this analysis showed that the posterior probability of a subject relative advantage is approximately 0.77 (mean 16, 95% credible intervals −29 and 61 ms). Because the studies had significant biases, it is possible that they may have confounded the results. Bias modelling is a potentially important tool in such situations because it uses expert opinion to incorporate the biases in the model. As a proof of concept, we first identified biases in five of the fifteen studies, and elicited priors on these using the SHELF framework. Then we fitted a random-effects meta-analysis, including priors on biases. This analysis showed a stronger posterior probability (0.96) of a subject relative advantage compared to the standard random-effects meta-analysis (mean 33, credible intervals −4 and 71)."

Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little attention in speech motor control. We present here the first detailed application of an active inference framework to auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence."

Attention-to-dimension theories suggest that, through prolonged exposure to their first language (L1), listeners become biased to attend to acoustic dimensions especially informative in that language. Given that selective attention can modulate cortical tracking of sound, attention-to-dimension accounts would predict that tone language speakers would show greater cortical tracking of pitch in L2 speech, even when it is not task-relevant, as well as an enhanced ability to attend to pitch in both speech and music. Here we test these hypotheses by examining neural sound encoding, dimension-selective attention and cue-weighting strategies in 54 native English and 60 Mandarin Chinese speakers. Our results show that Mandarin speakers, compared to native English speakers, are better at attending to pitch and worse at attending to duration in verbal and non-verbal stimuli; moreover, they place more importance on pitch and less on duration during speech and music categorization. The effects of language background were moderated by musical experience, however, with Mandarin-speaking musicians better able to attend to duration and using duration more as a cue to phrase boundary perception. There was no effect of L1 on cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. Nevertheless, the frequency-following response to stimulus pitch was enhanced in Mandarin speakers, suggesting that speaking a tone language can boost processing of early pitch encoding. These findings suggest that tone language experience does not increase the tendency for pitch to capture attention, regardless of task; instead, tone language speakers may benefit from an enhanced ability to direct attention to pitch when it is task-relevant, without affecting pitch salience."

The inference is inherently affected by the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution of centrally-predicted ascending noxious signals. In this study, we examined the measurement validity of Bayesian likelihood precision in pain perception. Using a 2x2 fully factorial within-subject design, we measured and compared the precision of the distribution of centrally-predicted noxious stimuli in four tasks administered to 57 healthy adults: the cued-pain task (CPT) and the Focused Analgesia Test (FAST), in two noxious modalities, thermal and electrical.  A hierarchical Bayesian model was applied to the CPT, and the FAST was employed as a validation criterion, given that it is known to correlate with clinical pain reports and the placebo response. We found that individuals with a more precise representation of ascending sensory signals in the cued-pain task produced less variable pain reports in the FAST. We validated the result by replicating this correlation across thermal and electrical pain. These results support the validity of our approach to the measurement of precision of ascending noxious signals. Their correlation with FAST scores supports their criterion validity and their correlation across noxious sub-modalities support the concurrent validity of this measurement. In the future, the precision of noxious inputs could be used to quantify individual placebo susceptibility, and thereby optimise the assay sensitivity of randomised clinical trials of new pain medication."

We present a simple theory of how people use the explanations they encounter as both aids to sense-making and clues to the broader landscape of possible explanations. The computational challenge of coming up with novel explanations draws people to imitate appealing ones (information cascades); this draw increases as less appealing alternatives become more distant (the ``strawman'' effect). Conversely, pairs of divergent high-quality explanations can lead to merging and syncretism, and pairs of low-quality explanations to long-leap exploration. We then use a transmission-chain experiment to test, and confirm, these predictions, although, intriguingly, we find little evidence that the imitation that good explanations can trigger actually leads to better outcomes. Our work provides new insight into how collective exploration can be promoted, or stalled, both by what has been found, and by implicit information about what is yet to be discovered."

Over 20% of the population suffer from long-term pain. Unfortunately, there are no clinical tests that predicts who will develop long-term pain. The overall aim is to predict future pain incidence based on brain function, pain behavior, health status, and genetic variability. Method PrePain utilizes a superstruct design, which involves recruiting participants from ongoing research projects. Eligible individuals for participation in PrePain were over 18 years old and free from long-term pain. During the baseline visit, participants provide pain and health-related questionnaires, undergo structural and functional MRI scans, and provide a saliva sample for DNA extraction. Individual baseline measures are then routinely followed- up via national registries. Result We present quality-assessed data from over 300 participants. The average age was 34 years, and most participants were women (75%). Participants rated their pain sensitivity above average and reported low avoidance. Catastrophizing thoughts during painful episodes were rated as moderate. Assessments of (f)MRI data indicated generally good image quality. In this first follow-up, we found that 45 participants had a pain-related diagnoses. Conclusion Results indicate that a superstruct design is feasible for collecting a large number of high-quality data. The incidence of long-term pain indicates that a sufficient number of participants have been recruited to complete the prediction analyses. PrePain is a unique prospective pain database with a fair prognosis to determine risk factors of long-term pain."

Students provided narratives about the impacts of COVID and reports of mental health concerns, identity development, well-being. Students reported concerns for mental health, identity, and well-being during the first year of COVID impacts. The return to in-person activities predicted broad increases in narrative growth and concomitant decreases in COVID stressors, increases in identity exploration and commitment and increases in psychological and academic well-being. Changes in COVID stressors and narrative growth served as mediators between the return to in-person activities around campus and student outcomes.

In six pre-registered studies with US samples from Prolific (N = 5,095), we employed an intergenerational probability discounting task, discovering people discount the value of life as uncertainty and intergenerational distance from the present increase. Specifically, as uncertainty about impacting the future rises, individuals increasingly prioritize saving fewer present lives over more future lives, particularly for more distant future beneficiaries (Studies 1-2). Experimental evidence (Studies 3-4) suggests that certainty perceptions drive intergenerational concern, rather than the reverse. Drawing upon seminal research from cognitive science and behavioral economics, these findings address gaps in emerging social psychological inquiry into long-term intergenerational concern, reconcile debates on the ethical philosophy of longtermism, and offer practical implications for decision-makers in public policy, emphasizing the need to balance hypothetical threats to society’s future with its present-day needs."

McLean, Cecilia Wainryb, Monisha Pasupathi","The COVID-19 pandemic has defined the college career for this generation of learners, threatening mental health, identity development, and college functioning. We began tracking the impacts of this pandemic for 633 first-year college students from four US universities (M age = 18.8 years) in Spring 2020 and followed students to Spring 2023. Students provided narratives about the impacts of COVID and reports of mental health concerns, identity development, well-being. Students reported concerns for mental health, identity, and well-being during the first year of COVID impacts. The return to in-person activities predicted broad increases in narrative growth and concomitant decreases in COVID stressors, increases in identity exploration and commitment and increases in psychological and academic well-being. Changes in COVID stressors and narrative growth served as mediators between the return to in-person activities around campus and student outcomes. Findings expand insights of development and mental health across much of this generation-defining event."

We present a simple theory of how people use the explanations they encounter as both aids to sense-making and clues to the broader landscape of possible explanations. The computational challenge of coming up with novel explanations draws people to imitate appealing ones (information cascades); this draw increases as less appealing alternatives become more distant (the ``strawman'' effect). Conversely, pairs of divergent high-quality explanations can lead to merging and syncretism, and pairs of low-quality explanations to long-leap exploration. We then use a transmission-chain experiment to test, and confirm, these predictions, although, intriguingly, we find little evidence that the imitation that good explanations can trigger actually leads to better outcomes. Our work provides new insight into how collective exploration can be promoted, or stalled, both by what has been found, and by implicit information about what is yet to be discovered."

The inference is inherently affected by the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution of centrally-predicted ascending noxious signals. In this study, we examined the measurement validity of Bayesian likelihood precision in pain perception. Using a 2x2 fully factorial within-subject design, we measured and compared the precision of the distribution of centrally-predicted noxious stimuli in four tasks administered to 57 healthy adults: the cued-pain task (CPT) and the Focused Analgesia Test (FAST), in two noxious modalities, thermal and electrical.  A hierarchical Bayesian model was applied to the CPT, and the FAST was employed as a validation criterion, given that it is known to correlate with clinical pain reports and the placebo response. We found that individuals with a more precise representation of ascending sensory signals in the cued-pain task produced less variable pain reports in the FAST. We validated the result by replicating this correlation across thermal and electrical pain. These results support the validity of our approach to the measurement of precision of ascending noxious signals. Their correlation with FAST scores supports their criterion validity and their correlation across noxious sub-modalities support the concurrent validity of this measurement. In the future, the precision of noxious inputs could be used to quantify individual placebo susceptibility, and thereby optimise the assay sensitivity of randomised clinical trials of new pain medication."

Over 20% of the population suffer from long-term pain. Unfortunately, there are no clinical tests that predicts who will develop long-term pain. The overall aim is to predict future pain incidence based on brain function, pain behavior, health status, and genetic variability. Method PrePain utilizes a superstruct design, which involves recruiting participants from ongoing research projects. Eligible individuals for participation in PrePain were over 18 years old and free from long-term pain. During the baseline visit, participants provide pain and health-related questionnaires, undergo structural and functional MRI scans, and provide a saliva sample for DNA extraction. Individual baseline measures are then routinely followed- up via national registries. Result We present quality-assessed data from over 300 participants. The average age was 34 years, and most participants were women (75%). Participants rated their pain sensitivity above average and reported low avoidance. Catastrophizing thoughts during painful episodes were rated as moderate. Assessments of (f)MRI data indicated generally good image quality. In this first follow-up, we found that 45 participants had a pain-related diagnoses. Conclusion Results indicate that a superstruct design is feasible for collecting a large number of high-quality data. The incidence of long-term pain indicates that a sufficient number of participants have been recruited to complete the prediction analyses. PrePain is a unique prospective pain database with a fair prognosis to determine risk factors of long-term pain."

In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties lead to correspondingly lower performance in tasks that require temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. One must have the ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information to perceive speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis suggested that imagination difficulties predict the difficulty in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which leads to social impairment."

So far, however, little attention has been paid to how people deal with this development, primarily due to limited applicational opportunities. But with the release of ChatGPT, it suddenly became relevant how people perceive more complex AI-generated texts. Previous research suggests no differences between human vs. AI authorship regarding message credibility. However, only a few studies investigated actual AI-written content on complex topics or examined sufficiently large samples. In a between-groups experiment (N = 734), we examined readers’ perceptions of AI authorship of a GPT-written science journalism article. The results of an equivalence test showed that labeling a GPT-written text as AI-written vs. human-written reduced the article’s credibility (d = 0.36). Moreover, AI authorship decreased the source’s perceived credibility (d = 0.24), anthropomorphism (d = 0.67), and intelligence (d = 0.41). Thus, the mere perception of an AI as an author of a text has a small but significant effect on credibility perceptions. The findings are discussed against the backdrop of a growing availability of AI-generated content and a greater awareness of AI authorship."

However, providing high quality feedback can be time-intensive and challenging, and students frequently report dissatisfaction with feedback quality. Here we explore a possible solution, namely using large language models (LLMs) to augment feedback provided by instructors. One potential obstacle to using LLM-augmented feedback is algorithm aversion, which might lead students to deprecate LLM-augmented feedback. Therefore, we examined students’ perceptions of human versus LLM-augmented feedback. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 112) evaluated original human-generated versus LLM-augmented feedback on a previous assignment. Our results show evidence against algorithm aversion. Furthermore, participants rated the quality of LLM-augmented feedback substantially higher and strongly preferred it over the human-generated original. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to solve the persistent problem of low perceived feedback quality in higher education."

However, as children typically learn object labels through interactions with familiar partners, this study examines whether the active learning advantage persists in dynamic face-to-face interactions and is influenced by the social partner's identity (mother or friend). Using the Dyadic Interaction Platform for children (DIPc), we observed 4- to 5-year-old children and their social partners (Nfriend = 47, Nmum = 44) during a word learning task. Participants could actively select objects for labelling and passively observe their partner's choices. Results showed that children initially recognized actively sampled object names better, but later, they showed stronger recognition for passively observed names. The initial active benefit primarily occurred during interactions among children, while the later passive benefit was predominantly rooted in interactions with children and their mothers. Together, these findings identify the temporal and social dynamics of an active learning benefit within children's social interaction."

Whether we find the precursors of these co-speech gestures in infants before they master their native language still remains an open question. Except for deictic gestures, there is little agreement on the existence of iconic, non-referential and symbolic gestures before children start producing their first words. Here, we bridge this knowledge gap by leveraging an ethological method already established for describing speech independent gestures in nonhuman primates, to analyse the spontaneous gestures produced by infants when interacting with their caregivers. We manually annotated video recordings of infant-caregiver interactions (26h) from the CHILDES platform, to describe the gesture forms, types and functions in six infants from 12 to 15 months of age. We describe 62 gesture forms in the pre-speech repertoire. These were categorised into deictic, iconic, non-referential and symbolic gesture types, similar to co-speech gesture types. We also find that the type-function relation of pre-speech gestures map similarly to type-meaning relation of co-speech gestures. Taken together, our results illustrate linguistic properties of infant gestures in the absence of speech, suggesting them to be precursors of co-speech gestures."

Using prospective longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), this preregistered study examined whether socioeconomic disadvantage related differentially to depressive symptoms (n=3012-3530) and cortical and subcortical structures (n=460-733) in emerging adults, depending on the timing of exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage. Family income in early childhood and own income measured concurrently were both significantly related to depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Similar results were observed for perceived financial difficulties. In contrast, only family income in early childhood was associated with brain structure in emerging adulthood, with positive associations with intracranial volume and total and regional cortical surface area. The findings suggest that both objective and subjective aspects of one’s financial standing throughout development relate to depressive symptoms in adulthood, but that specifically early life family income is related to brain structural features in emerging adulthood. This suggests that associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and brain structure originate early in neurodevelopment, highlighting the role of timing of socioeconomic disadvantage."

In the lab, showing substantial learning of such dependencies is challenging. In this study, we explored whether a brief prior exposure of an easy-to-learn long distance dependency structure could facilitate the acquisition of difficult-to-learn multiple non-adjacent dependencies (Experiment 1) and whether the effect is constrained by prior long-term knowledge of such types of dependency (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we found that the subsequent implicit learning of the new multiple non-adjacent dependencies could benefit from brief prior exposure to learnable non-adjacent dependencies compared to Non-Learnable and Unstructured conditions (which have unreliable or neutral prior materials). This facilitative effect was neither cumulative learning over time nor a simple superimposition of the pre-exposure and exposure phases. In Experiment 2, we further found that the brief prior exposure could override biases from long-term experience to improve implicit learning of multiple non-adjacent rules which conflicted with native language experience. The results reported in both studies have been certified as computationally reproducible by an independent statistician. These findings demonstrated that implicitly acquiring multiple non-adjacent dependencies can be facilitated by brief prior exposure to a learnable structure. This powerful facilitative effect can override the constraints provided by long-term experience."

Norbom, Eira Ranheim Aksnes, Mona Bekkhus, Alexandra Havdahl, Eveline Crone","Prior studies have reported associations between socioeconomic disadvantage, brain structure and mental health outcomes, but the timing of these relations is not well understood. Using prospective longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), this preregistered study examined whether socioeconomic disadvantage related differentially to depressive symptoms (n=3012-3530) and cortical and subcortical structures (n=460-733) in emerging adults, depending on the timing of exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage. Family income in early childhood and own income measured concurrently were both significantly related to depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Similar results were observed for perceived financial difficulties. In contrast, only family income in early childhood was associated with brain structure in emerging adulthood, with positive associations with intracranial volume and total and regional cortical surface area. The findings suggest that both objective and subjective aspects of one’s financial standing throughout development relate to depressive symptoms in adulthood, but that specifically early life family income is related to brain structural features in emerging adulthood. This suggests that associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and brain structure originate early in neurodevelopment, highlighting the role of timing of socioeconomic disadvantage."

So far, however, little attention has been paid to how people deal with this development, primarily due to limited applicational opportunities. But with the release of ChatGPT, it suddenly became relevant how people perceive more complex AI-generated texts. Previous research suggests no differences between human vs. AI authorship regarding message credibility. However, only a few studies investigated actual AI-written content on complex topics or examined sufficiently large samples. In a between-groups experiment (N = 734), we examined readers’ perceptions of AI authorship of a GPT-written science journalism article. The results of an equivalence test showed that labeling a GPT-written text as AI-written vs. human-written reduced the article’s credibility (d = 0.36). Moreover, AI authorship decreased the source’s perceived credibility (d = 0.24), anthropomorphism (d = 0.67), and intelligence (d = 0.41). Thus, the mere perception of an AI as an author of a text has a small but significant effect on credibility perceptions. The findings are discussed against the backdrop of a growing availability of AI-generated content and a greater awareness of AI authorship."

Whether we find the precursors of these co-speech gestures in infants before they master their native language still remains an open question. Except for deictic gestures, there is little agreement on the existence of iconic, non-referential and symbolic gestures before children start producing their first words. Here, we bridge this knowledge gap by leveraging an ethological method already established for describing speech independent gestures in nonhuman primates, to analyse the spontaneous gestures produced by infants when interacting with their caregivers. We manually annotated video recordings of infant-caregiver interactions (26h) from the CHILDES platform, to describe the gesture forms, types and functions in six infants from 12 to 15 months of age. We describe 62 gesture forms in the pre-speech repertoire. These were categorised into deictic, iconic, non-referential and symbolic gesture types, similar to co-speech gesture types. We also find that the type-function relation of pre-speech gestures map similarly to type-meaning relation of co-speech gestures. Taken together, our results illustrate linguistic properties of infant gestures in the absence of speech, suggesting them to be precursors of co-speech gestures."

In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties lead to correspondingly lower performance in tasks that require temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. One must have the ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information to perceive speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis suggested that imagination difficulties predict the difficulty in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which leads to social impairment."

However, providing high quality feedback can be time-intensive and challenging, and students frequently report dissatisfaction with feedback quality. Here we explore a possible solution, namely using large language models (LLMs) to augment feedback provided by instructors. One potential obstacle to using LLM-augmented feedback is algorithm aversion, which might lead students to deprecate LLM-augmented feedback. Therefore, we examined students’ perceptions of human versus LLM-augmented feedback. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 112) evaluated original human-generated versus LLM-augmented feedback on a previous assignment. Our results show evidence against algorithm aversion. Furthermore, participants rated the quality of LLM-augmented feedback substantially higher and strongly preferred it over the human-generated original. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to solve the persistent problem of low perceived feedback quality in higher education."

In the lab, showing substantial learning of such dependencies is challenging. In this study, we explored whether a brief prior exposure of an easy-to-learn long distance dependency structure could facilitate the acquisition of difficult-to-learn multiple non-adjacent dependencies (Experiment 1) and whether the effect is constrained by prior long-term knowledge of such types of dependency (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we found that the subsequent implicit learning of the new multiple non-adjacent dependencies could benefit from brief prior exposure to learnable non-adjacent dependencies compared to Non-Learnable and Unstructured conditions (which have unreliable or neutral prior materials). This facilitative effect was neither cumulative learning over time nor a simple superimposition of the pre-exposure and exposure phases. In Experiment 2, we further found that the brief prior exposure could override biases from long-term experience to improve implicit learning of multiple non-adjacent rules which conflicted with native language experience. The results reported in both studies have been certified as computationally reproducible by an independent statistician. These findings demonstrated that implicitly acquiring multiple non-adjacent dependencies can be facilitated by brief prior exposure to a learnable structure. This powerful facilitative effect can override the constraints provided by long-term experience."

It has recently become clear that consciously interpreting a fake body as one’s own, in a top-down manner, also influences these body illusions. Furthermore, a study interestingly found that the influence of top-down interpretation is moderated by the degree of depersonalization, which is a symptom of a lack of sense of body ownership. In a case study of depersonalization, it has been suggested that a top-down interpretation of one’s own body as a negative physical state makes it difficult to feel a sense of body ownership, but this has not been examined. In the present study, we examined the influence of negative top-down interpretation using an FBI procedure in which a fake body was instructed to be viewed as a negative self-body (“View the virtual body’s back while regarding the virtual body as your own experiencing abdominal pain”). We used skin conductance responses to the fear stimulus presented after the visual-tactile stimuli presentation as the degree of FBI. The results indicated that no difference in skin conductance response was observed between the synchronous and asynchronous presentation of visual-tactile stimuli when the participants were instructed to interpret the virtual body as their own in a negative physical state (Z = -0.877, p = 0.381), and the degree of FBI was smaller than when the participants were instructed to interpret the virtual body top-down as a neutral self-body (Z = 2.159, p = 0.031). This study’s finding that the FBI was inhibited by manipulation of the top-down interpretation suggested that top-down interpretation can be a factor that inhibits the creation of a sense of body ownership."

However, it remains unclear how different forms of discrimination (i.e., overt and subtle) predict well-being over time, and whether ERI exploration and commitment mediate or moderate this association. This preregistered study explored the associations of overt and subtle discrimination with well-being (i.e., depression, substance use, life satisfaction) in a sample of 323 ethnic-racial minoritized college students (Mage W1 = 18.03, 62.7% female) from longitudinal data collected in the US. Cross-lagged panel models across three waves indicated no associations of overt discrimination, but participants experiencing more subtle discrimination during their transition to college reported more depressive symptoms after four months. ERI did not function as mediator or moderator. Findings indicate the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of ERI during emerging adulthood."

Twelve right-handed participants performed three motor tasks, two types of reaching movements, and one finger-lifting movement. Reaching movements were performed from the home position to 15 target locations (5 directions and 3 distances), as quickly and precisely as possible, under two conditions: with and without pre-cueing of the target. The finger lifting movement was performed by lifting the index finger (from the home position) upward in the air as quickly as possible. The reaction time (RT), movement time (MT), and temporal kinematics of the index finger were obtained for each condition. In addition, differential RTs (DRT) were induced, implicitly representing the time required for the motor planning process to execute reaching movements. The results showed that the anisotropy of the DRTs was largest in the left-forward direction, suggesting that the temporal costs of the motor planning process depended on the movement direction. For the kinematic analysis, the MT in the left-forward direction was the largest among all directions. In addition, the time from peak velocity to termination of movement (TFPV) was significantly longer in the left-forward direction when the target pre-cueing was not provided than when it was provided. These results suggest that if a reaching movement under no-cue condition is initiated with insufficient time for the motor planning process, especially in the direction requiring large temporal costs, it relies more heavily on the online control process to accomplish the intended performance. It is likely that humans achieve their intended movements by allocating the amount of time before and after movement initiation according to the difficulty of control that varies in relation to the movement direction."

Understanding its genetic basis has become increasingly important, with the advent of polygenic scores (PGS) offering insights into the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. This review paper provides an overview of the genetic architecture of depression and introduces PGS for depression, highlighting their potential applications in research and clinical settings. We discuss the complexities of depression as a polygenic trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, emphasizing the importance of integrating non-genetic risk factors to improve risk prediction models. Additionally, we review key findings from studies investigating the relationship between PGS for depression and various environmental factors such as stressful life events, childhood trauma, social support, and physical activity. While the evidence on gene-environment interactions in depression remains inconsistent, emerging research suggests that certain environmental factors may exacerbate or mitigate genetic susceptibility to depression. We conclude by emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these interactions and to identify protective factors that can inform targeted interventions for depression. Overall, incorporating PGS for depression into research endeavors holds promise for advancing our understanding of depression etiology and improving risk assessment and intervention strategies."

This study aims to explore the efficacy of social media campaigns in promoting mental health awareness among college students. Leveraging a mixed-methods approach, both quantitative and qualitative data will be gathered to comprehensively assess the impact of social media campaigns on students' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding mental health. The quantitative aspect of the study will involve surveying a diverse sample of college students to measure their exposure to mental health-related content on social media platforms, their perceptions of the effectiveness of such campaigns, and their attitudes towards seeking help for mental health concerns. Additionally, the survey will assess changes in students' knowledge of mental health resources and their willingness to engage in supportive behaviors towards peers experiencing mental health challenges. Complementing the quantitative findings, qualitative data will be collected through in-depth interviews or focus group discussions with a subset of participants. This qualitative inquiry will delve deeper into students' experiences with social media campaigns related to mental health, exploring the specific content, platforms, and messaging strategies that resonate most with them. Moreover, these qualitative insights will shed light on the perceived barriers and facilitators to engaging with mental health-related content on social media, as well as the potential unintended consequences of such campaigns. Through the synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data, this study seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the role that social media campaigns play in shaping mental health awareness among college students. Findings from this research will not only contribute to the academic literature on mental health promotion but also inform the development of more effective and culturally sensitive social media interventions aimed at supporting the mental well-being of college students."

L. de Moor, Yixin Tang, Mariëlle Osinga, Mariam Fishere, Moin Syed","Ethnic-racial identity (ERI) has been reported as mediator and moderator of the relation between discrimination and psychological well-being. However, it remains unclear how different forms of discrimination (i.e., overt and subtle) predict well-being over time, and whether ERI exploration and commitment mediate or moderate this association. This preregistered study explored the associations of overt and subtle discrimination with well-being (i.e., depression, substance use, life satisfaction) in a sample of 323 ethnic-racial minoritized college students (Mage W1 = 18.03, 62.7% female) from longitudinal data collected in the US. Cross-lagged panel models across three waves indicated no associations of overt discrimination, but participants experiencing more subtle discrimination during their transition to college reported more depressive symptoms after four months. ERI did not function as mediator or moderator. Findings indicate the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of ERI during emerging adulthood."

Using causal inference tools for observational studies, we aimed to estimate the total putative causal effects of the most relevant factors for persistent and severe PTSD in Syrian refugee children living in Informal Tented Settlements (ITS) in Lebanon. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of Syrian refugee families living in ITS in Lebanon (BIOPATH study) was analysed. Families with children aged 8-16 years that had left Syria less than 4 years prior to recruitment were included. The first wave was conducted between October 2017 and January 2018. Follow-up data collection was conducted one year later (51.55 +/- 1.84 weeks). A subsample of 134 children was assessed with a structured clinical interview six months after the follow-up (27.02 +/- 7.16 weeks), between December 2018 and August 2019. Of the 2282 families approached in 77 selected settlements, 1600 (70.1%) agreed to participate. After one year, 1438 families were approached and data collected from 1009 families (62.8% re-participation rate). Data from 9 families were excluded during data cleaning. Ninety-eight variables across multiple domains (demographic, psychological, familial and community level) were measured using validated questionnaires and considered for a systematic causal discovery and inference method. Increased risk for severe and persistent PTSD based on symptom score was the primary outcome of interest. This outcome was validated a posteriori through structured clinical interviews in a subsample.

Less attention has been devoted to count responses. A recent growth in interest in count item response models (CIRM)---perhaps sparked by increased occurrence of psychometric count data, e.g., in the form of process data, clinical symptom frequency, number of ideas or errors in cognitive ability assessment---has focused on unidimensional models. A few recently proposed unidimensional CIRMs rely on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution as the conditional response distribution which allows to model conditionally over-, under-, and equidispersed responses. In this article, we generalize one of those CIRMs to the multidimensional case, introducing the Multidimensional Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Model (M2PCMPM) class. Using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop marginal maximum likelihood estimation methods, primarily for exploratory M2PCMPMs. The resulting discrimination matrices are rotationally indeterminate. We pursue the goal of obtaining a simple structure for them by (1) rotating and (2) regularizing the discrimination matrix. Recent IRT research has successfully used regularization of the discrimination matrix to obtain a simple structure (i.e., a sparse solution) for dichotomous and polytomous data. We develop an EM algorithm with lasso ($\ell_1$) regularization for the M2PCMPM and compare (1) and (2) in a simulation study. We illustrate the proposed model with an empirical example using intelligence test data."

Especially children are known for their drive to explore and learn, which is crucial for developing in and navigating through our complex world. Naturally, some children may be more curious than others, leading to differences in how they structure their own learning experiences, subsequently impacting their developmental trajectories. However, there is a gap in the research field for a reliable measure of such differences early in development. Across three studies, we present the development and assessment of the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ), the first caregiver report measure to fill this gap. Items cover observable exploration behaviours in 5- to 24-month-olds to capture general tendencies of their desire to actively explore their immediate surroundings and are evaluated on a 7-point Likert-scale. Exploratory factor analyses and structural equation modelling on a sample of N = 370 UK caregivers led to the final selection of 23 items and provided evidence that the scale is unidimensional enough to allow for an overall curiosity score, whereas three emergent sub-factors of exploration types (sensory, investigative, and social exploration) showed acceptable internal consistency explaining additional variance in the data. Furthermore, the scale had good test-retest reliability after 7 to 14 days (N = 67) and related to the child’s temperament (N = 75; positively with surgency and effortful control, negatively with negative affect) offering evidence of its validity as a trait measure. Together, these results strongly support the scale’s reliability and validity, showcasing the ITCQ as a powerful tool for developmental research."

On the basis of the behavior in the last round and the group affiliation of the partner, each individual selects to cooperate, defect, or stop interactions and search for a different partner. The results of simulation demonstrated that agents adopt cooperative strategies, including tit-for-tat and out-for-tat, toward in-group members. By contrast, agents stop interactions immediately after pair formation without observing their partner's behavior when they are paired with an out-group individual.

Methods We analyzed data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child cohort study (MoBa), N=78,307. Mothers reported a lifetime history of depression during the second trimester of pregnancy, and current symptoms of depression during the third trimester using the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist short version (SCL-8). At six months postpartum, mothers self-reported breastfeeding initiation, maintenance, and difficulties.  Results Using binary logistic regression analyses, we report that a lifetime history of depression is associated with a lower likelihood of breastfeeding initiation (OR=0.751, 95%CI=0.650-0.938), breastfeeding maintenance (OR=0.712, 95%CI=0.669-0.785), and a greater likelihood of breastfeeding difficulties (OR=1.86, 95%CI=1.72-2.06).

Here, we plan to systematically examine the diversity and representativeness of big team science by comparing big team science to (1) traditional psychological studies and (2) its target population (the world population or a specific population). Specifically, we will compare the demographics of participants and authors from big team science to the other two sources. In addition, we will examine how socioeconomic/cultural factors might contribute to the presence of researchers and participants in big team science and traditional psychological research in a country/region."

We tasked one of the currently available ChatGPT-4-turbo-preview models from OpenAI with a qualitative coding assignment, which involved identifying elements related to a specific theoretical-analytical framework within 39 scientific empirical papers. We evaluated the quality of LLM-generated outcomes by comparing them with results generated through traditional human coding. In the process, we outlined the capabilities and advantages of using LLMs for systematic literature reviews, including practical considerations for their implementation. Our analyses showed that the LLM produced results that aligned closely with those obtained through traditional human coding. Furthermore, our experience indicated that incorporating LLMs into our research workflow was time- and cost-effective. Our results suggest that researchers and LLMs can work synergistically, improving efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and quality of the systematic literature review process.

Offering interim, brief interventions for distressed treatment-seekers can improve care access and mitigate adverse effects of long waiting times. This study proposes to test the efficacy of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), a strengths-based, goal-directed intervention, for psychological distress in help-seeking adolescents and young adults.  Methods: We will conduct a fully-powered, randomised, single-centre, two-armed, parallel, superiority, controlled trial. From September 2023 to March 2025, the study will recruit 124 participants (ages 16-30) presenting at a national youth mental health service in Singapore (CHAT, Centre of Excellence for Youth Mental Health) with clinically-assessed non-specific psychological distress, subthreshold or prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of a mood disorder. Participants will be excluded if they have high suicidal risk, psychosis, cognitive impairments, or current psychological treatments. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive six-session, case manager-delivered SFBT or treatment as usual (TAU), case management. Participants receiving SFBT are hypothesized to have greater improvements in self-reported psychological distress, from baseline to eight weeks, compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes are self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment. The study will additionally explore if SFBT is associated with: 1) increased self-efficacy and decreased hopelessness; 2) decreased downstream referrals at post-intervention; and 3) sustained clinical gains at three months post-intervention, compared to TAU.   Significance: Results have implications for expanding capacity of mental health services and enhancing capabilities of frontline case managers to provide timely and low-intensity evidence-based interventions to improve the mental health of young persons in Singapore."

Decades of research on hindsight bias suggest that people are poor at appreciating how they would behave when ignorant. In stark contrast, here we discover a remarkable capacity to simulate decision-making under a counterfactual knowledge state, by comparing real and ‘pretend’ play in two large-scale gamified experiments. Subjects saw the full solution to a game (e.g., all ship locations in Battleship, or the hidden word in Hangman) but then attempted to play as though they didn’t have this information. Impressively, they mimicked broad and subtle patterns of ordinary play, completely convincing peers of their ignorance. Nevertheless, computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in their decisions, consistent with a schematic simulation of their minds.

One manifestation of this is the rich pattern of semantic similarity effects found in immediate serial recall tasks. These effects differ from the effects of similarity on other dimensions (e.g., phonological similarity), which renders them difficult to explain. We propose a comprehensive mechanistic explanation of semantic similarity effects by extending a standard connectionist architecture for modeling immediate serial recall to incorporate semantic representations. Central to our proposal is the selective encoding of categorical features shared among multiple list-items. The selective encoding of shared semantic features is made possible via a tagging mechanism that enables the model to encode shared feature retrospectively. Through this category-encoding mechanism, our model accounts for the majority of semantic similarity effects. Our results imply that working memory represents semantic information in a more restricted way than phonological information."

It is unknown whether early screen media exposure exacerbates the association between infant regulatory problems and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Methods: We studied 10,170 individuals from the Growing Up in Ireland ’08 cohort. Parents reported on their children’s regulatory problems at 9 months, screen media exposure at 3 years, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. Children were categorized based on their patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms using parallel process latent class growth analysis. Subsequently, multinominal logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate whether screen media exposure (&gt;1 hour or &gt;2 hours) moderated the association between regulatory problems in infancy and co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptom classes across childhood.  Results: There were four groups of children with distinct patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms: 1) low stable internalizing and low decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 6236; 61.3%); 2) low stable internalizing and moderate stable externalizing symptoms (N= 2029; 20%); 3) moderate increasing internalizing and moderate decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 1263; 12.4%); 4) moderate increasing internalizing and high increasing externalizing symptoms (N= 642; 6.3%). Presence of regulatory problems at 9 months and excessive screen media exposure at 3 years (particularly &gt;2 hours) were independently associated with increased likelihood of all classes. Excessive screen media exposure at 3 years did not significantly moderate the association between regulatory problems at 9 months and internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Conclusions: Both regulatory problems in infancy and screen media exposure &gt;2 hours in early childhood are early risk factors for the development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, the association between infant regulatory problems and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptoms appears to operate independently of excessive screen media exposure. Clinicians should be aware of, and treat, regulatory problems in infancy to prevent chronic patterns of self-regulatory problems across childhood. Further, they should discuss and advocate for family media plans with parents to help decrease the long-term negative effects on internalizing and externalizing symptoms."

One open question is which facial features observers use to recognize the different expressions and whether the features indicated by observers can be used to predict which expression they saw. We created fine-grained maps of diagnostic facial features by asking participants to use mouse clicks to highlight those parts of a face that they deem useful for recognizing its expression. We tested how well the resulting maps align with models of emotion expressions (based on Action Units) and how the maps relate to the accuracy with which observers recognize full or partly masked faces. As expected, observers focused on the eyes and mouth regions in all faces. However, each expression deviated from this global pattern in a unique way, allowing to create maps of diagnostic face regions. Action Units considered most important for expressing an emotion were highlighted most often, indicating their psychological validity. The maps of facial features also allowed to correctly predict which expression a participant had seen, with above-chance accuracies for all expressions. For happiness, fear and anger, the face half which was highlighted the most was also the half whose visibility led to higher recognition accuracies.  The results suggest that diagnostic facial features are distributed in unique patterns for each expression, which observers seem to intuitively extract and use when categorizing facial displays of emotion."

We synthesize insights from Buddhist literature and empirical research, investigating the relationship between these ‘nothingness’ phenomena, their transformative effects, and neural correlates. We also examine multiple pathways that may lead to cessation and consider potential cognitive models underlying these experiences using the active inference framework. Finally, we discuss the relationship between ‘nothingness’ events and cessation of suffering and enduring equanimity, setting the stage for further development in this field. Our unique contributions involve juxtaposing various experiences of “void, oneness, non-dual awareness, pure consciousness” with insights into “emptiness and cessation”, and analyzing their potential implications for alleviating suffering."

Considering the evolution of the vertebrate brain illustrates how brain function must always be considered in the context of the goal-directed activity of the individual. The brain does not simply mediate between stimulus and response but is instead part of a reafferent loop that begins and ends with the activity of the organism.

In particular, if new teams are formed, e.g., in a company, they would benefit if (a) each team member can apply as many of his/her strengths as possible in the company and (b) the team members can cooperate and combine as many of their strengths as possible. Discovering such human resource potential in a company is a crucial creative task. Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that divergent thinking is associated with higher functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, psychological methods to improve awareness and regulation of neurocognitive processes involved in creativity (i.e., metacognition of creativity) and thereby boost such functional connections remain elusive.Based on neuropsychological findings from creativity research, we propose a metacognitive training for promoting creativity called intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA). In a role-play, participants were divided into two groups. Each group was tasked with finding out how to apply their strengths beneficially in a company (for example, a psychiatric clinic). The fluency and originality of their ideas were measured as dependent variables of creativity. In the experimental group, the proposed intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA) method was carried out, while the control group was supposed to solve the task using the common brainstorming method. The results show that IICA led to significantly higher fluency and originality rates than the control group. These data suggest that IICA can be a promising metacognitive method to promote team creativity and cooperation potential. Future studies should validate the effect of this method in further companies and investigate the neurobiological foundations of our approach using neurophysiological methods and computational modeling."

However, these encounters are frequently conflated and remain undifferentiated. Here we address this ambiguity and provide a nuanced understanding of two such events: 1) emptiness (lack of inherent existence in experience, i.e., no-thingness) and 2) cessation (‘cut’ or absence in the stream of consciousness, i.e., nothingness). We synthesize insights from Buddhist literature and empirical research, investigating the relationship between these ‘nothingness’ phenomena, their transformative effects, and neural correlates. We also examine multiple pathways that may lead to cessation and consider potential cognitive models underlying these experiences using the active inference framework. Finally, we discuss the relationship between ‘nothingness’ events and cessation of suffering and enduring equanimity, setting the stage for further development in this field. Our unique contributions involve juxtaposing various experiences of “void, oneness, non-dual awareness, pure consciousness” with insights into “emptiness and cessation”, and analyzing their potential implications for alleviating suffering."

In adults, a new series of experiments has shown that intrinsic reward signals accompany successful word learning from context. In addition, this experience of reward facilitated long-term memory for words. In adolescence, developmental changes are seen in both reward and motivation systems, as well as in reading and language systems. Here, in the face of this developmental change, we ask whether adolescents experience reward from word learning, and how the reward and memory benefit seen in adults is modulated by age. We used a naturalistic reading paradigm, which involved extracting novel word meanings from sentence context without the need for explicit feedback. By exploring ratings of enjoyment during the learning phase, as well as recognition memory for words a day later, we assessed whether adolescents show the same reward and learning patterns as adults. We tested 345 children between the ages of 10-18 (N&gt;84 in each 2-year age-band) using this paradigm. We found evidence for our first prediction: children aged 10-18 report greater enjoyment for successful word learning. However, we did not find evidence for age-related change in this developmental period, or memory benefits. This work gives us greater insight into the process of language acquisition and sets the stage for further investigations of intrinsic reward in typical and atypical development."

However, established measurement tools are infrequently used to, i) assess children’s mathematical skills and ii) identify children with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. In response, this pre-registered systematic review aimed to provide an overview of measurement tools that have been evaluated for their psychometric properties for measuring the mathematical skills of children aged 0-8 years. The reliability and validity evidence reported for the identified measurement tools were then synthesised, including in relation to common acceptability thresholds. Overall, 37 mathematical assessments and 22 screeners were identified. In addressing the first aim, most measurement tools were categorised as child-direct measures delivered individually with a trained assessor in a paper-based format. In addressing the second aim, the synthesis revealed four key findings. First, the majority of the identified measurement tools have not been evaluated for all aspects of reliability and validity, and only seven measurement tools met the common acceptability thresholds for more than two areas of psychometric evidence. Second, only three screeners demonstrated an acceptable ability to distinguish between typically developing children and those with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. Third, although five mathematical assessments and six screeners included evaluations of predictive validity, none met the common acceptability threshold. Finally, only eight mathematical assessments and one screener were found to align with external measurement tools. Building on this current evidence and improving measurement quality is vital for raising methodological standards in mathematical learning and development research."

This paper delves intothemultifaceted landscape of gamified interventions within healthcare practice, aiming to provideacomprehensive evaluation of their efficacy, design principles, and potential impact on patient outcomes. Drawing upon a systematic review of empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, this paper examines the diverse applications of gamification across various healthcare domains, including chronic disease management, mental health support, physical rehabilitation, andhealth promotion. The analysis highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms throughwhich gamified interventions influence patient behavior and health-related outcomes. Byincorporating elements such as goal-setting, feedback mechanisms, social interaction, andreward systems, gamification seeks to enhance intrinsic motivation, foster behavior change, andimprove treatment adherence among individuals with diverse healthcare needs.Furthermore, this review explores the role of design principles and game mechanics in shaping the user experience and effectiveness of gamified interventions. It investigates how factors suchas narrative immersion, progress tracking, challenge levels, and personalization contribute totheengagement and sustained participation of users in health-promoting activities. While acknowledging the potential benefits of gamification in healthcare, this paper alsocritically examines its limitations and challenges. These include concerns regarding long-termengagement, user autonomy, privacy, and the potential for unintended consequences suchas addiction or disengagement from real-world activities. In conclusion, this review synthesizes the current evidence base on gamified interventions inhealthcare practice, offering insights into their potential impact, design considerations, andareas for future research and development. By fostering a deeper understanding of thedynamics between gamification and health behavior change, this paper aims to informthedesign and implementation of more effective and sustainable interventions to improve healthoutcomes and patient experiences."

However, there is no overarching framework organizing different parameterizations and a relatively small number of simulation-based or empirical examples testing or comparing these parameterizations. Thus, this tutorial paper has three main goals. First, we provide an overview of six parameterizations of individual participant meta-analysis, which we organize into a taxonomy based on different features of each parameterization (e.g., sample-specific parameters, meta-analytic parameters, number of models required). Second, using empirical data from 26,205 participants across 11 longitudinal studies, we provide a tutorial estimating each parameterization by investigating prospective meta-analytic and sample-specific associations between the Big Five personality traits and crystallized abilities along with four moderators of these associations. Finally, we compare convergence and divergence of findings across methods. We found that Openness is a robust predictor of crystallized abilities across samples and methods and that there were few moderators of personality trait-crystallized ability associations. Across methods, we largely see convergence in model estimates, with some exceptions. We conclude by making recommendations and providing a flow chart for choosing the most appropriate parameterization of data synthesis given a particular team’s research goals, questions, data availability, and model features."

In this paper, I consider findings from infant psychology and propose that our representations of social relationships are intuitive theories built on core knowledge. I propose three central components of this intuitive theory. The purpose of the first component is to recognize whether a relationship exists, the purpose of the second is to characterize the relationship by categorizing it into a model (i.e., type, schema, concept) and to compute its strength (i.e., intensity, pull, or thickness), and the purpose of the third is to understand how to change relationships through explicit or implicit communication. I propose that infants possess core knowledge on which this intuitive theory is built. This paper focuses on evidence for core knowledge that supports the second component on which the intuitive theory hinges—characterizing relationships. Following Relational Models Theory (A. P. Fiske, 1991, 2004), I propose that humans recognize relationships that belong to three models: communal sharing (where people see themselves as one), authority ranking (where people see themselves as ranked), and equality matching (where people see themselves as separate and track reciprocity). A single relationship can be organized according to any of these models depending on the context, but relationships tend to use one governing model. I further propose that humans recognize a relationship’s strength which can be thought of as a continuous representation of obligations (the extent to which certain actions are expected and morally evaluated), and commitment (the likelihood that people will continue the relationship). In communal sharing relationships, this may be felt as attachment, in authority ranking relationships it may be felt as allegiance or loyalty, and in equality matching relationships it may be felt as trust. One hypothesis regarding strength is that the stronger a connection, the less interchangeable the people. These representations, and the assumption that others share them, allow us to form, maintain, and change social relationships throughout our lives by informing how we interpret and evaluate the actions of others and plan our own."

In simulations across multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the model performs the task of category verification at a level comparable to human participants, and – critically – that its operation naturally gives rise to the basic-level-advantage phenomenon. That is, concepts are easier to categorise when there is a high degree of overlap in sensorimotor experience and/or linguistic distributional knowledge between category and member concepts, and the basic-level advantage emerges as an overall behavioural artefact of this linguistic and sensorimotor overlap.

Byincorporating elements such as goal-setting, feedback mechanisms, social interaction, andreward systems, gamification seeks to enhance intrinsic motivation, foster behavior change, andimprove treatment adherence among individuals with diverse healthcare needs.Furthermore, this review explores the role of design principles and game mechanics in shaping the user experience and effectiveness of gamified interventions. It investigates how factors suchas narrative immersion, progress tracking, challenge levels, and personalization contribute totheengagement and sustained participation of users in health-promoting activities. While acknowledging the potential benefits of gamification in healthcare, this paper alsocritically examines its limitations and challenges. These include concerns regarding long-termengagement, user autonomy, privacy, and the potential for unintended consequences suchas addiction or disengagement from real-world activities. In conclusion, this review synthesizes the current evidence base on gamified interventions inhealthcare practice, offering insights into their potential impact, design considerations, andareas for future research and development. By fostering a deeper understanding of thedynamics between gamification and health behavior change, this paper aims to informthedesign and implementation of more effective and sustainable interventions to improve healthoutcomes and patient experiences."

Barnes, Bryan James, Richard Lipton, Mindy Katz, Linda Hassing, Martijn Huisman","As more data is shared and concerns over the replicability, reproducibility, and generalizability of psychological and other social sciences continue, more researchers aim to conduct multi-study or multi-sample research and synthesize findings via data synthesis, using different parameterizations of individual participant meta-analysis. However, there is no overarching framework organizing different parameterizations and a relatively small number of simulation-based or empirical examples testing or comparing these parameterizations. Thus, this tutorial paper has three main goals. First, we provide an overview of six parameterizations of individual participant meta-analysis, which we organize into a taxonomy based on different features of each parameterization (e.g., sample-specific parameters, meta-analytic parameters, number of models required). Second, using empirical data from 26,205 participants across 11 longitudinal studies, we provide a tutorial estimating each parameterization by investigating prospective meta-analytic and sample-specific associations between the Big Five personality traits and crystallized abilities along with four moderators of these associations. Finally, we compare convergence and divergence of findings across methods. We found that Openness is a robust predictor of crystallized abilities across samples and methods and that there were few moderators of personality trait-crystallized ability associations. Across methods, we largely see convergence in model estimates, with some exceptions. We conclude by making recommendations and providing a flow chart for choosing the most appropriate parameterization of data synthesis given a particular team’s research goals, questions, data availability, and model features."

Y. Leung, Jo Van Herwegen","Successful early mathematical development is vital to children’s later education, employment, and wellbeing outcomes. However, established measurement tools are infrequently used to, i) assess children’s mathematical skills and ii) identify children with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. In response, this pre-registered systematic review aimed to provide an overview of measurement tools that have been evaluated for their psychometric properties for measuring the mathematical skills of children aged 0-8 years. The reliability and validity evidence reported for the identified measurement tools were then synthesised, including in relation to common acceptability thresholds. Overall, 37 mathematical assessments and 22 screeners were identified. In addressing the first aim, most measurement tools were categorised as child-direct measures delivered individually with a trained assessor in a paper-based format. In addressing the second aim, the synthesis revealed four key findings. First, the majority of the identified measurement tools have not been evaluated for all aspects of reliability and validity, and only seven measurement tools met the common acceptability thresholds for more than two areas of psychometric evidence. Second, only three screeners demonstrated an acceptable ability to distinguish between typically developing children and those with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. Third, although five mathematical assessments and six screeners included evaluations of predictive validity, none met the common acceptability threshold. Finally, only eight mathematical assessments and one screener were found to align with external measurement tools. Building on this current evidence and improving measurement quality is vital for raising methodological standards in mathematical learning and development research."

In adults, a new series of experiments has shown that intrinsic reward signals accompany successful word learning from context. In addition, this experience of reward facilitated long-term memory for words. In adolescence, developmental changes are seen in both reward and motivation systems, as well as in reading and language systems. Here, in the face of this developmental change, we ask whether adolescents experience reward from word learning, and how the reward and memory benefit seen in adults is modulated by age. We used a naturalistic reading paradigm, which involved extracting novel word meanings from sentence context without the need for explicit feedback. By exploring ratings of enjoyment during the learning phase, as well as recognition memory for words a day later, we assessed whether adolescents show the same reward and learning patterns as adults. We tested 345 children between the ages of 10-18 (N&gt;84 in each 2-year age-band) using this paradigm. We found evidence for our first prediction: children aged 10-18 report greater enjoyment for successful word learning. However, we did not find evidence for age-related change in this developmental period, or memory benefits. This work gives us greater insight into the process of language acquisition and sets the stage for further investigations of intrinsic reward in typical and atypical development."

Behavioral research has distinguished two types of “partisan lenses” - Policy-based and Affective – that may influence our perception of political events. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms through which partisanship operates within individuals. We addressed this question by collecting neuroimaging data while participants watched videos of speakers expressing partisan views. A “partisan lens effect” was identified as the difference in neural synchrony between each participant’s brain response and that of their partisan ingroup vs. outgroup. A policy-based partisanship lens effect was observed in socio-political reasoning and affective responding brain regions. An affective partisanship lens effect was observed in mentalizing and affective responding brain regions. These data suggest that policy-based and affective partisanship are supported by related but distinguishable neural and therefore psychological mechanisms, which may have implications for how we characterize partisanship and ameliorate its deleterious impacts."

Recent proliferation of online (web-based) research has generated a growing need for reliable open-access vocabulary tests that can be administered online. This data report presents the newly developed 30-item Web-based Open-access Reliable Decision on Synonyms (WORDS) English Vocabulary Test. In Experiment 1, we tested 109 participants (age range: 18-69 years) on an initial set of 51 potential multiple-choice test items in which participants read a target word (e.g., ubiquitous) and selected a (near-)synonym (e.g., omnipresent) from among three semantically unrelated foils (e.g., interpersonal, catatonic, voluminous). We conducted an item response theory analysis of participants’ accuracy data to select an optimal subset of 30 items to include in the final version of the test. In Experiment 2, we verified the reliability of this 30-item version in a different sample (N = 121; 18-79 years); reliability (internal consistency) was good (Cronbach’s α = 0.82). We confirmed that, consistent with numerous previous studies, (1) responses were more accurate and quicker for more frequent compared to less frequent words, and (2) older adults showed greater vocabulary knowledge compared to younger adults. The WORDS test takes on average 4 minutes (5 minutes 40 seconds including consent/debrief) to complete. It can be freely accessed via Gorilla Open Materials (https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/694887), allowing ease of use and for useful comparisons between data collected by different researchers."

However, children vary widely in the amount of time they spend reading, and those who struggle to read are often less motivated to spend their free time reading. Lack of reading experience then leads to impoverished vocabulary and language knowledge. To determine whether removing print as a barrier to accessing more complex language would improve children’s vocabulary and other language skills, we conducted a randomized controlled trial intervention (RCT) study in which children listened to audiobooks along with text, either alone or with scaffolded instructional support. Third and fourth-grade students (N = 314, age: mean(SD) = 9.47(.56) years) were randomly assigned to Audiobooks-Only, Audiobooks+Scaffold, or Mindfulness (active control group) for 8 weeks. The results showed significant improvements in receptive and expressive vocabulary for the two audiobook groups compared to the control group. The effectiveness of the intervention varied based on reading ability and socioeconomic status (SES); poor readers benefited only in the Audiobooks+Scaffold group, whereas children from lower-SES backgrounds improved with audiobook access alone, especially if they were already proficient readers. Additionally, the Audiobooks+Scaffold group listened to more audiobooks during the study. These findings suggest that text-supplemented audiobooks, particularly when combined with personalized support, can be a valuable tool for supporting vocabulary development in struggling readers."

However, many popular language models are cognitively implausible on multiple fronts. For language models to offer plausible insights into human cognitive processing, they should implement a transparent and cognitively-plausible learning mechanism, should train on a quantity of text that is achievable in a human lifetime of language exposure, and should not assume to represent all of word meaning. When care is taken to create plausible language models within these constraints, they can be a powerful tool in uncovering the nature and scope of how language shapes semantic knowledge. The distributional relationships between words, which humans represent in memory as linguistic distributional knowledge, allow people to represent and process semantic information flexibly, robustly, and efficiently."

Insights from the Hebb Paradigm,To be fetched,"Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain."

Clinical scientists have spent considerable resources designing and testing depression interventions. However, due to low access to treatment for depression (more than 50% of adolescents with depression symptoms never access treatment at all) and the heterogeneity of depression itself (a major depression diagnosis reflects &gt;1400 possible symptom combinations), none have led to meaningful declines in depression’s overall burdens for adolescents. Rates of depression appear to be increasing, potentially more rapidly in adolescents compared to older groups in the US. Status-quo approaches are unlikely to sustainably improve adolescent depression. We propose that a critical and often overlooked contributor to this shortfall is youth autonomy—a key, developmentally-aligned need for adolescents—to reduce rates of depression at the population level. During adolescence, individuals begin to separate from their parents, guardians, and caregivers (hereafter caregivers), and make decisions independently. This process is critical for healthy identity formation, self-efficacy, and mental health—including prevention and reduction of depression. Youth autonomy is among myriad multi-level factors relevant to depression trajectories. However, unlike many social and structural contributors to depression, youths’ perceived autonomy is relatively modifiable through individual-level intervention, making it a promising intervention target. The psychosocial importance of youth autonomy stands in sharp contrast to modern policies and structures which undermine youth independence and control—including within many existing depression interventions. We summarize how existing youth depression interventions and mental health systems may inadvertently undermine youth autonomy. We then suggest strategies for redesigning existing interventions and policies in ways that directly promote adolescent autonomy, and in turn, help reduce depression at scale."

However, motor learning involves both developing feedforward inverse internal models for planning motor trajectories and developing a capacity to correct erroneous trajectories in real-time via online feedback control. This latter motor-control perspective has not been well-studied in movement sonification research and it is not known whether motor learning improvements from movement sonification are driven by improved inverse internal models, corrective real-time adjustments, or both. We searched for evidence of real-time adjustments (muscle twitches) in response to movement sonification by comparing the kinematics of reaches made with online and terminal sonification feedback. We found that reaches made with online feedback were significantly more jerky than reaches made with terminal feedback, indicating increased muscle twitching. Using a between-subject design, we found that online feedback was associated with improved motor learning of a reach path and target over terminal feedback; however, using a within-subjects design, we found that switching participants who had learned with online sonification feedback to terminal feedback was associated with a decrease in error. Thus, our results suggest that, with our task and sonification, movement sonification leads to online motor adjustments which improve motor trajectory planning, but which themselves are not helpful online corrections."

Paul, Emily Falk, Emile Bruneau, Kevin Ochsner","Political partisanship is often conceived as a lens through which we view politics. Behavioral research has distinguished two types of “partisan lenses” - Policy-based and Affective – that may influence our perception of political events. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms through which partisanship operates within individuals. We addressed this question by collecting neuroimaging data while participants watched videos of speakers expressing partisan views. A “partisan lens effect” was identified as the difference in neural synchrony between each participant’s brain response and that of their partisan ingroup vs. outgroup. A policy-based partisanship lens effect was observed in socio-political reasoning and affective responding brain regions. An affective partisanship lens effect was observed in mentalizing and affective responding brain regions. These data suggest that policy-based and affective partisanship are supported by related but distinguishable neural and therefore psychological mechanisms, which may have implications for how we characterize partisanship and ameliorate its deleterious impacts."

Recent proliferation of online (web-based) research has generated a growing need for reliable open-access vocabulary tests that can be administered online. This data report presents the newly developed 30-item Web-based Open-access Reliable Decision on Synonyms (WORDS) English Vocabulary Test. In Experiment 1, we tested 109 participants (age range: 18-69 years) on an initial set of 51 potential multiple-choice test items in which participants read a target word (e.g., ubiquitous) and selected a (near-)synonym (e.g., omnipresent) from among three semantically unrelated foils (e.g., interpersonal, catatonic, voluminous). We conducted an item response theory analysis of participants’ accuracy data to select an optimal subset of 30 items to include in the final version of the test. In Experiment 2, we verified the reliability of this 30-item version in a different sample (N = 121; 18-79 years); reliability (internal consistency) was good (Cronbach’s α = 0.82). We confirmed that, consistent with numerous previous studies, (1) responses were more accurate and quicker for more frequent compared to less frequent words, and (2) older adults showed greater vocabulary knowledge compared to younger adults. The WORDS test takes on average 4 minutes (5 minutes 40 seconds including consent/debrief) to complete. It can be freely accessed via Gorilla Open Materials (https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/694887), allowing ease of use and for useful comparisons between data collected by different researchers."

In order to test the construct validity of the new instrument (Inventory of Secular/Spiritual Wakefulness; WAKE-16), we performed a comparison between a group of expert meditators (n = 36) and demographically matched non-meditators (n = 36). Results showed significantly higher scores for the meditators on the WAKE-16, indicating construct validity of the new instrument. Meditators scored higher on the two mindfulness subscales of ‘presence’ and ‘acceptance,’ as well as on the SEE subscales of emotion regulation and body-related symbolization of emotions. Within the group of meditators, there were significant correlations between wakefulness and mindfulness (r = .614, p &lt; .001), accepting one’s own emotions (r = .416, p = .012), and experiencing overwhelming emotions (r = -.424, p = .010). The only significant correlation in non-meditators was found between wakefulness and accepting one’s own emotions (r = .411, p = .008). The new instrument showed construct validity by discriminating between the two groups. Correlations between wakefulness and related psychological constructs indicate convergent validity. Future studies may attempt to increase discriminatory accuracy of the definition of wakefulness, as well as finding objective methods of measuring."

This attitudinal polarization is the basis for intergroup conflict and prevents societal progress in addressing pressing challenges. Research on attitude change should provide an answer regarding how people might be persuaded to move away from the extremes to take a moderate stance. However, persuasive communication often most strongly affects those who hold a moderate attitude or are undecided. More importantly, barely any research has explicitly aimed at mitigating extreme attitudes and behavioral tendencies. Addressing this gap, this article summarizes research demonstrating that (different types of) intraindividual conflicts might be a means to mitigate polarized attitudes. Goal conflicts, cognitive conflicts, counterfactual thinking, and paradoxical thinking facilitate cognitive flexibility. This, in turn, seems to initiate the consideration of alternative stances and, in turn, to mitigate polarization of attitudes. We discuss the limitations of the existing research and the potential of this approach for interventions."

We include annotations from all these domains and reveal a hierarchical organisation of discrete emotions by appraisal of valence and self-relevance. Furthermore, we apply predictive models to understand the contribution of emotion components to discrete emotions. We find that all 13 discrete emotions in our dataset can be significantly predicted as a function of emotion components. Our study contributes key insights using machine learning to the longstanding question of what is an emotion and underscores the centrality of appraisal in the generation of emotion. This has important implications on the complexity and function of emotion as an adaptive process."

Introduction: Children and adolescents with language and literacy difficulties are at elevated risk of mental health concerns compared to their peers. A body of research demonstrates the effectiveness of programs to support socioemotional wellbeing among typically developing young people. However, given the reliance on language-based skills to access ‘talking therapies’ (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), it is likely that interventions suited to the general population may be inaccessible for young people with language and literacy difficulties. As such, this scoping review aims to map the range of evidence in relation to interventions that support socioemotional wellbeing in young people with language and literacy difficulties. The review aims to identify gaps in the literature and guide future research.    Inclusion criteria: Studies will be included if they meet the following criteria: 1) The study includes participants aged up to and including 24 years with a diagnosed (or suspected diagnosis of) neurodevelopmental disorder impacting spoken and/or written language, and 2) the study reports on an intervention that targets (either directly or indirectly) the socioemotional wellbeing of those young people. Studies focusing on young people with acquired language or literacy difficulties will be excluded. This is because the nature of communication and/or socioemotional challenges among people with acquired conditions, and their subsequent needs for intervention, are likely to differ from those of young people experiencing language and literacy disorders that are developmental in nature.     Methods: A scoping review following the JBI guidelines will be conducted in March 2024 using search terms in English. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsychInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Central. Peer reviewed journal articles (primary studies) and dissertations/theses will be included.

Two independent reviewers will screen the identified studies in accordance with the eligibility criteria in two stages: 1) title and abstract screening, and 2) full text review. Any discrepancies in agreement will be resolved through discussion between the two reviewers, with a third reviewer to aid decision-making as needed. Data will be extracted from the included articles by two independent reviewers.    Results &amp; Conclusions: The findings will be presented as a narrative summary. The scoping review findings will provide readers with an overview of studies that have explored interventions for socioemotional wellbeing among young people with language and literacy difficulties. Gaps in the existing evidence base will be identified and findings will guide future research.

Doing so, however, is hard to practically accomplish due to an explosion in the scale of data required to weigh in on such breadth and diversity in robust and defensible ways. In this chapter, I elaborate the case for why empirical musicologist should pursue larger and more diverse datasets and how they might feasibly collect them via the methodology of web-based citizen science. Web-based citizen science also brings limitations and challenges, but in balance, I will argue that it is uniquely suited for studying musical phenomena at a large scale due to the intrinsically motivating nature of music to many people, unlocking the study of millions of people around the world, rather than tens of people from a local campus. With the larger and more diverse datsets it affords, web-based citizen science can play a valuable role in achieving more reproducible and generalizable findings in empirical musicology."

Theoretically, these effects may depend on at least two conditions. First, the multilingual and bidialectal characteristics; particularly, (second) language proficiency and the sociolinguistic context of language use (e.g., Green &amp; Abutalebi, 2013). Second, the EF aspects examined; specifically, recent accounts of the locus of the multilingual effect propose a general EF effect rather than an impact on specific processes (Bialystok, 2017). We compared 52 “monolingual” (with limited additional-language/dialect experience), 79 bidialectal, and 50 multilingual young adults in the diglossic context of Cyprus, where bidialectalism is widespread and Cypriot and Standard Greek are used in different everyday situations. Three EF processes were examined via seven tasks: inhibition, switching, working memory (Miyake et al., 2000). We found better multilingual and bidialectal performance in overall EF, an effect moderated by high (second) language proficiency."

To better understand the representational content and cognitive processes of PS and their relation to general semantics, we adapted a staple of General semantic memory research, the Property generation task. We randomly assigned 240 adult participants to a traditional General semantics perspective (e.g., listing the properties of families and bedrooms in general) or to a PS perspective (e.g., my family, my bedroom). Relative to the General semantics condition, the PS condition was associated with more features; these were more semantically distant from each other, and more frequently included adjectives, verbs, and prepositions and less frequently nouns. However, the two conditions had substantial (~46%) overlap in the frequency of their features. The findings contribute to the identification of the cognitive differences (e.g., semantic richness) and similarities (e.g., correspondence in semantic features) between personal and general semantic memory."

The experiment implemented a multiphase retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) design (with generation and memory assessment phases) in combination with the use of naming latency measures and the temporal analysis of interference featured in language production research. The generation phase, typically unanalyzed in the memory literature, examined generation time for category-stem completions as a function of ordinal positions of related items. There was strong cumulative interference in generation latencies in the first pass though the structured list, showing that memory is already affected in this phase. After a retention interval, accessibility of new items from previously activated categories and unactivated controls was assessed using continuous picture naming rather than aggregate memory measures. Crucially, there was a picture naming cost to previously activated (but not generated) category members relative to the control condition, a RIF effect. This cost was supervenient on new cumulative interference in the assessment phase, underlining the value of the combined methodology. The findings add important detailing to the processes underlying retrieval-induced costs in memory research while also showing that retrieval-induced semantic interference transfers from stem-completion to picture naming retrieval tasks. This format-independence is consistent with a conceptual basis of semantic interference but does not preclude a locus of adaptive learning in conceptual-lexical links. Overall, we show that the memory and language production fields are indeed different but complementary perspectives on the same semantic interference phenomenon.

This potential change would be considered a type of Hawthorne effect, in which participants alter their behavior in response to being watched, and could potentially compromise the outcomes and conclusions of experimental studies that use eye tracking.  We examined whether eye-tracking produced Hawthorne effects in six commonly used psychological scales and five behavioral tasks.  The dependent measures were selected because they are widely used and cited and because they involved measures of sensitive topics, including gambling behavior, racial bias, undesirable personality characteristics, or because they require working memory or executive attention resources, which might be affected by Hawthorne effects.  The only task where Hawthorne effects manifested was the mixed gambles task, in which participants accepted or rejected gambles involving a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing different monetary amounts.  Participants in the eye-tracking condition accepted fewer gambles that were low in expected value, and they also took longer to respond for these low-value gambles.  These results suggest that eye-tracking is not likely to produce Hawthorne effects in most common psychology laboratory tasks, except for those involving risky decisions where the probability of the outcomes from each choice are known."

Associations between temperament, emotional awareness, and emotion regulation strategies in youth",To be fetched,"Introduction: Emotion regulation (ER) is of utmost importance for emotional wellbeing. However, during early adolescence the use of adaptive ER strategies is challenging since the underlying cognitive systems for ER are still maturing. Furthermore, youth show large variation in ER strategy use as various child factors including temperament (i.e., Positive Emotionality (PE), Negative Emotionality (NE)) and emotional awareness (EA) contribute to the development of ER strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the way in which temperament, EA and ER strategies interact. We predicted temperament to contribute to the development of ER strategies whereby EA was associated with ER and moderated the association between (a) PE and adaptive ER strategies, and (b) NE and adaptive ER strategies in a facilitating way - and in a buffering way for the relationship between (c) PE and maladaptive ER strategies, and (d) NE and maladaptive ER strategies. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, the study included a community sample of adolescents (n = 220). Temperament was measured using the PANAS-C (Laurent et al., 1999) and EA was measured with the DERS (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). ER strategies were assessed using the FEEL-KJ (Braet et al., 2013). Results &amp; Conclusions:  Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed an interaction effect for NE and EA on maladaptive ER strategies. Yet, this moderating role of EA could not be described as buffering. The present findings suggest that the role of EA is complex in youth with temperamental vulnerability."

Moral identity is a construct at the intersection of moral development and identity formation. It is thought to be a source of moral motivation linking moral reasoning (our judgments about whether certain actions are right or wrong) to behavior (Hardy &amp; Carlo, 2011). Metacognitive regulation describes how people monitor and control their cognitive processes. For instance, when we realize that the strategy we use to solve a math problem is not working, we try another approach (Nelson &amp; Narens, 1990). In this study, three different dimensions that have been studied very little before are brought together and we sought an answer to the question of how metacognitive activity affects our decisions in moral dilemma scenarios. The study aims to measure the effect of metacognitive activity on morally-right decision-making in moral dilemmas. The first hypothesis of this study is ""If participants engage in moral metacognition before encountering moral dilemmas, their orientation towards truth increases”. A second hypothesis, in conjunction with the first one, is ""When people are faced with moral dilemmas, it is assumed that there is a negative relationship between the tendency of people with high and low moral identity scores to lie.” 34 individuals from Yeditepe University participated in the study. The data of the study were collected through Google forms and PsychoPy v2023.1.1. The experimental group was first asked to fill in the moral identity questionnaire, and then they were expected to fill out the moral metacognition questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire-filling process, the participants were subjected to 4 different moral dilemma scenarios while the control group answered the moral dilemma scenarios without completing the moral metacognition questionnaire. Statistical analyzes were made using JASP 0.17.0. According to the results, there are no significant differences between Moral Metacognition Activity and the tendency to tell the truth based on One-Way ANOVA. All three dimensions have a positive correlation, but the correlation between the Moral Metacognition score and the moral identity score is significant. Also, the correlation between Moral Metacognition and Total True Answer is significant too. When we analyzed the truth and lie tendency given to the scenarios, it has been shown that the interests of the individuals are more in the scenarios that concern and affect their own lives. Our results suggest that people are willing to lie for their own benefit."

The aims of the current study were to psychometrically validate the HSQ, identify latent factors, reduce the number of items within the HSQ, and explore the psychometric properties of longer and shorter versions of the scale. Methods A nationally representative sample of recent NHS hospital inpatients (N = 660; mean age = 54.0, range = 18–97) completed the HSQ within a survey of patient experiences; 32 of which completed the measure a second time two weeks later. Factor structure, convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive validity, and test-retest reliability were assessed. Results Seven domains of in-hospital stress were identified: quality of care, away from home, inconvenienced, health anxiety, negative effects of treatment, ward environment, and disrupted patient experience. Long (55 items), medium (28 items), and short (10 items) versions of the measure were produced, all exhibiting excellent psychometric properties. The highest rated stressor was “poor sleep”. Conclusion The HSQ is a valid and reliable tool, now available to be used by researchers and clinicians. It has potential to be used in intervention studies to reduce in-hospital stress, and to identify patients most at risk of the effects of post-hospital syndrome."

In this chapter, I elaborate the case for why empirical musicologist should pursue larger and more diverse datasets and how they might feasibly collect them via the methodology of web-based citizen science. Web-based citizen science also brings limitations and challenges, but in balance, I will argue that it is uniquely suited for studying musical phenomena at a large scale due to the intrinsically motivating nature of music to many people, unlocking the study of millions of people around the world, rather than tens of people from a local campus. With the larger and more diverse datsets it affords, web-based citizen science can play a valuable role in achieving more reproducible and generalizable findings in empirical musicology."

We randomly assigned 240 adult participants to a traditional General semantics perspective (e.g., listing the properties of families and bedrooms in general) or to a PS perspective (e.g., my family, my bedroom). Relative to the General semantics condition, the PS condition was associated with more features; these were more semantically distant from each other, and more frequently included adjectives, verbs, and prepositions and less frequently nouns.

Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant.

Evidence suggests that these hospital-related stressors negatively impact health: a phenomenon known as post-hospital syndrome. The current study aimed to identify hospital-related stressors, and to develop and provide initial validation for a new measure of in-hospital stress. Methods Measure development occurred in three stages: (i) semi-structured interviews, (ii) item generation, and (iii) pilot testing. Twenty-one patients were interviewed regarding their recent hospital experiences, and a list of hospital-related stressors was produced. These stressors were compiled into a questionnaire and piloted on 200 recent inpatients to provide initial evidence of internal consistency and construct validity. Results Stressors identified from the interviews captured all relevant questions from three previous hospital stress measures, plus 12 more. The most reported stressor was ‘poor sleep’. These hospital-related stressors were developed into 67 questions, forming the Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ). The HSQ showed excellent internal consistency and construct validity, and correlated with feelings of vulnerability and being unprepared to go home. Conclusion The HSQ is a promising self-report tool for measuring in-hospital stress. Future research ought to investigate its psychometric properties further in larger and more diverse samples. The measure has potential to be used to monitor patient risk of post-hospital syndrome."

Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience. On average, participants asserted their ability was 89 Elo rating points higher than their observed ratings indicated—expecting to outscore an equally-rated opponent by 2:1. One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated.

Intergroup exclusion elicited by RateME and interpersonal exclusion elicited by both RateME and Cyberball were independently associated with increased psychological distress and state hostility, regardless of participants’ degree of identification with the group.

In two studies with university students (N1 = 234; N2 = 890, representative sample), we examined relations of these components with regulatory effectiveness as a proximal and SWB as a distal MR outcome.

Here, we examine this issue systematically for multinomial processing tree (MPT) models, a popular class of cognitive models for categorical data. Specifically, we examine the robustness of MPT model parameter estimates that arise from two important decisions: the level of data aggregation (complete pooling, no pooling, or partial pooling) and the statistical framework (frequentist or Bayesian). These decisions span a multiverse of estimation methods. We synthesized the data from 13,956 participants (164 published data sets) with a meta-analytic strategy and analyzed the magnitude of divergence between estimation methods for the parameters of nine popular multinomial processing tree (MPT) models in psychology (e.g., process dissociation, source monitoring). We further examined moderators as potential sources of divergence. We found that the absolute divergence between estimation methods was small on average (&lt; .04; with MPT parameters ranging between 0 and 1); in some cases, however, divergence amounted to nearly the maximum possible range (.97). Divergence was partly explained by few moderators (e.g., the specific MPT model parameter, uncertainty in parameter estimation), but not by other plausible candidate moderators (e.g., parameter trade-offs, parameter correlations) or their interactions. Partial-pooling methods showed the smallest divergence within and across levels of pooling and thus seem to be an appropriate default method. Using MPT models as an example, we show how transparency and robustness can be increased in the field of cognitive modeling."

However, previous studies mainly focused on support from partner or general social support and neglected the roles of grandparents. Here, we examine whether a lack of grandparental support is related to increased risk of a diagnosis of perinatal depression. In addition, we examine whether poor grandparental support is related to more depressive symptoms in mothers with and without perinatal depression and whether perceived grandparental support buffers against parenting difficulties in mothers with perinatal depression. Methods: The sample was drawn from an Australian pregnancy cohort study and consisted of 725 women, including 230 women who met criteria for Major Depression. At 12 months postpartum, women reported on grandparental geographical proximity and hours of grandparental childcare support. Perceived grandparental support was assessed with the Postpartum Social Support Questionnaire and parenting difficulties and depressive symptoms with the Parenting Stress Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: Perceived grandparental support was related to fewer depressive symptoms among mothers with perinatal depression. In addition, higher levels of perceived grandparental support were related to lower parenting stress in mothers with and without perinatal depression. Limitations: Intergenerational conflicts and quality of grandparenting were not assessed. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that supportive grandparents may prevent the development of more severe perinatal depression in mothers experiencing perinatal mental health problems. Future studies should examine whether involving grandparents in treatment may add to the effectiveness of existing perinatal mental health interventions."

Chabris, Daniel J. Simons","Overconfidence is thought to be a fundamental cognitive bias, but it is typically studied in environments where people lack accurate information about their abilities. Tournament chess players receive objective, precise, and public feedback, so we conducted a preregistered survey experiment and replication to learn whether overconfidence persists in an environment that should diminish or eradicate it. Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience. On average, participants asserted their ability was 89 Elo rating points higher than their observed ratings indicated—expecting to outscore an equally-rated opponent by 2:1. One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated. These patterns emerged in every sociodemographic subgroup we considered. We conclude that overconfidence persists even in real-world information environments that should be inhospitable to it."

The few studies available point to an interplay between motivational and emotional processes within self-regulated learning and the importance of MR for outcomes beyond achievement. Prior MR research has mostly focused on frequency of strategy use, but recent findings advocate for conceptually broader approaches to self-regulation. We adopted a three-component approach to MR differentiating between frequency of strategy use, situation-specific fit, and application quality. In two studies with university students (N1 = 234; N2 = 890, representative sample), we examined relations of these components with regulatory effectiveness as a proximal and SWB as a distal MR outcome. All three MR components uniquely contributed to effectiveness and SWB. Effectiveness was also related to greater SWB. The findings have implications for revisiting MR theories and developing interventions promoting SWB."

However, most psychological research has focused on interpersonal rather than intergroup effects to understand the link between social exclusion and aggression. We compared the effects of intergroup and interpersonal using RateME, a new task designed to dissociate both types of exclusion, and Cyberball in a sample of 1200 UK residents. Intergroup exclusion elicited by RateME and interpersonal exclusion elicited by both RateME and Cyberball were independently associated with increased psychological distress and state hostility, regardless of participants’ degree of identification with the group. Exclusion of either type also increased collective narcissism, especially in participants who had experienced higher levels of psychological distress. Our work reveals similar detrimental psychological effects of intergroup exclusion compared to interpersonal exclusion, highlighting intergroup exclusion as a risk factor for mental health with potential implications for violent extremism."

Evidence suggests that these hospital-related stressors negatively impact health: a phenomenon known as post-hospital syndrome. The current study aimed to identify hospital-related stressors, and to develop and provide initial validation for a new measure of in-hospital stress. Methods Measure development occurred in three stages: (i) semi-structured interviews, (ii) item generation, and (iii) pilot testing. Twenty-one patients were interviewed regarding their recent hospital experiences, and a list of hospital-related stressors was produced. These stressors were compiled into a questionnaire and piloted on 200 recent inpatients to provide initial evidence of internal consistency and construct validity. Results Stressors identified from the interviews captured all relevant questions from three previous hospital stress measures, plus 12 more. The most reported stressor was ‘poor sleep’. These hospital-related stressors were developed into 67 questions, forming the Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ). The HSQ showed excellent internal consistency and construct validity, and correlated with feelings of vulnerability and being unprepared to go home. Conclusion The HSQ is a promising self-report tool for measuring in-hospital stress. Future research ought to investigate its psychometric properties further in larger and more diverse samples. The measure has potential to be used to monitor patient risk of post-hospital syndrome."

Using a method described by Mõttus and colleagues (2023) we obtained noise- and bias-free ‘true’ correlations (rtrues), which were used to produce regression model estimates of the true independent associations (βtrues) of age, sex and Big Five personality domains with loneliness across three multicultural samples (Estonian-speaking, n = 20,893; Russian-speaking, n = 762; English-speaking, n = 600). Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant. Overall, we find that loneliness is far more closely related to Neuroticism than previously understood, and distinct from both social isolation and social disconnection."

However, research has shown that families maintain a preference for face-to-face assessments. We examined families' anxieties both before and after having an online assessment to determine whether any initial concerns are due to a lack of exposure and information surrounding online assessments, as opposed to the quality of the assessment itself. We also aimed to understand how referral services can help families choose an online autism assessment for their child.  Methods: 358 families with a child who received an online autism assessment through Healios rated their satisfaction with the service from the point of referral through to when they received the diagnostic outcome.  Results: Upon entering the online assessment service, families tended to worry about the quality they expected to receive. However, after exiting the service, families held significantly higher expectations about the quality of future online autism assessments. Furthermore, families were highly satisfied throughout the entire service, except for at the point of referral.  Conclusions: Our research shows families initially expect lower quality from online autism assessments, which is contrary to their high satisfaction levels upon completion. We emphasise the need for referral services to better educate families about the quality and the benefits of online autism assessments, and provide specific recommendations about what information families would like to receive to help ease their anxieties about their child receiving an online assessment."

Here, we used syntactically ambiguous sentences (“The man hit/chose the dog with the stick”) to explore the longevity of priming of syntactic structure. Some verbs provide a bias towards an instrument interpretation (the stick was used to hit the dog), whilst others are biased towards the modifier interpretation (the man chose the dog that possessed the stick). Experiment 1 revealed an effect of pre-existing verb bias on resolving syntactic ambiguities. In Experiment 2, we primed specific verbs towards their dispreferred interpretation in a study phase (e.g., hit was primed to the modifier interpretation). ~20 minutes later, the same verbs, along with unprimed verbs, were encountered in syntactically ambiguous contexts in a test phase. Exposure to the dispreferred interpretation in the study phase increased the preference for the same interpretation in the test phase, particularly for instrument-biased verbs. In Experiment 3, the study and test phases were separated by a ~12-hour interval that included sleep. No overall effect of exposure was found, but again a simple effect of priming was found for instrument-biased verbs. Our results suggest verb-bias priming is maintained over relatively long periods such as 20 minutes, and possibly as long as 12 hours, consistent with a contribution of episodic memory to maintenance of verb-specific syntactic biases."

All variables were measured continuously in a neurotypical, predominantly bidialectal and young-adult sample.  We found no evidence for an effect of autistic traits or of an interactive impact between autistic traits and bidialectalism/multilingualism on (second-dialect) vocabulary or fluid intelligence. Moreover, our results revealed a positive effect of second-dialect vocabulary proficiency on fluid intelligence. We interpret the latter finding as a relative, positive bidialectalism effect. However, future research should more carefully exclude alternative explanations of this effect which do not necessarily allude to a direct bidialectalism impact (e.g., that the effect may reflect a mediating, underlying ability factor that drives the development of language or any skill in general, including second-dialect/language proficiency). Additionally, our results suggest different effects of autistic traits in the general population compared to what is found in clinical ASD cases, with no detrimental impact on language and cognition in the former group. Finally, our findings suggest that autistic traits do not have a (larger) negative effect in bidialectals’ second and weaker language which is potentially more vulnerable to negative influences; and that bidialectalism/multilingualism effects do not differ (e.g., in the sense of a larger positive impact or exacerbated difficulties) as a function of degree of autistic traits (high versus low)."

The lingering effect refers to a phenomenon in which an initial misinterpretation persists in a final comprehension even after disambiguation, occurring after reading a garden-path sentence.  Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), we explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Consequently, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect while weakening the lingering effect. Additionally, the garden-path effect was affected by Surprisal, whereas the lingering effect was not. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects share a connection but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, while the lingering effect relates to short-term memory."

PD-1/PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint which involves the binding of PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) on a target cell to the PD-1 receptor (Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) on an immune cell. This immune checkpoint allows for the suppression and regulation of the immune system. Previous studies have shown that the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 allows for the activation of the immune cell and pro-inflammatory responses. However, in AD, chronic neuroinflammation has been strongly linked with the pathogenesis of the disease. The use of PD-1 inhibitors in AD is unorthodox, but not unfounded, since the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 can reduce local brain inflammation by the recruitment of immune cells for Aβ clearance, even if the immune cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors have been found to inhibit tauopathy and there is even potential in efficient combination therapies with NOD2. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis in neuroinflammation and AD is highly complex, and through this review, we aim to provide some insight into this relationship and explore the potential of it as an AD treatment."

To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences."

The lingering effect refers to a phenomenon in which an initial misinterpretation persists in a final comprehension even after disambiguation, occurring after reading a garden-path sentence.  Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), we explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Consequently, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect while weakening the lingering effect. Additionally, the garden-path effect was affected by Surprisal, whereas the lingering effect was not. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects share a connection but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, while the lingering effect relates to short-term memory."

To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences."

PD-1/PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint which involves the binding of PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) on a target cell to the PD-1 receptor (Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) on an immune cell. This immune checkpoint allows for the suppression and regulation of the immune system. Previous studies have shown that the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 allows for the activation of the immune cell and pro-inflammatory responses. However, in AD, chronic neuroinflammation has been strongly linked with the pathogenesis of the disease. The use of PD-1 inhibitors in AD is unorthodox, but not unfounded, since the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 can reduce local brain inflammation by the recruitment of immune cells for Aβ clearance, even if the immune cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors have been found to inhibit tauopathy and there is even potential in efficient combination therapies with NOD2. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis in neuroinflammation and AD is highly complex, and through this review, we aim to provide some insight into this relationship and explore the potential of it as an AD treatment."

However, the extent to which people are aware of this inequality remains unclear. This study examined perceptions of within-country carbon footprint inequality and their implications for climate policy support and the perceived fairness of actual carbon footprint inequality. We administered an online survey across four diverse countries – Denmark, India, Nigeria, and the United States (n = 4,003) – with 50% of participants sampled from the Top 10% income group. Our results reveal widespread underestimation of carbon footprint inequality, irrespective of participants’ country and income segment. We also find direct links between carbon footprint inequality perceptions and climate policy support and the perceived fairness of actual carbon footprint inequality but with significant variations observed across the four countries. These results underscore the urgent need to raise awareness about carbon footprint inequality and further unpack its implications for climate justice and policy."

All variables were measured continuously in a neurotypical, predominantly bidialectal and young-adult sample.  We found no evidence for an effect of autistic traits or of an interactive impact between autistic traits and bidialectalism/multilingualism on (second-dialect) vocabulary or fluid intelligence. Moreover, our results revealed a positive effect of second-dialect vocabulary proficiency on fluid intelligence. We interpret the latter finding as a relative, positive bidialectalism effect. However, future research should more carefully exclude alternative explanations of this effect which do not necessarily allude to a direct bidialectalism impact (e.g., that the effect may reflect a mediating, underlying ability factor that drives the development of language or any skill in general, including second-dialect/language proficiency). Additionally, our results suggest different effects of autistic traits in the general population compared to what is found in clinical ASD cases, with no detrimental impact on language and cognition in the former group. Finally, our findings suggest that autistic traits do not have a (larger) negative effect in bidialectals’ second and weaker language which is potentially more vulnerable to negative influences; and that bidialectalism/multilingualism effects do not differ (e.g., in the sense of a larger positive impact or exacerbated difficulties) as a function of degree of autistic traits (high versus low)."

Gareth Gaskell","Certain aspects of lexical knowledge can be primed by recent usage, with effects observed up to 24 hours later in some circumstances. Here, we used syntactically ambiguous sentences (“The man hit/chose the dog with the stick”) to explore the longevity of priming of syntactic structure. Some verbs provide a bias towards an instrument interpretation (the stick was used to hit the dog), whilst others are biased towards the modifier interpretation (the man chose the dog that possessed the stick). Experiment 1 revealed an effect of pre-existing verb bias on resolving syntactic ambiguities. In Experiment 2, we primed specific verbs towards their dispreferred interpretation in a study phase (e.g., hit was primed to the modifier interpretation). ~20 minutes later, the same verbs, along with unprimed verbs, were encountered in syntactically ambiguous contexts in a test phase. Exposure to the dispreferred interpretation in the study phase increased the preference for the same interpretation in the test phase, particularly for instrument-biased verbs. In Experiment 3, the study and test phases were separated by a ~12-hour interval that included sleep. No overall effect of exposure was found, but again a simple effect of priming was found for instrument-biased verbs. Our results suggest verb-bias priming is maintained over relatively long periods such as 20 minutes, and possibly as long as 12 hours, consistent with a contribution of episodic memory to maintenance of verb-specific syntactic biases."

However, research has shown that families maintain a preference for face-to-face assessments. We examined families' anxieties both before and after having an online assessment to determine whether any initial concerns are due to a lack of exposure and information surrounding online assessments, as opposed to the quality of the assessment itself. We also aimed to understand how referral services can help families choose an online autism assessment for their child.  Methods: 358 families with a child who received an online autism assessment through Healios rated their satisfaction with the service from the point of referral through to when they received the diagnostic outcome.  Results: Upon entering the online assessment service, families tended to worry about the quality they expected to receive. However, after exiting the service, families held significantly higher expectations about the quality of future online autism assessments. Furthermore, families were highly satisfied throughout the entire service, except for at the point of referral.  Conclusions: Our research shows families initially expect lower quality from online autism assessments, which is contrary to their high satisfaction levels upon completion. We emphasise the need for referral services to better educate families about the quality and the benefits of online autism assessments, and provide specific recommendations about what information families would like to receive to help ease their anxieties about their child receiving an online assessment."

Here, we provide an empirical account of key user concerns and outline a number of critical discussions that need to take place to protect participants and help researchers to make use of the novel opportunities of digital data collection and field studies. Our primary contention is that we need to elicit public perceptions to devise more up-to-date guidelines for review boards whilst also allowing and encouraging researchers to arrive at more ethical individual study design choices themselves. We conclude by discussing how we can better strike a balance between meeting ethical guidelines and the concerns of social media users alongside maximizing scientific impact and credibility."

Functional MRI studies in adults have identified patterns of BOLD activation associated with self-regulation of personal goal pursuit, but to our knowledge there are no studies to using fMRI to examine BOLD responses to personal goals in adolescence. Using regulatory focus theory, which distinguishes between self-regulation modes of promotion and prevention, Detloff and colleagues (2020) observed both shared and unique regions of activation associated with idiographically assessed promotion vs. prevention goal priming, as well as variations in BOLD response depending on whether participants believed they were or were not making progress toward attaining the goal. We conducted a replication study using the identical procedures as Detloff et al. in a sample of 47 healthy adolescents. We observed significant overlap between adolescent and adult neural activation during promotion and prevention priming in regions associated with higher-order cognition such as the insula, thalamus, and the post-central gyrus. Nonetheless, adolescents also demonstrated unique neural activation in regions related to the processing of social stimuli, such as the temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, and the angular and supramarginal gyrus. The findings enrich and extend our understanding regarding the nature of personal goal pursuit and identity-related self-regulation during adolescence."

Their argument is based on an empirical investigation of the increase in precision to measure individual differences in change if studies are progressively extended by adding an extra measurement occasion after one unit of time (e.g., year) has passed. They concluded that two-time point models are inadequate to reliably model change at the individual level and that these models should focus on group-level effects. Here, we show that these limitations can be addressed by deconfounding the influence of study duration and the influence of adding an extra measurement occasion on precision to estimate individual differences in linear change. We use asymptotic results to gauge and compare precision of linear change models representing different study designs, and show that it is primarily the longer time span that increases precision, not the extra waves. Further, we show how the asymptotic results can be used to also consider irregularly spaced intervals as well as planned and unplanned missing data. In conclusion, we like to stress that true linear change can indeed be captured well with only two time points if careful study design planning is applied before running a study."

It is thought to depend on metacognitive assessment of the size of pertinent knowledge gaps. Prior research suggests that metacognitive retrieval experiences during unsuccessful memory recall play a role in assessing the size of knowledge gaps that induce states of curiosity. Specifically, it has been reported that feeling-of-knowing (FOK) experiences during unsuccessful recall are associated with an increased probability of subsequent information-seeking behaviour for what could not be recalled. Here, we sought further evidence for the proposed involvement of curiosity in this association by focusing on links between curiosity and reward that are integral to current theoretical models. Our experimental paradigm involved learning of novel face-name associations followed by a test phase to probe name recall and elicit graded ratings of FOK when unsuccessful. Subsequently, participants provided ratings of curiosity for unrecalled names (Experiment 1) or made information-seeking choices and offered ratings of satisfaction upon exposure to sought information (Experiment 2). Results showed, as predicted, that FOK are positively correlated with ratings of curiosity for information that could not be recalled. We also replicated previous findings demonstrating that FOK are positively correlated with the likelihood of subsequent information-seeking behaviour. Critically, the degree of satisfaction reported upon exposure to sought information was positively correlated with previously experienced FOK as well. These findings converge to support the idea that FOK experiences during unsuccessful recall induce states of curiosity and shape subsequent information-seeking behaviour through reward-based mechanisms."

University students may be particularly likely to experience climate anxiety and worry if, for example, exposed to distressing climate change content in their studies. In a pre-registered online mixed-methods study, we investigated climate anxiety, climate change-related emotions, thoughts, and views about their university’s role in climate change action among 869 students at a large UK university. Results showed that students generally experienced moderate climate anxiety intensity across different situations. Students also reported high levels of negative emotions, including sadness, helplessness, and powerlessness, and low optimism and indifference. Students also experienced moderate to high levels of negative climate change related thoughts, such as “The future is frightening”. As for their university’s role, many students wanted more climate change related teaching and mental health support for climate change impacts. On average, students endorsed the thought that their university was “Dismissing people’s distress” about climate change moderately, which correlated significantly with students’ situationally assessed climate anxiety intensity (r = .32, p &lt; .01) and general climate anxiety frequency (r = .30, p &lt; .01). These results demonstrate the serious negative impact of climate change on university students’ mental health.

Data was collected during the primary grades (year 1–3), which allowed us to test two aspects of the model: how much reading comprehension variance that can be accounted for by decoding and language comprehension across primary grades (nine test occasions in total), and how decoding and language comprehension contributes to reading comprehension at each test occasion (three test occasions per grade). By using a latent variable framework, our findings indicated that nearly all reading comprehension variance was accounted for by decoding and language comprehension across each test occasion. Both decoding and language comprehension contributed to reading comprehension at all grades. While decoding contributed the most to reading comprehension variance at the first test occasions (Grade 1), language comprehension became equally important in the middle of second grade. At the end of third grade, language comprehension outperformed decoding. This study shows that the Simple View of Reading model is highly usable for yet another semi-transparent language, which has practical implications for how to assess reading skills and, ultimately of how to inform reading instruction for beginner readers."

Using regulatory focus theory, which distinguishes between self-regulation modes of promotion and prevention, Detloff and colleagues (2020) observed both shared and unique regions of activation associated with idiographically assessed promotion vs. prevention goal priming, as well as variations in BOLD response depending on whether participants believed they were or were not making progress toward attaining the goal. We conducted a replication study using the identical procedures as Detloff et al. in a sample of 47 healthy adolescents. We observed significant overlap between adolescent and adult neural activation during promotion and prevention priming in regions associated with higher-order cognition such as the insula, thalamus, and the post-central gyrus. Nonetheless, adolescents also demonstrated unique neural activation in regions related to the processing of social stimuli, such as the temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, and the angular and supramarginal gyrus. The findings enrich and extend our understanding regarding the nature of personal goal pursuit and identity-related self-regulation during adolescence."

Burton, Michael Geers, Philipp Lorenz-Spreen","The growing use of social media field experiments demands a rethink of current research ethics in computational social science. Here, we provide an empirical account of key user concerns and outline a number of critical discussions that need to take place to protect participants and help researchers to make use of the novel opportunities of digital data collection and field studies. Our primary contention is that we need to elicit public perceptions to devise more up-to-date guidelines for review boards whilst also allowing and encouraging researchers to arrive at more ethical individual study design choices themselves. We conclude by discussing how we can better strike a balance between meeting ethical guidelines and the concerns of social media users alongside maximizing scientific impact and credibility."

Psychological archetypes of scientific workers with pronounced introversion are postulated for the first time: they are less communicative (loner scientists), have a greater percentage of single-authored publications than collaborative ones, show less attachment to the sense and rhythm of time (prolonged work on a topic), exhibit high immersion in the subject of scientific research, are conservative in the theme of scientific research, conduct the majority of scientific research independently, are less adaptive to the environment, are less loyal and receptive to established rules or regulations, and critically perceive secondary details unrelated to scientific research. The normative-legal framework in the field of science does not fully take into account the psychological characteristics of a scientific worker and scientific activity.

In the present study, we investigated the relative contributions of verbal skills vs. non-verbal, nonsymbolic number processing to 5th- and 6th- grade children’s fractions skills.  Specifically, we compared two mathematical verbal skills—transcoding and mathematics vocabulary—and two skills representing nonsymbolic analog magnitudes—approximate number sense acuity and acuity for processing non-symbolic ratios. To assess children’s symbolic fraction abilities, we used an experimental fraction arithmetic error detection task alongside a fraction magnitude comparison task, with fractions stimuli composed of two-digit components. Critically, mathematics vocabulary was the only predictor of interest that significantly predicted performance on both the error detection and comparison tasks.

We tested these claims using a combination of one-stage and univariate meta-analytic structural equation modeling with moderation (k = 238; n = 1,040, N = 126,423). In the univariate models, parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being (r = 0.30 [95% CI 0.26, 0.33]) whereas parental psychological control was positively linked with child ill-being (r = 0.26 [0.23, 0.28]). Consistent with SDT’s dual process model, the one-stage model that controls for the intercorrelations between predictors, showed that parental autonomy support and psychological control had unique and independent effects on child wellness outcomes. Parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being, even when accounting for psychological control (r = 0.26 [0.20, 0.31]), and psychological control was positively linked to child ill-being, independent of autonomy support (r = 0.20 [0.17, 0.23]). Crucially, the beneficial effects of parental autonomy support and the costs of psychological control applied across regions, degrees of national individualism and cultural hierarchy, as well as child developmental periods and sexes.

How do we decide when to reward collaborators, and are these decisions closely aligned with how responsible they were for the outcome of a collaboration? In Experiments 1a and 1b (𝑁 = 360), we tested how participants give bonuses, using stimuli and an experiment design that has previously been used to elicit responsibility judgments (Xiang et al., 2023a). Past work has found that responsibility judgments are driven both by how much effort people actually contributed and how much they could have contributed (Xiang et al., 2023a). In contrast, here we found that participants allocated bonuses based only on how much effort agents actually contributed. In Experiments 2a and 2b (𝑁 = 358), participants allocated bonuses to agents who were instructed to exert a particular level of effort; participants rewarded these agents more for complying with instructions, and their rewards were less sensitive to the precise level of effort exerted. Together, these findings suggest that people reward collaborators based on their willingness to exert effort, and point to a difference between decisions about how to assign responsibility to collaborators and how to incentivize them. One possible explanation for this difference is that responsibility judgments may reflect causal inference about past collaborations, whereas providing incentives may motivate collaborators to keep exerting effort in the future. Our work sheds light on how we understand and formalize the cognitive capacities that underlie collaboration."

However, according to active inference, such strict divisions cannot be invoked, since all cognitive and behavioural processes can be described as maximising the evidence for an agent’s generative model, which entails preferences that make an entity the thing it is. As such, attention — and perception more broadly — is constrained or enslaved by prior beliefs for which an agent must seek evidence. This paper demonstrates that this imperative is always at play in cognitive systems endowed with attentional schema, and that the preferences in question transcend the contingent, task-relevant goals that bias attention. Rather, attention is powerfully tuned by the most-deep rooted priors the agent possesses, such that, when sensory evidence against these priors is observed and free energy spikes, the agent attentionally prioritises the homeostatic restoration of these preferred states over their shorter-term desires. Thus, at its core, attention is a goal-driven process, which calls into question the putative distinction between endogenous – goal-directed, top-down – attention and exogenous – bottom-up, stimulus-driven, automatic – attention. What emerges in its place is a symbiotic relationship between attention and preferences, whereby the fulfilment of the latter rests on successful application of the former, and the former derives its function from the organismic need to confirm the latter."

Current AE reporting standards in PAT trials are poorly calibrated to features of PAT that distinguish it from other treatments, leaving many potential AEs unassessed. Methods: A multidisciplinary working group of experts involved in PAT pooled formally and informally documented AEs observed through research experience and in published literature. This information was integrated with (a) current standards and practices for AE reporting in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials, and (b) published findings documenting post-acute dosing impacts of psychedelics on subjective states, meaning, and psychosocial health variables, to produce a set of AE constructs important to evaluate in PAT as well as recommended methods and time frames for their assessment and monitoring. Correspondence between identified potential AEs and current standards for AE assessment was examined, including the extent of coverage of identified AE constructs by 22 existing measures used in relevant research.  Results: 53 potential AE terms warranting systematized assessment in PAT were identified, defined, and categorized. Existing measures demonstrated substantial gaps in their coverage of identified AE constructs. Recommendations were developed for how to assess PAT AEs (including patient, clinician, and informant reports), and when to assess over preparation, dosing session, integration, and follow-up.  Conclusions: This assessment framework addresses the need to capture post-acute dosing AEs in PAT, accounting for its pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy components, as well as documented impacts of psychedelics on worldviews and spirituality."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9anmr,2024-03-05,What’s in my cluster? Evaluating automated clustering methods to understand idiosyncratic search behavior in verbal fluency,To be fetched,"Individuals routinely search through memory for concepts. This behavior is commonly studied via the verbal fluency task (VFT), where participants are typically asked to generate as many exemplars as they can from a given category (e.g., animals) or letter label (e.g., F) within a fixed amount of time. Responses in the VFT tend to be clustered in meaningful ways but individuals widely differ in the manner in which they cluster items. Despite the development of several (hand-coded and automated) methods of defining clusters and switches in the VFT, there is currently no consensus on which scoring method provides the best mechanistic account of how individuals search through memory in the VFT. In this work, we provide an empirical evaluation of several automated methods for defining clusters and switches in the VFT by comparing model-predicted clusters with participant-designated clusters. We find that a method that combines gradual rises and drops in a weighted composite of semantic and phonological similarity best predicts participant-designated cluster-switch events across three domains (animals, foods, and occupations). Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to understand idiosyncratic search behavior by computing a measure of discordance for each pairwise transition based on a large dataset of cluster-switch designations from independent raters (N = 211) for the same transitions via a pre-registered experiment. We find that transitions with high idiosyncratic scores have low lexical content (i.e., semantic and phonological similarity), and an individual’s score on one domain is predictive of their score on another domain, suggesting that idiosyncratic scores may be capturing meaningful information about non-lexical sources and processes that contribute to memory search at the individual level."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kj5d3,2024-03-05,Aphantasia and alexithymia predict complex PTSD symptoms,To be fetched,"Aphantasia is characterised by a complete, or almost complete, absence of visual imagery. Prior work has hinted that these individuals may experience qualitative alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) in contrast to neurotypicals. However, higher levels of alexithymia (i.e., difficulties identifying one’s own emotions) and trauma exposure have been linked to PTSD and possibly aphantasia. We therefore wondered if aphantasia would be associated with the most widely used PTSD symptom measures (i.e., the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: PCL-5; and the International Trauma Questionnaire: ITQ) when alexithymia, trauma levels, sex at birth and age were considered. We replicated prior work in finding alexithymia positively predicts symptoms across all PTSD and complex PTSD measures, their subscales, and their related functional impairments. By contrast, aphantasia was not clearly linked to PTSD symptoms in global PCL-5 or ITQ scores, nor in any of the PCL-5 subscales. Despite this, aphantasia was associated with a reduction in the ITQ’s re-experiencing of traumatic events subscale, and an increase in complex PTSD symptoms, i.e., disturbances in self-organization and its related functional impairments, negative self-concepts, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.

This could be attributed to the observer’s general unfamiliarity with the dynamic characteristics of the movement after the inversion. A previous study showed that, compared to typical and non-dancers, vertical dancers were more sensitive to the artificial inversion of dance movements performed either in an upright or inverted orientation, when provided with dynamic information. This ability was attributed to vertical dancers’ unique visual and motor experience of performing movements upside down while hanging in the air. The current study aimed to replicate this finding and use eye-tracking data to identify the source of information that vertical dancers relied on to perform the judgment. Twenty dance movements were recorded either on the ground or in the air. Each pair of ground and air movements had similar forms to control the configural information. The movement was either presented as-is or inverted and the participants needed to determine whether the display was inverted. The results replicated the previous study and further showed that the higher sensitivity of vertical dancers in detecting the inverted movements was attributed to their longer and more frequent fixations on the lower torso area, where the harness was placed when performing the air movement. Although traditional dancers also attended to the lower torso area, their lack of experience with inverted movements limited their ability to interpret the observed motion for detection of the inversion."

Prior work has hinted that these individuals may experience qualitative alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) in contrast to neurotypicals. However, higher levels of alexithymia (i.e., difficulties identifying one’s own emotions) and trauma exposure have been linked to PTSD and possibly aphantasia. We therefore wondered if aphantasia would be associated with the most widely used PTSD symptom measures (i.e., the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: PCL-5; and the International Trauma Questionnaire: ITQ) when alexithymia, trauma levels, sex at birth and age were considered. We replicated prior work in finding alexithymia positively predicts symptoms across all PTSD and complex PTSD measures, their subscales, and their related functional impairments. By contrast, aphantasia was not clearly linked to PTSD symptoms in global PCL-5 or ITQ scores, nor in any of the PCL-5 subscales. Despite this, aphantasia was associated with a reduction in the ITQ’s re-experiencing of traumatic events subscale, and an increase in complex PTSD symptoms, i.e., disturbances in self-organization and its related functional impairments, negative self-concepts, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Given their elevated levels of complex PTSD symptoms, those with aphantasia may require greater support than is currently considered.

Lundin, Michael N. Jones","Individuals routinely search through memory for concepts. This behavior is commonly studied via the verbal fluency task (VFT), where participants are typically asked to generate as many exemplars as they can from a given category (e.g., animals) or letter label (e.g., F) within a fixed amount of time. Responses in the VFT tend to be clustered in meaningful ways but individuals widely differ in the manner in which they cluster items. Despite the development of several (hand-coded and automated) methods of defining clusters and switches in the VFT, there is currently no consensus on which scoring method provides the best mechanistic account of how individuals search through memory in the VFT. In this work, we provide an empirical evaluation of several automated methods for defining clusters and switches in the VFT by comparing model-predicted clusters with participant-designated clusters. We find that a method that combines gradual rises and drops in a weighted composite of semantic and phonological similarity best predicts participant-designated cluster-switch events across three domains (animals, foods, and occupations). Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to understand idiosyncratic search behavior by computing a measure of discordance for each pairwise transition based on a large dataset of cluster-switch designations from independent raters (N = 211) for the same transitions via a pre-registered experiment. We find that transitions with high idiosyncratic scores have low lexical content (i.e., semantic and phonological similarity), and an individual’s score on one domain is predictive of their score on another domain, suggesting that idiosyncratic scores may be capturing meaningful information about non-lexical sources and processes that contribute to memory search at the individual level."

Maples-Keller, Holly Frances Levin-Aspenson, Ali John Zarrabi, Caroline Peacock, Tajna Mletzko, Barbara O Rothbaum","Objective: Despite considerable research examining the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies (PATs) for treating psychiatric disorders, assessment of adverse events (AEs) in PAT research has lagged. Current AE reporting standards in PAT trials are poorly calibrated to features of PAT that distinguish it from other treatments, leaving many potential AEs unassessed. Methods: A multidisciplinary working group of experts involved in PAT pooled formally and informally documented AEs observed through research experience and in published literature. This information was integrated with (a) current standards and practices for AE reporting in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials, and (b) published findings documenting post-acute dosing impacts of psychedelics on subjective states, meaning, and psychosocial health variables, to produce a set of AE constructs important to evaluate in PAT as well as recommended methods and time frames for their assessment and monitoring. Correspondence between identified potential AEs and current standards for AE assessment was examined, including the extent of coverage of identified AE constructs by 22 existing measures used in relevant research.  Results: 53 potential AE terms warranting systematized assessment in PAT were identified, defined, and categorized. Existing measures demonstrated substantial gaps in their coverage of identified AE constructs. Recommendations were developed for how to assess PAT AEs (including patient, clinician, and informant reports), and when to assess over preparation, dosing session, integration, and follow-up.  Conclusions: This assessment framework addresses the need to capture post-acute dosing AEs in PAT, accounting for its pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy components, as well as documented impacts of psychedelics on worldviews and spirituality."

Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ve6ca,2024-03-05,Reduced Spatial Frequency Differentiation and Sex Differences in the Fusiform Cortex during Emotional Face Processing in Autism,To be fetched,"Background: Visual perception relies on predictive processes driven by low spatial frequencies that convey coarse information prior to fine information conveyed by high frequencies. Autistic individuals, however, favor local and fine information, conveyed by high spatial frequencies. This suggests that atypical predictive processes from low spatial frequencies may contribute to facial processing difficulties in autism. Nonetheless, since autistic females often present better socio-communicational abilities than males, we hypothesized that a more typical coarse-to-fine processing should be seen in autistic females than males for socioemotional stimuli. Method: To test this hypothesis, we asked adult participants (44 autistic, 51 non-autistic) to detect fearful faces among neutral faces, filtered in two orders: from coarse to fine (CtF) and from fine to coarse (FtC). Results: Results show lower d’ values and longer reaction times for fearful detection in autism compared to non-autistic individuals, irrespective of the filtering order. Both groups presented shorter P100 latency after CtF compared to FtC, and faster and larger amplitude for N170 after FtC compared to CtF. Nevertheless, autistic participants presented reduced differences between CtF and FtC in the fusiform, which was more spatially spread in autistic females compared to NA females. This suggests reduced spatial frequency differentiation in autism. Finally, females had faster P100 and N170, and larger occipital activation for FtC sequences than males, regardless of the group. Conclusions: The results do not suggest impaired predictive processes from LSF in autism despite behavioral differences in fear detection. Nonetheless, they indicate sex differences that need to be considered."

Here we re-assess the many studies on location probability learning that suggest that people can unconsciously learn to suppress salient but irrelevant distractors frequently presented in a certain location. In the additional singleton task, one of the arguments to support this claim is that suppression in search times does not significantly differ between “aware” and “unaware” participants. Although rarely acknowledged, this null interaction could also result if the data are contaminated by measurement and/or sampling noise. Unfortunately, the reliability of the awareness measure cannot be assessed with standard methods, since it is a single-trial test. In the present study we offer model-based estimations of measurement and sampling noise in empirical data. Our goal is to determine how often researchers would mistakenly conclude that learning is unconscious, given data from a model based on the opposite claim (i.e., that learning is conscious) but including noise in participants’ search times and awareness responses. To do so, we fitted this noisy conscious model to a public dataset involving 159 participants who performed the additional singleton task. Estimated parameters from this model were used, first, to predict the observed pattern of results and, second, to simulate new responses and participants. Results suggest that, under reasonable measurement noise and sample sizes, simulated evidence from the model can paradoxically but falsely support arguments used to defend the unconscious learning hypothesis. This study serves as an illustration to experimental psychologists of the risks of neglecting basic psychometric requirements in individual differences research."

This individualistic focus neglects the role of collective behavioral and emotional responses in mitigating disease spread. To address this, we introduce a two-layer framework of the BIS, consisting of an individual layer driven by disgust, primarily manifesting in avoidance behaviors and biased attitudes, and a collective layer fueled by collective anxiety, characterized by isolation from outgroups and self-protection within ingroups. Our model shows that inadequacies in the individual-level BIS stimulate the emergence of a collective-level BIS, which in turn has a buffering effect on individual behaviors. We further explore the impact of social relation attributes on the collective-level BIS, categorizing them into fixed and flowing types based on selectivity and expected endpoints, finding that flowing relations prompt collective BIS responses through cooperation, while fixed relations do so through intimate relationships. This enriched framework offers important implications for public health policies and opens avenues for cross-cultural and cross-societal research by acknowledging the reciprocal influences between individual and collective behaviors in response to pathogen threats."

Apports de la psychologie clinique et sociale à la question du leadership de  proximité à l’hôpital public,To be fetched,"Nous avançons dans cet article une contribution théorique originale croisant les apports de la psychologie clinique et de la psychologie sociale, afin de proposer une conceptualisation différente du leadership exercé par les cadres de santé à l’hôpital. Nos développements s’appuient sur un côtoiement au long cours de cadres de santé en formation ou en exercice, d’abord durant une enquête de terrain ethnographique avec entretiens semi-dirigés, puis grâce à plusieurs années de participation observante en tant qu’enseignants dans des formations en Instituts de Formation de Cadres de Santé. A partir de la question toujours plus sensible à l’hôpital de la prise en compte des difficultés propres aux cadres de santé, nous ouvrons dans un premier temps des pistes de compréhension des tensions psychiques que ces professionnels rencontrent. Tout d’abord, leur statut tiraillé entre identité soignante et identité managériale, et les injonctions parfois fortes à choisir entre les deux, peuvent amener les cadres à ressentir la nécessité d’être pour leurs équipes des « pivots » entre ces deux mondes. Si leur sentiment d’utilité sociale y gagne, la charge mentale afférente à ce rôle social qu’ils endossent augmente elle aussi, les équipes pouvant être tentées de déléguer des parties du travail collectif à la seule figure du cadre.

These thoughts have been associated with maternal anxiety and depression2. However, their association with infant mental wellbeing is little understood. Methods: 246 female participants (mean age = 32 years)who were pregnant during the first wave (May-Sep 2020) of the COVID-19 Risks Across the Lifespan study and who completed the final assessment (Oct 2021-April 2022) were included in the present analyses. Results: Maternal postpartum intrusions were significantly associated with maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as well as child negative affectivity. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the associations with both maternal and infant mental health remained significant after controlling for antenatal stress, antenatal depression and anxiety, and infant age; as well as maternal postpartum distress, depression, and anxiety for the infant negative affectivity analyses. Conclusion: These findings suggest that reducing postpartum intrusions is a clinical priority for paediatric and women’s mental health."

A partir de la question toujours plus sensible à l’hôpital de la prise en compte des difficultés propres aux cadres de santé, nous ouvrons dans un premier temps des pistes de compréhension des tensions psychiques que ces professionnels rencontrent. Tout d’abord, leur statut tiraillé entre identité soignante et identité managériale, et les injonctions parfois fortes à choisir entre les deux, peuvent amener les cadres à ressentir la nécessité d’être pour leurs équipes des « pivots » entre ces deux mondes.

This individualistic focus neglects the role of collective behavioral and emotional responses in mitigating disease spread. To address this, we introduce a two-layer framework of the BIS, consisting of an individual layer driven by disgust, primarily manifesting in avoidance behaviors and biased attitudes, and a collective layer fueled by collective anxiety, characterized by isolation from outgroups and self-protection within ingroups. Our model shows that inadequacies in the individual-level BIS stimulate the emergence of a collective-level BIS, which in turn has a buffering effect on individual behaviors. We further explore the impact of social relation attributes on the collective-level BIS, categorizing them into fixed and flowing types based on selectivity and expected endpoints, finding that flowing relations prompt collective BIS responses through cooperation, while fixed relations do so through intimate relationships. This enriched framework offers important implications for public health policies and opens avenues for cross-cultural and cross-societal research by acknowledging the reciprocal influences between individual and collective behaviors in response to pathogen threats."

Vadillo","Occasionally, experimental psychologists enter into the realm of psychometrics without being fully aware of the risks involved in the study of individual differences. Here we re-assess the many studies on location probability learning that suggest that people can unconsciously learn to suppress salient but irrelevant distractors frequently presented in a certain location. In the additional singleton task, one of the arguments to support this claim is that suppression in search times does not significantly differ between “aware” and “unaware” participants. Although rarely acknowledged, this null interaction could also result if the data are contaminated by measurement and/or sampling noise. Unfortunately, the reliability of the awareness measure cannot be assessed with standard methods, since it is a single-trial test. In the present study we offer model-based estimations of measurement and sampling noise in empirical data. Our goal is to determine how often researchers would mistakenly conclude that learning is unconscious, given data from a model based on the opposite claim (i.e., that learning is conscious) but including noise in participants’ search times and awareness responses. To do so, we fitted this noisy conscious model to a public dataset involving 159 participants who performed the additional singleton task. Estimated parameters from this model were used, first, to predict the observed pattern of results and, second, to simulate new responses and participants. Results suggest that, under reasonable measurement noise and sample sizes, simulated evidence from the model can paradoxically but falsely support arguments used to defend the unconscious learning hypothesis. This study serves as an illustration to experimental psychologists of the risks of neglecting basic psychometric requirements in individual differences research."

Klein, Constantin von Stackelberg, Esther K. Papies, Lawrence Barsalou","Climate change increasingly affects mental health and wellbeing. Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5jkfz,2024-03-05,On the Nature of Measurement,To be fetched,"Over time, the concept of measurement has come to be associated with precision, accuracy, objectivity, and overall trustworthiness. In this chapter we engage with the question of how educational measurement can be understood with respect to measurement more broadly, and if and how instances of educational measurement earn this claimed trustworthiness. In section 2 of the chapter, we trace some key historical developments that help to explain how the concepts and terminology of measurement came to be invoked in educational and psychological contexts. In section 3 we argue that irrespective of the field of application or disciplinary context, successful instances of measurement will always involve certain components that serve to justify its claimed trustworthiness. We introduce a TISM framework for understanding measurement with respect to four central components: Theory (T), Instrumentation (I), Scales &amp; Units (S), and Modeling (M). We illustrate and apply the TISM framework briefly to the physical science context of measuring temperature and then more extensively to the educational context of measuring reading comprehension. Although the central components of measurement are present in each context, there are unique challenges in education. In section 4 of the chapter, we take a closer look at three of these challenges that are likely to remain areas for discussion and debate in the future: (1) the meaning of validity and how this should inform measurement practices, (2) evolving conceptualizations of measurement error and uncertainty, and (3) the role of measuring scales and units in the evaluation of magnitudes."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zg27u,2024-03-04,Meta-Representations as Representations of Processes,To be fetched,"In this study, we explore how the notion of meta-representations in Higher-Order Theories (HOT) of consciousness can be implemented in computational models. HOT suggests that consciousness emerges from meta-representations, which are representations of first-order sensory representations. However, translating this abstract concept into a concrete computational model, such as those used in artificial intelligence, presents a theoretical challenge. For example, a simplistic interpretation of meta-representation as a representation of representation makes the notion rather trivial and ubiquitous. Here, we propose a refined interpretation of meta-representations. Contrary to the simplistic view of meta-representations as mere transformations of the first-order representational states or confidence estimates, we argue that meta-representations are representations of the processes that generate first-order representations. This presents a process-oriented view whereby meta-representations capture the qualitative aspect of how sensory information is transformed into first-order representations. To concretely illustrate and operationalize thus formulated notion of meta-representation, we constructed ""meta-networks"" designed to explicitly model meta-representations within deep learning architectures. Specifically, we constructed meta-networks by implementing autoencoders of first-order neural networks. In this architecture, the latent spaces embedding those first-order networks correspond to the meta-representations of first-order networks. By applying meta-networks to embed neural networks trained to encode visual and auditory datasets, we show that the meta-representations of first-order networks successfully capture the qualitative aspects of those networks by separating the visual and auditory networks in the meta-representation space. We argue that such meta-representations would be useful for quantitatively compare and contrast the qualitative differences of computational processes. While whether such meta-representational systems exist in the human brain remains an open question, this formulation of meta-representation offers a new empirically testable hypothesis that there are brain regions that represent the processes of transforming a representation in one brain region to a representation in another brain region. Furthermore, this form of meta-representations might underlie our ability to describe the qualitative aspect of sensory experience or qualia."

One key aspect of immigrant children's experience is navigating multiple languages, creating both opportunities, and challenges. However, the literature on bilingualism rarely centers the experiences of immigrant children. Focusing on immigrant children in the United States, this article brings together cognitive science research on bilingualism with the integrative risk and resilience model of adaptation in immigrant-origin children to elucidate how common contexts that immigrant children encounter can support or discourage multilingualism. Policy must consider immigrant children's intersecting identities—both as immigrants and as learners of minoritized, and often racialized, languages. A proposed framework can guide policies to support multilingualism in immigrant children, with downstream consequences for their health and development."

Ex-ante honesty oaths—commitments to honesty before action—have been proposed as useful interventions to counteract dishonest behavior, but the heterogeneity in findings across operationalizations calls their effectiveness into question. We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)—proposed, evaluated, and selected by 44 expert researchers—and a no-oath condition in a megastudy in which 21,506 UK and US participants played an incentivized tax evasion game. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, but experts’ predictions were more accurate. In conclusion, honesty oaths can be effective in curbing dishonesty but their effectiveness varies depending on content. These findings can help design impactful interventions to curb dishonesty."

Here, the Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI) Form SERI (Socio(E]motional Regulation Inventory) was employed in a longitudinal population-based sample of Finnish twins (FinnTwin 12) at age 17 to study: (1) the structure of self-ratings on self-regulation of socioemotional behavior, (2) concurrent, discriminative, and predictive validity of the scales, and (3) genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in self-regulation. A bipolar factor for self-regulation was interpreted as representing p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity). Each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale that comprised Hyperactivity/Inattention, Aggression, and Anxiety subscales, and a Prosocial behavior scale. These scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14, and good discriminative validity with items for social position and resilience. Modeling the twin data indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and are influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors. The inventory can be used for self- and sibling ratings in a population study."

In most cases, GMMs are based on scores from item responses collected using survey scales or other measures. Research already shows that GMMs can be sensitive to departures from ideal modeling conditions, and that growth model results outside of GMMs are sensitive to decisions about how item responses are scored, but the impact of scoring decisions on GMMs has never been investigated. We start to close that gap in the literature with the current study. Through empirical and Monte Carlo studies, we show that GMM results—including convergence, class enumeration, and latent growth trajectories within class—are extremely sensitive to seemingly arcane measurement decisions. Further, our results make clear that, because GMM latent classes are not known a priori, measurement models used to produce scores for use in GMMs are, almost by definition, misspecified because they cannot account for group membership. Misspecification of the measurement model then, in turn, biases GMM results. Practical implications of these results are discussed. Our findings raise serious concerns that many results in the current GMM literature may be driven, in part or whole, by measurement artifacts rather than substantive differences in developmental trends."

The application helps learners automatise multiplications through repeated practice over three levels of difficulty. In a naturalistic setting involving more than 500 primary school students (ages 6-10) who together recorded over 200,000 responses, we observed that performance improved as learners using the application progressed through the levels. A model-based analysis of performance revealed that learners' estimated speed of forgetting decreased from the second to the third level. This is consistent with a shift towards stronger declarative knowledge and/or more efficient computation procedures. The model also identified consistent differences in the difficulty of individual multiplication facts that persisted across levels. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an adaptive fact learning application to help young learners automatise multiplication, an essential mathematical skill."

Autistic individuals, however, favor local and fine information, conveyed by high spatial frequencies. This suggests that atypical predictive processes from low spatial frequencies may contribute to facial processing difficulties in autism. Nonetheless, since autistic females often present better socio-communicational abilities than males, we hypothesized that a more typical coarse-to-fine processing should be seen in autistic females than males for socioemotional stimuli. Method: To test this hypothesis, we asked adult participants (44 autistic, 51 non-autistic) to detect fearful faces among neutral faces, filtered in two orders: from coarse to fine (CtF) and from fine to coarse (FtC). Results: Results show lower d’ values and longer reaction times for fearful detection in autism compared to non-autistic individuals, irrespective of the filtering order. Both groups presented shorter P100 latency after CtF compared to FtC, and faster and larger amplitude for N170 after FtC compared to CtF. Nevertheless, autistic participants presented reduced differences between CtF and FtC in the fusiform, which was more spatially spread in autistic females compared to NA females. This suggests reduced spatial frequency differentiation in autism. Finally, females had faster P100 and N170, and larger occipital activation for FtC sequences than males, regardless of the group. Conclusions: The results do not suggest impaired predictive processes from LSF in autism despite behavioral differences in fear detection. Nonetheless, they indicate sex differences that need to be considered."

Rose","Instruments for rating socioemotional behavior with a strong theoretical basis, broad coverage of behaviors, and that are well-validated are rare. Here, the Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI) Form SERI (Socio(E]motional Regulation Inventory) was employed in a longitudinal population-based sample of Finnish twins (FinnTwin 12) at age 17 to study: (1) the structure of self-ratings on self-regulation of socioemotional behavior, (2) concurrent, discriminative, and predictive validity of the scales, and (3) genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in self-regulation. A bipolar factor for self-regulation was interpreted as representing p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity). Each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale that comprised Hyperactivity/Inattention, Aggression, and Anxiety subscales, and a Prosocial behavior scale. These scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14, and good discriminative validity with items for social position and resilience. Modeling the twin data indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and are influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors. The inventory can be used for self- and sibling ratings in a population study."

Iancu, Myrthe Braam, Nathan McCabe, Thomas Wilschut, Hedderik van Rijn, Maarten van der Velde","We demonstrate an application for learning multiplication problems with an adaptive algorithm that is based on a computational cognitive model of the learner's memory. The application helps learners automatise multiplications through repeated practice over three levels of difficulty. In a naturalistic setting involving more than 500 primary school students (ages 6-10) who together recorded over 200,000 responses, we observed that performance improved as learners using the application progressed through the levels. A model-based analysis of performance revealed that learners' estimated speed of forgetting decreased from the second to the third level. This is consistent with a shift towards stronger declarative knowledge and/or more efficient computation procedures. The model also identified consistent differences in the difficulty of individual multiplication facts that persisted across levels. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an adaptive fact learning application to help young learners automatise multiplication, an essential mathematical skill."

One key aspect of immigrant children's experience is navigating multiple languages, creating both opportunities, and challenges. However, the literature on bilingualism rarely centers the experiences of immigrant children. Focusing on immigrant children in the United States, this article brings together cognitive science research on bilingualism with the integrative risk and resilience model of adaptation in immigrant-origin children to elucidate how common contexts that immigrant children encounter can support or discourage multilingualism. Policy must consider immigrant children's intersecting identities—both as immigrants and as learners of minoritized, and often racialized, languages. A proposed framework can guide policies to support multilingualism in immigrant children, with downstream consequences for their health and development."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5jkfz,2024-03-05,On the Nature of Measurement,"Derek Briggs, andrew maul, Josh McGrane","Over time, the concept of measurement has come to be associated with precision, accuracy, objectivity, and overall trustworthiness. In this chapter we engage with the question of how educational measurement can be understood with respect to measurement more broadly, and if and how instances of educational measurement earn this claimed trustworthiness. In section 2 of the chapter, we trace some key historical developments that help to explain how the concepts and terminology of measurement came to be invoked in educational and psychological contexts. In section 3 we argue that irrespective of the field of application or disciplinary context, successful instances of measurement will always involve certain components that serve to justify its claimed trustworthiness. We introduce a TISM framework for understanding measurement with respect to four central components: Theory (T), Instrumentation (I), Scales &amp; Units (S), and Modeling (M). We illustrate and apply the TISM framework briefly to the physical science context of measuring temperature and then more extensively to the educational context of measuring reading comprehension. Although the central components of measurement are present in each context, there are unique challenges in education. In section 4 of the chapter, we take a closer look at three of these challenges that are likely to remain areas for discussion and debate in the future: (1) the meaning of validity and how this should inform measurement practices, (2) evolving conceptualizations of measurement error and uncertainty, and (3) the role of measuring scales and units in the evaluation of magnitudes."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zg27u,2024-03-04,Meta-Representations as Representations of Processes,"Ryota Kanai, Ryota Takatsuki, Ippei Fujisawa","In this study, we explore how the notion of meta-representations in Higher-Order Theories (HOT) of consciousness can be implemented in computational models. HOT suggests that consciousness emerges from meta-representations, which are representations of first-order sensory representations. However, translating this abstract concept into a concrete computational model, such as those used in artificial intelligence, presents a theoretical challenge. For example, a simplistic interpretation of meta-representation as a representation of representation makes the notion rather trivial and ubiquitous. Here, we propose a refined interpretation of meta-representations. Contrary to the simplistic view of meta-representations as mere transformations of the first-order representational states or confidence estimates, we argue that meta-representations are representations of the processes that generate first-order representations. This presents a process-oriented view whereby meta-representations capture the qualitative aspect of how sensory information is transformed into first-order representations. To concretely illustrate and operationalize thus formulated notion of meta-representation, we constructed ""meta-networks"" designed to explicitly model meta-representations within deep learning architectures. Specifically, we constructed meta-networks by implementing autoencoders of first-order neural networks. In this architecture, the latent spaces embedding those first-order networks correspond to the meta-representations of first-order networks. By applying meta-networks to embed neural networks trained to encode visual and auditory datasets, we show that the meta-representations of first-order networks successfully capture the qualitative aspects of those networks by separating the visual and auditory networks in the meta-representation space. We argue that such meta-representations would be useful for quantitatively compare and contrast the qualitative differences of computational processes. While whether such meta-representational systems exist in the human brain remains an open question, this formulation of meta-representation offers a new empirically testable hypothesis that there are brain regions that represent the processes of transforming a representation in one brain region to a representation in another brain region. Furthermore, this form of meta-representations might underlie our ability to describe the qualitative aspect of sensory experience or qualia."

Elbaek, John Michael, Mathilde Hedegaard Tønnesen, Gabriel Levy, Shahar Ayal, Eyal Peer, Eileen Y Chou, Ulrich Glogowsky","Dishonest behaviors such as tax evasion impose significant societal costs. Ex-ante honesty oaths—commitments to honesty before action—have been proposed as useful interventions to counteract dishonest behavior, but the heterogeneity in findings across operationalizations calls their effectiveness into question. We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)—proposed, evaluated, and selected by 44 expert researchers—and a no-oath condition in a megastudy in which 21,506 UK and US participants played an incentivized tax evasion game. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, but experts’ predictions were more accurate. In conclusion, honesty oaths can be effective in curbing dishonesty but their effectiveness varies depending on content. These findings can help design impactful interventions to curb dishonesty."

This study tested the effectiveness of web-based CBM-I relative to an active psychoeducation condition and the addition of low-intensity telecoaching for a subset of CBM-I participants. Method: 1,234 anxious community adults (M_age = 35.09 years, 81.2% female, 72.1% white, 82.6% not Hispanic) were randomly assigned at Stage 1 of a sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial to complete five weekly sessions of CBM-I or psychoeducation on our team’s public research website. After the first session, for Stage 2, an algorithm attempted to classify CBM-I participants as higher (vs. lower) risk for dropping out; those classified as higher risk were then randomly assigned to complete four brief weekly telecoaching check-ins (vs. no coaching). Results: As hypothesized (https://doi.org/j2xr; Daniel, Eberle, &amp; Teachman, 2020), CBM-I significantly outperformed psychoeducation at improving positive and negative interpretation biases (Recognition Ratings, Brief Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire) and anxiety symptoms (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, Anxiety Scale from Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–Short Form), with smaller treatment gains remaining significant at 2-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, CBM-I had significantly worse treatment dropout outcomes than psychoeducation, and adding coaching (vs. no coaching) did not significantly improve efficacy or dropout outcomes (notably, many participants chose not to interact with their coach). Conclusions: Web-based CBM-I appears effective, but supplemental coaching may not mitigate the challenge of dropout."

Assessing microplastic-related threat potential for planetary health as a political participation catalyzer,To be fetched,"As the 1.5-degree goal threatens to grow more distant, the need to address human behavior in strategies to mitigate climate change further increases. With recent evidence indicating harmful effects of microplastic exposure to human and natural systems, we tested based on Rogers’ Protection Motivation Theory whether planetary health framing, which is considered a promising tool for climate change communication, is suitable for raising concerns about the issue. Following a mixed-methods design, we employed a  2 x 2 between-subjects vignette experiment (N = 898) to explore the connection between planetary health framing and one’s intention to participate politically across different levels of psychological distance, while strengthening the understanding of the behavior itself. Therefore, we subjected 1,992 open-text responses to a qualitative analysis assessing which dimensions of political participation are considered relevant, and what obstacles populate the gap between intention to participate and actual participation.  The experimental data shows that varying the planetary health condition does not result in significant differences, whereas distance framing showed an inversed effect pattern contrary to what our hypotheses expected. This highlights the urgent need for further research on planetary health as a framing subject. The qualitative findings on behavior dimensions provide an enriched proposal for adapting existing instruments to measure political participation in a variety of public life contexts. Data on barriers to political participation show various internal and external reasons that can be used to develop a scale for response costs, which could lead to a more comprehensive model of political participation readiness in the context of planetary health framing."

Ninety-six young adults completed the Autobiographical Memory Task, consisting of 6 negative and 6 positive cue words that were used to elicit autobiographical memories. Individual differences (i.e., between-person variance) in emotion regulation difficulties predicted increased vividness, and avoidant coping predicted third-person perspective in negative autobiographical memories.

SA was measured by Situation Present Awareness Method.  Workload was measured objectively by latency to SA queries. Experiment 2 extended the findings by utilizing a similar methodology on a different automated-assisted subtask - aircraft conflict detection. Experiment 2 retained SA and workload measures with the addition of the NASA-TLX for subjective workload. In both experiments, poorer multi-taskers exhibited greater benefits from automation applied to acceptance and hand-off, improved conflict detection and reduced workload. SA was greater in better multi-taskers. This work underscores the importance of considering individual cognitive differences when designing automated systems."

Results: As hypothesized (https://doi.org/j2xr; Daniel, Eberle, &amp; Teachman, 2020), CBM-I significantly outperformed psychoeducation at improving positive and negative interpretation biases (Recognition Ratings, Brief Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire) and anxiety symptoms (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, Anxiety Scale from Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–Short Form), with smaller treatment gains remaining significant at 2-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, CBM-I had significantly worse treatment dropout outcomes than psychoeducation, and adding coaching (vs. no coaching) did not significantly improve efficacy or dropout outcomes (notably, many participants chose not to interact with their coach). Conclusions: Web-based CBM-I appears effective, but supplemental coaching may not mitigate the challenge of dropout."

We then tested an intervention to mitigate this effect: inducing an accuracy mindset. In both general population samples (N_India =  997; N_Philippines = 1184) and a second field experiment with professional content moderators (N = 239), we replicate the illusory truth effect in the control condition, and find that inducing participants to consider accuracy when first exposed to the claims eliminates any effect of exposure on belief in falsehoods. These results show that both the illusory truth effect and the protective power of an accuracy mindset generalize to non-Western populations and professional content moderators. These results highlight the importance of accuracy mindset interventions for ensuring a healthy internet for everyone."

We found that they could discriminate pairs of same-sized objects ranging from one to eight, with performance improving as the difference ratio between the two numbers increased. In addition, their performance also improved as the magnitude of the number of objects involved increased. An additional test revealed that the accuracy of discrimination through echolocation was comparable to that of visual relative quantity judgments of the objects presented above water. On the other hand, under the condition that the overall size of each object (i.e., the sum of areas) was incongruent with the number of objects, performance was lower than when number and size were covarying. However, even within the incongruent condition, the effect of the number ratio was still observed, suggesting that the dolphins might have used various types of quantity information, such as number and size, flexibly to solve the task."

Increasing rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth underscore the need to identify early predictors of risk. Theorists propose that the desire to die is driven by intense distress following social disconnection or rejection. Although ample empirical evidence supports the link between social factors and suicidality, there remains a gap in understanding how distinct processes within social communication relate to suicidality. We empirically demonstrate how two indicators of social communication (reciprocity of eye-gaze and facial expressions of happiness) differ during parent-adolescent conflict between dyads with adolescents who experience future suicidal ideation (SI) and those who do not. Methods. Facial affect analyses were based on a sample of 103 girls (ages 11-13; M=12.28; 75% White) and their parents (88.3% mothers). Eye-gaze analyses were conducted in subset of these dyads (N = 65; 90% mothers). Participants completed a conflict discussion as a part of a laboratory-based interaction paradigm during which participants’ gaze to their partners’ eyes was assessed using mobile eye-tracking glasses and facial affect was coded from videos of the discussion using FaceReader Observer XT. Adolescents’ SI was assessed 12-months later using the four-item suicide composite on the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Results.  We used actor-partner interdependence models within a multi-level structural equation modeling framework to test whether participants’ gaze and affect predicted their own and their partners’ gaze and affect one second later and if these intra and interpersonal dynamics would differ in dyads with and without future adolescent SI.

The optimization of heat transfer within these heat sinks is paramount for enhancing thermal management in various applications. Among the critical factors influencing heat transfer characteristics, surface roughness of microchannel walls has garnered significant attention due to its profound impact on convective heat transfer and fluid flow behavior. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the influence of surface roughness on heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks, particularly focusing on electronic cooling applications. The research employs a combination of numerical simulations and experimental analyses to explore the intricate interplay between surface roughness, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics within microchannels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted to model the heat transfer phenomena and fluid flow behavior in microchannel heat sinks with varying degrees of surface roughness. Additionally, experimental studies are conducted to validate the simulation results and provide empirical insights into the heat transfer characteristics under different surface roughness conditions. The outcomes of this research elucidate the complex relationship between surface roughness and heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks. Through systematic analyses of thermal resistance, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficients, the study identifies optimal surface roughness parameters for maximizing heat dissipation efficiency while minimizing pressure drop penalties. Furthermore, the insights gained from this investigation facilitate the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks tailored to specific electronic cooling requirements. Overall, the findings from this study contribute to the advancement of thermal management techniques for electronic devices, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks for enhanced heat dissipation capabilities in electronic cooling applications."

Recent evidence, however, points towards an important role of stimulus mode in the emergence of reciprocal compatibility effects. We investigated the reciprocity of the SSARC effect with a different stimulus mode, namely with verbal size/location stimuli and vocal responses.

In Study 1, findings from exploratory moderated-mediation analyses indicated that the appraised negative valence of African history was associated with an increase in identification and group-based action when African history was appraised as unimportant (history-as-contrast). Conversely, the appraised positive valence of African history was also associated with an increase in identification and group-based action when African history was also appraised as important (history-as-inspiration).

Preliminary analyses revealed that Muslim youth in our sample are characterized by high religious identity during adolescence, represented by high values on religious identity exploration and resolution. Latent-change score models demonstrated that greater changes in Muslim youth’s religious identity exploration predicted higher religious identity resolution, resulting in better self-acceptance and a higher sense of global identity. However, Muslim youth who showed a clear sense of their religious identity, did not indicate less affective and somatic depressive symptoms. We conclude that for Muslim youth religion seems to constitute an important part of their identity while promoting their positive adjustment. Our results indicate that multicultural approaches in schools – such as the Identity Project – should not only respond to students’ ethnic identities but should also more explicitly cater to their religious identities."

The optimization of heat transfer within these heat sinks is paramount for enhancing thermal management in various applications. Among the critical factors influencing heat transfer characteristics, surface roughness of microchannel walls has garnered significant attention due to its profound impact on convective heat transfer and fluid flow behavior. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the influence of surface roughness on heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks, particularly focusing on electronic cooling applications. The research employs a combination of numerical simulations and experimental analyses to explore the intricate interplay between surface roughness, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics within microchannels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted to model the heat transfer phenomena and fluid flow behavior in microchannel heat sinks with varying degrees of surface roughness. Additionally, experimental studies are conducted to validate the simulation results and provide empirical insights into the heat transfer characteristics under different surface roughness conditions. The outcomes of this research elucidate the complex relationship between surface roughness and heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks. Through systematic analyses of thermal resistance, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficients, the study identifies optimal surface roughness parameters for maximizing heat dissipation efficiency while minimizing pressure drop penalties. Furthermore, the insights gained from this investigation facilitate the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks tailored to specific electronic cooling requirements. Overall, the findings from this study contribute to the advancement of thermal management techniques for electronic devices, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks for enhanced heat dissipation capabilities in electronic cooling applications."

Given how important expectations of learning are for actual learning, we explored whether people accurately intuit this canonical progression in skill learning. Across five pre-registered experiments (n = 375), we find that people correctly predict that skill learning on a novel visuomotor task follows an exponential decay function, both for a naïve player and themselves, before even engaging with the task. Importantly, people are sensitive to conditions that merit exponential learning and rationally only predict exponential learning curves when a player puts in effort and the task is not too difficult. Although people accurately represent the overall shape of their learning in our task, we find that they misestimate specific parameters, which may have negative downstream effects on learning outcomes."

We also examined whether there were differences between men and women in this context. We jointly analyzed results from seven independent cross-sectional samples examined between 2017 and 2022 in Poland. A total of 5454 parents aged 18 to 59 participated in the studies at different stages of parenthood: up to 3 years after becoming a parent, being a parent for 4 to 7 years, being a parent for 8 to 12 years and being a parent for 13 years or more. Parents at different stages of parenthood were found to have significantly different levels of in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment. The results suggest that in the first years of parenthood, parents experience a relatively high in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment, which may decrease over time. The analyses also indicated that women are characterized by higher levels of in-depth exploration than men at each stage of parenthood. Men, on the other hand, experience stronger identity uncertainty related to their role as a parent."

Though it is generally thought to exert detrimental effects on executive functions, the effects of acute stress on cognitive processing have largely been studied in younger, college-aged populations. In this study we tested the effects of acute stress on working memory and executive control in a large sample of male and female middle and older-aged participants using a fully remote online stress paradigm. Participants (n=132, age: 43-74) were randomly assigned to either a control or stress condition, which consisted of a challenging arithmetic task with false normative feedback and distressing videos. All participants rated their affective state and perceived stress levels throughout the experiment. To evaluate the effects of stress on cognitive performance, participants completed a spatial working memory task (Corsi block tapping) before and after the manipulation as well as a verbal working memory task (n-back) and executive control task (Stroop color-word interference) after the manipulation. As expected, the Stress group reported significantly worse mood than the control group, indicating the effectiveness of our online protocol. Behaviorally, we found a generally beneficial effect of stress on cognitive performance, though, notably, stress-induced benefits varied by sex in a task-dependent manner. Our results suggest that in middle and older aged adults acute stress is generally associated with improvements rather than impairments in executive function, which may reflect the ability to recruit additional resources for cognitive processing in a way that is sex dependent."

Little is known, however, about how this affects young children’s interactions with their caregivers. In this within-subjects study, we explored whether facial masks influence young children’s initiation and response to joint attention. We measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old infants with one of their caregivers using two standardised and free-play tasks. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks previously and are not influenced in their joint attention when the lower part of the caregiver’s face is concealed. Preface: This paper is associated with the paper “How Do Facial Masks Impact Infants’ Joint Attention?”. In the current text, we describe additional hypotheses and report the according analyses, results, and discussion."

OBJECTIVE: To gain evidence from FRs relating to the impact of exposure to occupational trauma and describe the development of and planned protocol for testing an evidence-based, co-created DI called Sentinel to help manage and prevent trauma among FRs. METHODS: In phase 1, we conducted 52 interviews with FRs from fire and emergency, police, and emergency healthcare to explore the needs, views and experiences on using DI to support mental health. During phase 2, we developed the DI (Sentinel) content in consultation with current evidence, policy, theory and FRs experience. In phase 3, we plan to conduct a series of codesign workshops and development sprints to test and refine the DI (Sentinel). In phase 4, we will conduct a mixed methods non-randomized study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, usability and safety of the DI (Sentinel).  RESULTS: We expect data to be collected from up to 50 FRs for feasibility testing. We expect to conduct approximately 30 qualitative interviews with FRs who engaged in the Sentinel trial and 20 health and social care professionals who referred FRs to the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, safety, usability and implementation potential of the DI (Sentinel). The findings will inform the decision to proceed with a powered efficacy trial."

At present, climate anxiety is not operationalized consistently across the existing literature. It is important to gain more consensus on the definition and operationalization of climate anxiety to facilitate reliable and generalizable research and to further develop interventions. Content analysis can contribute to this by providing insight into the overlap in the content of climate anxiety measures. With a systematic search, this study identified and analyzed 12 distinct scales measuring climate anxiety. The 119 items covered a total of 57 disparate symptoms. Jaccard indices showed that the mean overlap between symptoms of different climate anxiety scales was generally very low, as was the overlap between pairwise comparisons of climate anxiety scales. These results highlight the lack of uniformity in assessing climate anxiety and the need to properly define and operationalize this concept. The potential reasons for low overlap and how this might impact the reliability and validity of existing measures is discussed. It is critical that future work aims at finding consensus on the definition of climate anxiety (e.g., through a Delphi study) and psychometrically comparing the different questionnaires."

In the present study, we addressed this gap by comparing older and younger adults’ performance in a cross-situational word learning paradigm, where participants learned novel word-referent mappings via statistical tracking of co-occurrences across multiple trials. Moreover, we tested whether this learning process was affected by previous experience with multiple languages (i.e., the bilingualism effect). We found that both age groups successfully learned non-native words after a short exposure, confirming that statistical learning ability is preserved in late adulthood. The two groups, however, differed in their learning trajectories and the younger group outperformed the older group during the later stages of learning. Previous language experience did not predict learning outcomes. Our findings have implications for language education in the older population, suggesting that implicit exposure is powerful for older adults learning a foreign language."

And yet, relatively little is known about what causes them. We provide an information-theoretic operationalization for two previous qualitative hypotheses about regressions, which we dub reactivation and reanalysis. We argue that these hypotheses make different predictions about the pointwise mutual information or pmi between a regression’s source and target. Intuitively, the pmi between two words measures how much more (or less) likely one word is to be present given the other. On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should occur between words that are disassociated with each other, implying negative, low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty, and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested: Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature. Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic principles."

Daum, Lea Mörsdorf, Charlotte Baldenweg","During the COVID-19 pandemic, children frequently interacted with people wearing facial masks. Little is known, however, about how this affects young children’s interactions with their caregivers. In this within-subjects study, we explored whether facial masks influence young children’s initiation and response to joint attention. We measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old infants with one of their caregivers using two standardised and free-play tasks. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks previously and are not influenced in their joint attention when the lower part of the caregiver’s face is concealed. Preface: This paper is associated with the paper “How Do Facial Masks Impact Infants’ Joint Attention?”. In the current text, we describe additional hypotheses and report the according analyses, results, and discussion."

Parents at different stages of parenthood were found to have significantly different levels of in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment. The results suggest that in the first years of parenthood, parents experience a relatively high in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment, which may decrease over time. The analyses also indicated that women are characterized by higher levels of in-depth exploration than men at each stage of parenthood.

Ross Otto, Madeleine Sharp","Acute stress is a ubiquitous feature of everyday life, affecting young and old alike. Though it is generally thought to exert detrimental effects on executive functions, the effects of acute stress on cognitive processing have largely been studied in younger, college-aged populations. In this study we tested the effects of acute stress on working memory and executive control in a large sample of male and female middle and older-aged participants using a fully remote online stress paradigm. Participants (n=132, age: 43-74) were randomly assigned to either a control or stress condition, which consisted of a challenging arithmetic task with false normative feedback and distressing videos. All participants rated their affective state and perceived stress levels throughout the experiment. To evaluate the effects of stress on cognitive performance, participants completed a spatial working memory task (Corsi block tapping) before and after the manipulation as well as a verbal working memory task (n-back) and executive control task (Stroop color-word interference) after the manipulation. As expected, the Stress group reported significantly worse mood than the control group, indicating the effectiveness of our online protocol. Behaviorally, we found a generally beneficial effect of stress on cognitive performance, though, notably, stress-induced benefits varied by sex in a task-dependent manner. Our results suggest that in middle and older aged adults acute stress is generally associated with improvements rather than impairments in executive function, which may reflect the ability to recruit additional resources for cognitive processing in a way that is sex dependent."

Given how important expectations of learning are for actual learning, we explored whether people accurately intuit this canonical progression in skill learning. Across five pre-registered experiments (n = 375), we find that people correctly predict that skill learning on a novel visuomotor task follows an exponential decay function, both for a naïve player and themselves, before even engaging with the task. Importantly, people are sensitive to conditions that merit exponential learning and rationally only predict exponential learning curves when a player puts in effort and the task is not too difficult. Although people accurately represent the overall shape of their learning in our task, we find that they misestimate specific parameters, which may have negative downstream effects on learning outcomes."

Psychologists, among other professionals, were required to suddenly work remotely via telehealth during a period of global uncertainty, illness and mortality, community anxiety and lockdowns. This drastically altered the psychology practice, with the effects on clients and professionals still not fully understood. Aim To develop and validate a COVID-19-Related Stress Scale to evaluate psychologists’ experiences relating to the pandemic.  Methods The items of the COVID-19-Related Stress Scale were constructed based on an extensive qualitative report from the British Psychological Society, which identified key themes in psychologists’ pandemic experiences. Eight items were initially developed. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted, as well as tests for convergent and discriminant validity.  Results The sample comprised 99 psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand. After corrected item-total correlation testing, five items with significant and strong factor loadings (0.60 to 0.74) and two items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.54 to 0.56) were confirmed, resulting in a scale of seven items.  Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was α = .83, supporting a single-factor model (COVID-related stress, CVRS). A moderate relationship was found between CVRS and stress and compassion fatigue, validating its utility as a measure of stress. In contrast, no relationship was seen with resilience as a discriminant construct. Conclusion The Covid-19-related stress scale shows robust psychometric properties, which usefully assessed the impact of COVID-19 among psychologists in NZ. Although the lockdown phase of the pandemic has since ended, this measure provides valuable insights into the retrospective experiences of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. It may be adapted for unexpected scenarios requiring remote therapy, such as pandemics and natural disasters. The effect of remote work and community stress on mental health professionals requires ongoing consideration, and we propose that the CVRS is a useful tool for this research."

Despite previous research acknowledging this difficulty, the specific dynamics of the argumentative essay writing process and where breakdowns occur remain unclear. In this study, we modeled the componential process underlying argumentative essay writing from multiple documents to understand the interactions among components that result in quality argumentation. The data were fitted to two competing theory-based Bayesian networks, a method highly suited to the modeling of cognitive processes identified with argumentative writing. The best-fitting model showed that the argumentative essay task is both initiated and sustained by higher-order integration components. This model lends support to the description of the process of argumentation writing from multiple documents put forth by the stage-based Integrated Framework of Multiple Texts. Further, we found that the process of argumentation falters due to students’ inability to frame counterarguments and their non-optimal critical analysis. This research not only enriches our understanding of the mechanics of argumentative writing from multiple sources, but the innovative Bayesian approach could lead to further refinement of the model by future researchers."

Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton 2023 Phil Trans R Soc B 378: 20210455 proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth."

But dyads exist embedded in broader, densely-interconnected social networks, and less research attention has been paid to the myriad ways in which people outside the dyad impact one’s welfare through their interactions with, or even their attitudes about, the other member of the dyad. What drives our feelings toward such extra-dyadic individuals? Balance Theory, an influential formalist theory in social psychology, suggests that our feelings are driven by the need for affective balance, achieved by, for example, liking strangers who share our feelings toward our existing partners or by disliking strangers who do not. We propose an alternative theory, the Embedded Dyad Framework, which foregrounds the substantive effects that strangers can have on our welfare through their interactions with our dyadic partners. Across four experiments (N=1,589) with U.S.-residing participants we predict and find, consistent with the Embedded Dyad Framework, that we like strangers who share our hatred for our rivals and our love for our friends (consistent with Balance Theory); but we dislike strangers who share our love for our spouses (contradicting Balance Theory). Further supporting predictions from an Embedded Dyad Framework, (a) greater perceived exclusivity in welfare-enhancing dyadic relationships (e.g., friendships) drives our lesser liking of strangers who share our love for our partners, and (b) greater perceived welfare suppression by our antagonistic partners (e.g., rivals) drives our liking of strangers who share our hatred of our antagonists. This framework outpredicts cognitive consistency views by emphasizing the real threats and opportunities that dyadic relationships afford people when dyads are embedded in social networks."

Relatedly, propensity for mind-wandering—or task unrelated thought—has been gaining attention among creativity scholars, but its effects on creativity remain unclear. The present study conceptually replicates and extends recent laboratory and experience-sampling work to assess the links between individual differences in divergent thinking, executive control abilities (working memory capacity and attention control), and measures of mind-wandering collected in both contexts. SEM analyses indicated that executive control factors weakly predicted divergent thinking scores, mainly due to their role in filtering out uncreative ideas rather than generating highly novel ones. Lab-based measures of mind-wandering didn't significantly correlate with overall creative thinking, challenging the idea that mind-wandering uniformly enhances creativity, but they were positively linked to highly creative divergent thinking scores. Daily-life measures of mind-wandering, meanwhile, did not provide stronger predictive insights into creative thinking than lab measures. Finally, exploratory analyses found that divergent thinking scores based on highly creative responses were positively associated with episodes of more fantastical, unrealistic mind-wandering, or “daydreaming.” We end our investigation with a call for greater theoretical precision and some hypotheses to guide future work.

This has been explained in terms of dynamical systems theory where internal oscillators couple to external rhythms for more fluent processing; this coupling is more efficient the closer the external rhythms are to the preferred rates of the internal oscillators. Thus, this more efficient coupling at one’s preferred rate should be associated with lower cognitive demands and better attentional entrainment compared to faster or slower rates. We tested this by measuring participants’ pupil sizes, a proxy for noradrenergic attention, while either listening or synchronizing their finger taps to metronomes played at rates faster, slower, or at their preferred rate. We found that synchronizing (relative to listening) to the faster and slower metronomes evoked larger pupil sizes whereas there was no difference at participants’ preferred rate. In line with dynamical systems theory, these results demonstrate that synchronizing is more cognitively demanding than listening only at tempi beyond one’s preferred rate. Furthermore, pupillary phase coherence increased while synchronizing compared to listening to all three metronomes, indicating that synchronous movements resulted in more efficiently allocated attention. Beyond their theoretical implications, our findings suggest that rehabilitation for movement disorders should be tailored to patients’ preferred rates to reduce cognitive demands. Moreover, attention and developmental disorders may benefit from pupillary entrainment as a diagnostic tool in rhythmic- and movement-based interventions."

Merrie, Jaimie Krems, Daniel Sznycer","Research on close relationships often focuses on the dyad (e.g., dyads of romantic partners) and on how dyad members affect each other’s welfare. But dyads exist embedded in broader, densely-interconnected social networks, and less research attention has been paid to the myriad ways in which people outside the dyad impact one’s welfare through their interactions with, or even their attitudes about, the other member of the dyad. What drives our feelings toward such extra-dyadic individuals? Balance Theory, an influential formalist theory in social psychology, suggests that our feelings are driven by the need for affective balance, achieved by, for example, liking strangers who share our feelings toward our existing partners or by disliking strangers who do not. We propose an alternative theory, the Embedded Dyad Framework, which foregrounds the substantive effects that strangers can have on our welfare through their interactions with our dyadic partners. Across four experiments (N=1,589) with U.S.-residing participants we predict and find, consistent with the Embedded Dyad Framework, that we like strangers who share our hatred for our rivals and our love for our friends (consistent with Balance Theory); but we dislike strangers who share our love for our spouses (contradicting Balance Theory). Further supporting predictions from an Embedded Dyad Framework, (a) greater perceived exclusivity in welfare-enhancing dyadic relationships (e.g., friendships) drives our lesser liking of strangers who share our love for our partners, and (b) greater perceived welfare suppression by our antagonistic partners (e.g., rivals) drives our liking of strangers who share our hatred of our antagonists. This framework outpredicts cognitive consistency views by emphasizing the real threats and opportunities that dyadic relationships afford people when dyads are embedded in social networks."

Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton 2023 Phil Trans R Soc B 378: 20210455 proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth."

The present study conceptually replicates and extends recent laboratory and experience-sampling work to assess the links between individual differences in divergent thinking, executive control abilities (working memory capacity and attention control), and measures of mind-wandering collected in both contexts. SEM analyses indicated that executive control factors weakly predicted divergent thinking scores, mainly due to their role in filtering out uncreative ideas rather than generating highly novel ones. Lab-based measures of mind-wandering didn't significantly correlate with overall creative thinking, challenging the idea that mind-wandering uniformly enhances creativity, but they were positively linked to highly creative divergent thinking scores. Daily-life measures of mind-wandering, meanwhile, did not provide stronger predictive insights into creative thinking than lab measures.

Despite previous research acknowledging this difficulty, the specific dynamics of the argumentative essay writing process and where breakdowns occur remain unclear. In this study, we modeled the componential process underlying argumentative essay writing from multiple documents to understand the interactions among components that result in quality argumentation. The data were fitted to two competing theory-based Bayesian networks, a method highly suited to the modeling of cognitive processes identified with argumentative writing. The best-fitting model showed that the argumentative essay task is both initiated and sustained by higher-order integration components. This model lends support to the description of the process of argumentation writing from multiple documents put forth by the stage-based Integrated Framework of Multiple Texts. Further, we found that the process of argumentation falters due to students’ inability to frame counterarguments and their non-optimal critical analysis. This research not only enriches our understanding of the mechanics of argumentative writing from multiple sources, but the innovative Bayesian approach could lead to further refinement of the model by future researchers."

Psychologists, among other professionals, were required to suddenly work remotely via telehealth during a period of global uncertainty, illness and mortality, community anxiety and lockdowns. This drastically altered the psychology practice, with the effects on clients and professionals still not fully understood. Aim To develop and validate a COVID-19-Related Stress Scale to evaluate psychologists’ experiences relating to the pandemic.  Methods The items of the COVID-19-Related Stress Scale were constructed based on an extensive qualitative report from the British Psychological Society, which identified key themes in psychologists’ pandemic experiences. Eight items were initially developed. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted, as well as tests for convergent and discriminant validity.  Results The sample comprised 99 psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand. After corrected item-total correlation testing, five items with significant and strong factor loadings (0.60 to 0.74) and two items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.54 to 0.56) were confirmed, resulting in a scale of seven items.  Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was α = .83, supporting a single-factor model (COVID-related stress, CVRS). A moderate relationship was found between CVRS and stress and compassion fatigue, validating its utility as a measure of stress. In contrast, no relationship was seen with resilience as a discriminant construct. Conclusion The Covid-19-related stress scale shows robust psychometric properties, which usefully assessed the impact of COVID-19 among psychologists in NZ. Although the lockdown phase of the pandemic has since ended, this measure provides valuable insights into the retrospective experiences of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. It may be adapted for unexpected scenarios requiring remote therapy, such as pandemics and natural disasters. The effect of remote work and community stress on mental health professionals requires ongoing consideration, and we propose that the CVRS is a useful tool for this research."

A study space analysis of the existing evidence.,To be fetched,"Because child-directed speech (CDS) is ubiquitous in some cultures and because positive associations between certain features of the language input and certain learning outcomes have been attested it has often been claimed that the function of CDS is to aid children’s language development in general. We argue that for this claim to be generalisable, superior learning from CDS compared to non-CDS, such as adult-directed speech (ADS), must be demonstrated across multiple input domains and learning outcomes. To determine the availability of such evidence we performed a study space analysis of the research literature on CDS. A total of 942 relevant papers were coded with respect to (i) CDS features under consideration, (ii) learning outcomes and (iii) whether a comparison between CDS and ADS was reported. The results show that only 16.2% of peer-reviewed studies in this field compared learning outcomes between CDS and ADS, almost half of which focussed on the ability to discriminate between the two registers. Crucially, we found only 20 studies comparing learning outcomes between CDS and ADS for morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features and none for pragmatic and extra-linguistic features. Although these 20 studies provided preliminary evidence for a facilitative effect of some specific morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features, overall CDS-ADS comparison studies are very unevenly distributed across the space of CDS features and outcome measures. The disproportional emphasis on prosodic, phonetic, and phonological input features, and register discrimination as the outcome invites caution with respect to the generalisability of the claim that CDS facilitates language development across the breadth of input domains and learning outcomes. Future research ought to resolve the discrepancy between sweeping claims about the function of CDS as facilitating language development on the one hand and the narrow evidence base for such a claim on the other by conducting CDS-ADS comparisons across a wider range of input features and outcome measures."

Focusing on sexual identity, and employing a letter writing paradigm, we investigated the content of wisdom that LGB elders have to share with youth. In a descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods, and pre-registered study, 94 adults ranging in age 50 to 79 years (M = 55.98; SD = 6.30) wrote letters to a fictional youth, Sam, as well as completed surveys of psychosocial development and well-being. Letters were content coded for themes, as well as for emotional tone and subjective perspective.  The most common themes of wisdom shared included knowing and celebrating oneself, negotiating an oppressive society, and finding one’s community. Those who wrote more emotionally positive letters scored higher on measures of wisdom and generativity, and lower on embitterment. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of cultivating opportunities for wisdom-sharing within LGBTQ+ communities to promote flourishing across the lifespan."

Yet, little is known about the individual differences that shape the relationship between interpersonal synchronization to music and social bonding. The present research tests the hypothesis that this association is influenced by differences in empathy and creativity - two highly relevant factors in many musical activities. We implemented a synchronization task featuring a virtual drummer and measured self-other integration, a core component of social bonding. We employed a dual-measurement paradigm, incorporating both an explicit assessment (Inclusion of Other in the Self scale) and an implicit assessment (joint-Simon effect) of self-other integration . Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal explicit and implicit measurements correlating, nor were they similarly affected by interpersonal synchronization. This raises questions about the assessment of self-other integration in interpersonal synchronization experiments. Furthermore, we observed no moderating role of empathy or creativity in the association between interpersonal synchronization and self-other integration. Nevertheless, we found creativity to correlate with self-other integration. In light of this finding, we recommend placing greater emphasis on creativity as a decisive factor in the study of musical interaction."

No significant interactions emerged when neural reward function was modeled as a latent factor. Secondary analyses showed that higher perceived social threat was associated with more severe SA symptoms two years later only for girls with higher basolateral amygdala (BLA) activation to social reward cues at baseline. Interaction effects were specific to BLA activation to social reward (not threat) cues, though a main effect of BLA activation to social threat (vs. neutral) cues on SA emerged. Unexpectedly, interactions between social threat and BLA activation to social reward cues also predicted generalized anxiety and depression symptoms two years later, suggesting possible transdiagnostic risk pathways. Perceiving high social threat may be particularly detrimental for youth highly sensitive to reward incentives, potentially due to mediating reward learning processes, though this remains to be tested."

The book created a storm of controversy after its 1994 publication, including its authors’ claim that it is “highly likely…that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences” in mean IQ scores between U.S. Whites and Blacks (African Americans). In this review, we evaluate not only Herrnstein and Murray’s ethnic-differences claims, but also the evidence they cited in support of “substantial” within-group IQ heritability (now in conflict with recent modest molecular genetic results). We show that the “twins reared apart” (TRA) studies supplying what the authors called the “most unambiguous direct estimates” of IQ heritability contain numerous biases, and that the results of the “most modern” TRA IQ study were based on omitted control group data, a reliance on false assumptions, and other “questionable research practices.” We then describe the major problems, biases, and unsupported assumptions found in IQ family, reared-together twin, and adoption studies while calling into question the validity of long-disputed concepts such as “heritability,” “IQ,” and “race.” Like many others before us, we conclude that Herrnstein and Murray presented no valid evidence in support of genetic causes of between-ethnic-group or social-class IQ score differences. And like few others before us, we also conclude that they produced no valid evidence that genes influence IQ score differences within groups. As in 1994, the authors’ social and political policy recommendations should be rejected because, among other reasons, they are based on faulty research coming increasingly to light in science’s replication crisis."

Study 1 presents a reanalysis and meta-analytic integration of prior studies (N = 18,291, k = 27) on the relationships between FFM traits and RIASEC interests. Results indicated that all FFM traits are associated with different interest configurations and that the strength of the relationship varies between traits. Study 2 uses a latent circumplex model that partitions the shared variance among interest scales into individual differences in profile levels and profile configurations. This made it possible to estimate standardized effect sizes of the strength of the relationship that allow a more meaningful interpretation about the actual overlap between the construct domains. The latent model was applied to the aggregated correlation matrix from Study 1 and to two additional datasets from Germany (N = 1,032) and Belgium (N = 1,317) that used an alternative eight-type interest taxonomy. Results were remarkably consistent across taxonomies and samples. The associations between FFM traits and interest profiles were mainly attributable to interest configurations. Openness was nearly as strongly related to individual differences in interest configurations as a typical interest scale. Similar strong associations with interest configurations were also found for Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas those with Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were weaker. In sum, our findings suggest that the overlap between the two construct domains is considerably stronger than previously assumed."

However, the extent to which statistical learning is a key contribution for children learning an additional language is less clear. Also, statistical learning is generally conceived as involved in implicit language learning, and it is unclear whether explicit instructions can interoperate with statistical learning in supporting children’s additional language learning. In this study, we investigated the extent to which children could learn both vocabulary and grammar from cross-situational statistics, and also tested the effect of explicit instruction over the language structure on learning under two exposure conditions, implicit and explicit instruction. We trained and tested fifty children, aged 8 to 9 years, on a complex artificial language comprised of 12 pseudo-words including nouns, verbs and case markers in a verb-final sentence order by means of a widely-used CSL paradigm (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2021; Rebuschat et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2020). All participants in implicit and explicit instruction condition were asked to determine which of the two animated scenes the complex transitive sentences related to. Children in the explicit instruction condition were also taught the language structure (the verb-final word order), while no such explicit information was provided for children in implicit condition. Children’s awareness of grammar knowledge was measured through debriefing questions after the learning of the artificial language. Results showed that children in both conditions successfully learned the grammar, but not the vocabulary, with the support of cross-situational statistics. There was no evidence for an effect of instruction on grammar and vocabulary acquisition, though we did find an initial benefit to learning from explicit instruction about the language grammar. Furthermore, explicit instruction on grammar significantly improved the awareness of grammar knowledge (categorised based on responses from debriefing questionnaires), yet this increased explicit awareness did not relate to grammar learning. The results have implications for theories of statistical learning, shedding light on our understanding of its developmental differences across the lifespan as well as the potential contribution of explicit information on learning. The study also has practical implications for optimising interactions between language teaching strategies and the child’s learning environment."

This anxiety can lead to mental and emotional stress, potentially affecting individuals' mental health. Objectives : To investigate the social representation of this societal phenomenon and its intergenerational differences. Methods : The structuring of the social representation was conducted using the hierarchical verbal association method, a prototypical analysis, and a similarity analysis. Results : The findings suggest that, on one hand, eco-anxiety is subject to a structured social representation and, on the other hand, there is variability in this representation based on the generation to which one belongs at the time of the study. Conclusion : The representation of eco-anxiety is structurally different across generations, highlighting a greater significance of this phenomenon for the younger cohorts. Communication strategies and awareness campaigns about the impacts of climate change on our societies can benefit from considering these differences."

The book created a storm of controversy after its 1994 publication, including its authors’ claim that it is “highly likely…that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences” in mean IQ scores between U.S. Whites and Blacks (African Americans). In this review, we evaluate not only Herrnstein and Murray’s ethnic-differences claims, but also the evidence they cited in support of “substantial” within-group IQ heritability (now in conflict with recent modest molecular genetic results). We show that the “twins reared apart” (TRA) studies supplying what the authors called the “most unambiguous direct estimates” of IQ heritability contain numerous biases, and that the results of the “most modern” TRA IQ study were based on omitted control group data, a reliance on false assumptions, and other “questionable research practices.” We then describe the major problems, biases, and unsupported assumptions found in IQ family, reared-together twin, and adoption studies while calling into question the validity of long-disputed concepts such as “heritability,” “IQ,” and “race.” Like many others before us, we conclude that Herrnstein and Murray presented no valid evidence in support of genetic causes of between-ethnic-group or social-class IQ score differences. And like few others before us, we also conclude that they produced no valid evidence that genes influence IQ score differences within groups. As in 1994, the authors’ social and political policy recommendations should be rejected because, among other reasons, they are based on faulty research coming increasingly to light in science’s replication crisis."

However, the extent to which statistical learning is a key contribution for children learning an additional language is less clear. Also, statistical learning is generally conceived as involved in implicit language learning, and it is unclear whether explicit instructions can interoperate with statistical learning in supporting children’s additional language learning. In this study, we investigated the extent to which children could learn both vocabulary and grammar from cross-situational statistics, and also tested the effect of explicit instruction over the language structure on learning under two exposure conditions, implicit and explicit instruction. We trained and tested fifty children, aged 8 to 9 years, on a complex artificial language comprised of 12 pseudo-words including nouns, verbs and case markers in a verb-final sentence order by means of a widely-used CSL paradigm (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2021; Rebuschat et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2020). All participants in implicit and explicit instruction condition were asked to determine which of the two animated scenes the complex transitive sentences related to. Children in the explicit instruction condition were also taught the language structure (the verb-final word order), while no such explicit information was provided for children in implicit condition. Children’s awareness of grammar knowledge was measured through debriefing questions after the learning of the artificial language. Results showed that children in both conditions successfully learned the grammar, but not the vocabulary, with the support of cross-situational statistics. There was no evidence for an effect of instruction on grammar and vocabulary acquisition, though we did find an initial benefit to learning from explicit instruction about the language grammar. Furthermore, explicit instruction on grammar significantly improved the awareness of grammar knowledge (categorised based on responses from debriefing questionnaires), yet this increased explicit awareness did not relate to grammar learning. The results have implications for theories of statistical learning, shedding light on our understanding of its developmental differences across the lifespan as well as the potential contribution of explicit information on learning. The study also has practical implications for optimising interactions between language teaching strategies and the child’s learning environment."

Etzel, Bart Wille, Filip De Fruyt, Gabriel Nagy","This article proposes to link the Five Factor Model (FFM) personality traits to the vocational interest circumplex, a structural model for (1) the interrelations between interest domains and (2) individual differences in interest profiles. Study 1 presents a reanalysis and meta-analytic integration of prior studies (N = 18,291, k = 27) on the relationships between FFM traits and RIASEC interests. Results indicated that all FFM traits are associated with different interest configurations and that the strength of the relationship varies between traits. Study 2 uses a latent circumplex model that partitions the shared variance among interest scales into individual differences in profile levels and profile configurations. This made it possible to estimate standardized effect sizes of the strength of the relationship that allow a more meaningful interpretation about the actual overlap between the construct domains. The latent model was applied to the aggregated correlation matrix from Study 1 and to two additional datasets from Germany (N = 1,032) and Belgium (N = 1,317) that used an alternative eight-type interest taxonomy. Results were remarkably consistent across taxonomies and samples. The associations between FFM traits and interest profiles were mainly attributable to interest configurations. Openness was nearly as strongly related to individual differences in interest configurations as a typical interest scale. Similar strong associations with interest configurations were also found for Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas those with Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were weaker. In sum, our findings suggest that the overlap between the two construct domains is considerably stronger than previously assumed."

Hallion, Cecile D. Ladouceur","Recent theories suggest that for youth highly sensitive to incentives, perceiving more social threat may contribute to social anxiety (SA) symptoms. In 129 girls (ages 11-13) oversampled for shy/fearful temperament, we thus examined how interactions between neural responses to social reward (vs. neutral) cues (measured during anticipation of peer feedback) and perceived social threat in daily peer interactions (measured using ecological momentary assessment) predict SA symptoms two years later. No significant interactions emerged when neural reward function was modeled as a latent factor. Secondary analyses showed that higher perceived social threat was associated with more severe SA symptoms two years later only for girls with higher basolateral amygdala (BLA) activation to social reward cues at baseline. Interaction effects were specific to BLA activation to social reward (not threat) cues, though a main effect of BLA activation to social threat (vs. neutral) cues on SA emerged. Unexpectedly, interactions between social threat and BLA activation to social reward cues also predicted generalized anxiety and depression symptoms two years later, suggesting possible transdiagnostic risk pathways. Perceiving high social threat may be particularly detrimental for youth highly sensitive to reward incentives, potentially due to mediating reward learning processes, though this remains to be tested."

Yet, little is known about the individual differences that shape the relationship between interpersonal synchronization to music and social bonding. The present research tests the hypothesis that this association is influenced by differences in empathy and creativity - two highly relevant factors in many musical activities. We implemented a synchronization task featuring a virtual drummer and measured self-other integration, a core component of social bonding. We employed a dual-measurement paradigm, incorporating both an explicit assessment (Inclusion of Other in the Self scale) and an implicit assessment (joint-Simon effect) of self-other integration . Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal explicit and implicit measurements correlating, nor were they similarly affected by interpersonal synchronization. This raises questions about the assessment of self-other integration in interpersonal synchronization experiments. Furthermore, we observed no moderating role of empathy or creativity in the association between interpersonal synchronization and self-other integration. Nevertheless, we found creativity to correlate with self-other integration. In light of this finding, we recommend placing greater emphasis on creativity as a decisive factor in the study of musical interaction."

A study space analysis of the existing evidence.,"Vera Kempe, Mitsuhiko Ota, Sonja Schaeffler","Because child-directed speech (CDS) is ubiquitous in some cultures and because positive associations between certain features of the language input and certain learning outcomes have been attested it has often been claimed that the function of CDS is to aid children’s language development in general. We argue that for this claim to be generalisable, superior learning from CDS compared to non-CDS, such as adult-directed speech (ADS), must be demonstrated across multiple input domains and learning outcomes. To determine the availability of such evidence we performed a study space analysis of the research literature on CDS. A total of 942 relevant papers were coded with respect to (i) CDS features under consideration, (ii) learning outcomes and (iii) whether a comparison between CDS and ADS was reported. The results show that only 16.2% of peer-reviewed studies in this field compared learning outcomes between CDS and ADS, almost half of which focussed on the ability to discriminate between the two registers. Crucially, we found only 20 studies comparing learning outcomes between CDS and ADS for morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features and none for pragmatic and extra-linguistic features. Although these 20 studies provided preliminary evidence for a facilitative effect of some specific morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features, overall CDS-ADS comparison studies are very unevenly distributed across the space of CDS features and outcome measures. The disproportional emphasis on prosodic, phonetic, and phonological input features, and register discrimination as the outcome invites caution with respect to the generalisability of the claim that CDS facilitates language development across the breadth of input domains and learning outcomes. Future research ought to resolve the discrepancy between sweeping claims about the function of CDS as facilitating language development on the one hand and the narrow evidence base for such a claim on the other by conducting CDS-ADS comparisons across a wider range of input features and outcome measures."

Weststrate","Intergenerational relationships have been established as a critical locus of psychosocial development, meeting needs of identity development for youth, generativity for elders, and connection and belonging for both. However, intergenerational relationships are both rare in the LGBTQ+ community and sorely needed as a buffer to the discrimination and harm that those within the community experience from systemic and structural oppression. Focusing on sexual identity, and employing a letter writing paradigm, we investigated the content of wisdom that LGB elders have to share with youth. In a descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods, and pre-registered study, 94 adults ranging in age 50 to 79 years (M = 55.98; SD = 6.30) wrote letters to a fictional youth, Sam, as well as completed surveys of psychosocial development and well-being. Letters were content coded for themes, as well as for emotional tone and subjective perspective.  The most common themes of wisdom shared included knowing and celebrating oneself, negotiating an oppressive society, and finding one’s community. Those who wrote more emotionally positive letters scored higher on measures of wisdom and generativity, and lower on embitterment. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of cultivating opportunities for wisdom-sharing within LGBTQ+ communities to promote flourishing across the lifespan."

Contrary to common assumptions, absolute contraindications to exposure therapy are very rare, since an adaptation to assumed contraindications is possible in the vast majority of cases (e.g., graduated approach, change of exercise focus, creative exercise design). New approaches to exposure move away from the imperative necessity of ""habituation"" and instead emphasize the role of threat expectancy violation and change. When planning and conducting exposure, a hypothetical ""ideal exercise"" should first be developed which have the maximal potential to violate the individual core threat expectancy as much as possible. In a next step, the best possible ""optimal exercise"" can be conducted, based on the willingness of the patient and feasibility. By setting the focus of exposure, special emphasis can be placed on habituation, threat expectancy violation, or other helpful experiences. Recent studies on this approach to exposure in anxiety disorders showed very high and sustainable treatment success and provided evidence for the role of threat expectancy change as a mechanism underlying exposure.    [Kaum eine psychotherapeutische Intervention ist so breit einsetzbar wie Exposition. Absolute Kontraindikationen für Expositionstherapie liegen entgegen häufiger Annahmen nur sehr selten vor, da eine Anpassung an vermeintliche Kontraindikatoren in den allermeisten Fällen möglich ist (z.B. graduiertes Vorgehen, Wechsel des Übungsfokus, kreative Übungsgestaltung). Neue Ansätze der Exposition entfernen sich von der zwingenden Notwendigkeit der „Habituation“ und betonen stattdessen die Rolle der Befürchtungswiderlegung und -veränderung. Bei der Planung und Durchführung einer Exposition sollten Therapeuten*innen hierbei zunächst eine hypothetische „ideale Übung“ erarbeiten, mit der Betroffene ihre zentrale Befürchtung maximal widerlegen könnten. Im nächsten Schritt erfolgt dann die Vorbereitung und Durchführung einer realisierbaren, patient*innennahen „optimalen Übung“. Durch die Festlegung des Übungsfokus können Habituation, Befürchtungswiderlegung oder andere Lernerfahrungen in den Vordergrund gestellt werden. Aktuelle Studien zur befürchtungszentrierten Exposition belegen eine sehr hohe und nachhaltige Wirksamkeit sowie die Rolle der Befürchtungsveränderung als Wirkprozess."

We characterized the chromatic statistics of the ‘visual diets’ of people living in remote rainforest and urban environments, by randomly sampling images using calibrated head-mounted cameras as participants went about daily lives. All environments, as is typical for natural scenes, had chromatic distributions with most variance along a roughly blue-yellow axis, but the extent of this bias differed across locations. If color perception and aesthetics are calibrated to the visual environments in which participants are currently immersed, variation in the extent of the bias in scene statistics should have a corresponding impact on perception and aesthetic judgements. To test this, we measured color discrimination and preferences for distributions of color for people living in the different environments. Group differences in the extent of blue-yellow bias in color discrimination were in the opposite direction to that predicted by the differences in scene statistics under an efficient coding framework, but were consistent with perceptual learning in local environments. Preferences for color distributions aligned with scene statistics, but not specifically to local environments, and one group preferred color distributions along an unnatural color axis orthogonal to that dominant in natural scenes.  These preferences could be explained by an interaction of culture and perceptual fluency.  Our study shows the benefits of conducting psychophysics with people at remote locations for understanding the commonalities and diversity in human perception."

We compared this to the activity during the same trial length, in a group of participants who did not learn a target location and navigated freely but were time-matched to the learning group (non-learning, n=15). We compared relative power in Delta (2-4 Hz), Theta (5-7 Hz), Alpha (8-12 Hz), Beta (15-29 Hz) &amp; Gamma (30-40 Hz) bands across the scalp. We found that delta and theta activity were greater during recall in our learning group, as opposed to our non-learning group. We also demonstrated clear suppression in the alpha band at posterior sites during memory-guided navigation compared to our non-learning group. Additionally, when goal-directed navigation switches to focused searching behaviour, power becomes greater at the frontal region; with increases in the delta and theta bands reflecting this strategy change. There was also greater beta and gamma activity at posterior sites in our learning group. We discuss the results further in terms of the possible roles and functions of these oscillations during human navigation and hope this exploratory analysis can provide hypotheses for future spatial navigation and memory work."

The theory concludes that such asymmetric punishment would result in hygiene norms becoming ever stricter. We argue that, because complaints about one’s behavior might lead to protest, norms might not always change because of such complaints. We conducted an online experiment (N = 1023 Swiss adults) using handwashing as the target behavior. We replicated the asymmetry in punishment intensities and found that the intensity of protests against complaints about one’s too unhygienic behavior approached the intensity of these complaints. We conclude that, while asymmetric punishment may drive norm change, protests may lead to norm stability."

One speech feature that shares overlapping acoustic dimensions with music is lexical tone. However, lexical tones usually pose challenges for L2 learners with non-tonal native languages in learning tonal words, especially without explicit instructions, due to the absence of tonal cues in their phonological representations. One hypothesis based on cross-domain transfer between music and language is that better musical aptitude may modulate this tonal difficulty. This study tested this hypothesis by exploring whether and how music-to-language transfer facilitates L2 tonal word learning. We adopted a cross-situational word learning paradigm (CSWL) to test whether non-tonal language speakers could acquire tonal words without explicit instructions. Findings suggest that non-tonal speakers can use fine acoustic cues to learn tonal words by keeping track of cross-situational statistics and that musical aptitude (melodic perceptual ability) relates to tonal word learning for non-tonal speakers. Moreover, non-tonal learners could develop different levels of awareness regarding the pitch and duration of lexical tones, and awareness of acoustic cues could also predict non-tonal learners’ performance in CSWL."

Yet in Singapore, older adults are unlikely to seek help for their mental health from their primary care providers. This qualitative study explores how late-life depression manifests to general practitioners (GPs) in the Singaporean primary care setting. Methods Twenty-eight private GPs practicing in Singapore were asked about their clinical experience with late-life depression during semi-structured group and individual discussions conducted online. Participants were purposively sampled across age, gender, and ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian). Transcripts were analysed with reflexive thematic analysis. Findings To GPs, depression in older patients often manifests through somatic symptoms or subtle behavioural changes, only detectable through follow-ups or collateral history. GPs reported that older patients attribute depressive symptoms to normal ageing or do not mention them, particularly within an Asian culture further encouraging stoic endurance. GPs perceived late-life depression as reactions to ageing-related stressors, with male, low-income, or institutionalised patients being at particular risk of insidious, severe depression. GPs noted ethnic differences regarding families’ involvement in care, which they described as helpful, but sometimes stress-provoking for patients. Fear of burdensomeness or loss of autonomy/social role could prompt rejection of diagnosis and treatment in patients. GPs considered good patient-doctor rapport as a facilitator at every step of the care process, noting more favourable prognosis in care-concordant patients. Interpretation Depression in older adults in Singapore can be covert, with successful management relying on GPs’ ability to pick up on subtle changes, assess patients holistically, and build rapport with patients and families."

We found that delta and theta activity were greater during recall in our learning group, as opposed to our non-learning group. We also demonstrated clear suppression in the alpha band at posterior sites during memory-guided navigation compared to our non-learning group. Additionally, when goal-directed navigation switches to focused searching behaviour, power becomes greater at the frontal region; with increases in the delta and theta bands reflecting this strategy change. There was also greater beta and gamma activity at posterior sites in our learning group. We discuss the results further in terms of the possible roles and functions of these oscillations during human navigation and hope this exploratory analysis can provide hypotheses for future spatial navigation and memory work."

One speech feature that shares overlapping acoustic dimensions with music is lexical tone. However, lexical tones usually pose challenges for L2 learners with non-tonal native languages in learning tonal words, especially without explicit instructions, due to the absence of tonal cues in their phonological representations. One hypothesis based on cross-domain transfer between music and language is that better musical aptitude may modulate this tonal difficulty. This study tested this hypothesis by exploring whether and how music-to-language transfer facilitates L2 tonal word learning. We adopted a cross-situational word learning paradigm (CSWL) to test whether non-tonal language speakers could acquire tonal words without explicit instructions. Findings suggest that non-tonal speakers can use fine acoustic cues to learn tonal words by keeping track of cross-situational statistics and that musical aptitude (melodic perceptual ability) relates to tonal word learning for non-tonal speakers. Moreover, non-tonal learners could develop different levels of awareness regarding the pitch and duration of lexical tones, and awareness of acoustic cues could also predict non-tonal learners’ performance in CSWL."

We characterized the chromatic statistics of the ‘visual diets’ of people living in remote rainforest and urban environments, by randomly sampling images using calibrated head-mounted cameras as participants went about daily lives. All environments, as is typical for natural scenes, had chromatic distributions with most variance along a roughly blue-yellow axis, but the extent of this bias differed across locations. If color perception and aesthetics are calibrated to the visual environments in which participants are currently immersed, variation in the extent of the bias in scene statistics should have a corresponding impact on perception and aesthetic judgements. To test this, we measured color discrimination and preferences for distributions of color for people living in the different environments. Group differences in the extent of blue-yellow bias in color discrimination were in the opposite direction to that predicted by the differences in scene statistics under an efficient coding framework, but were consistent with perceptual learning in local environments. Preferences for color distributions aligned with scene statistics, but not specifically to local environments, and one group preferred color distributions along an unnatural color axis orthogonal to that dominant in natural scenes.  These preferences could be explained by an interaction of culture and perceptual fluency.  Our study shows the benefits of conducting psychophysics with people at remote locations for understanding the commonalities and diversity in human perception."

Yet in Singapore, older adults are unlikely to seek help for their mental health from their primary care providers. This qualitative study explores how late-life depression manifests to general practitioners (GPs) in the Singaporean primary care setting. Methods Twenty-eight private GPs practicing in Singapore were asked about their clinical experience with late-life depression during semi-structured group and individual discussions conducted online. Participants were purposively sampled across age, gender, and ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian). Transcripts were analysed with reflexive thematic analysis. Findings To GPs, depression in older patients often manifests through somatic symptoms or subtle behavioural changes, only detectable through follow-ups or collateral history. GPs reported that older patients attribute depressive symptoms to normal ageing or do not mention them, particularly within an Asian culture further encouraging stoic endurance. GPs perceived late-life depression as reactions to ageing-related stressors, with male, low-income, or institutionalised patients being at particular risk of insidious, severe depression. GPs noted ethnic differences regarding families’ involvement in care, which they described as helpful, but sometimes stress-provoking for patients. Fear of burdensomeness or loss of autonomy/social role could prompt rejection of diagnosis and treatment in patients. GPs considered good patient-doctor rapport as a facilitator at every step of the care process, noting more favourable prognosis in care-concordant patients. Interpretation Depression in older adults in Singapore can be covert, with successful management relying on GPs’ ability to pick up on subtle changes, assess patients holistically, and build rapport with patients and families."

Comparing complaints and protests against complaints,"Robert Tobias, Lisa Frisch, Simone Sebben, Johannes Ullrich","We test a general theory of norm changes based on evidence that people will punish less hygienic others more strongly than more hygienic others. The theory concludes that such asymmetric punishment would result in hygiene norms becoming ever stricter. We argue that, because complaints about one’s behavior might lead to protest, norms might not always change because of such complaints. We conducted an online experiment (N = 1023 Swiss adults) using handwashing as the target behavior. We replicated the asymmetry in punishment intensities and found that the intensity of protests against complaints about one’s too unhygienic behavior approached the intensity of these complaints. We conclude that, while asymmetric punishment may drive norm change, protests may lead to norm stability."

A total of 1,541 children (including 663 ADHD and 878 TD) were assessed on measures of the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and reading-related tasks. The results suggested that denser ADHD symptoms and reading networks with stronger global connectivity were observed in the ADHD group compared to the TD group. Age from ten to twelve was found to be a potentiate critical stage of the development of ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, the current study emphasizes the significance of word reading for other reading-related abilities in children with ADHD. It also highlights the central role of inattention symptoms in reading networks of school-age children. These findings may provide insight for future diagnostic systems."

Contrary to common assumptions, absolute contraindications to exposure therapy are very rare, since an adaptation to assumed contraindications is possible in the vast majority of cases (e.g., graduated approach, change of exercise focus, creative exercise design). New approaches to exposure move away from the imperative necessity of ""habituation"" and instead emphasize the role of threat expectancy violation and change. When planning and conducting exposure, a hypothetical ""ideal exercise"" should first be developed which have the maximal potential to violate the individual core threat expectancy as much as possible. In a next step, the best possible ""optimal exercise"" can be conducted, based on the willingness of the patient and feasibility. By setting the focus of exposure, special emphasis can be placed on habituation, threat expectancy violation, or other helpful experiences. Recent studies on this approach to exposure in anxiety disorders showed very high and sustainable treatment success and provided evidence for the role of threat expectancy change as a mechanism underlying exposure.    [Kaum eine psychotherapeutische Intervention ist so breit einsetzbar wie Exposition. Absolute Kontraindikationen für Expositionstherapie liegen entgegen häufiger Annahmen nur sehr selten vor, da eine Anpassung an vermeintliche Kontraindikatoren in den allermeisten Fällen möglich ist (z.B. graduiertes Vorgehen, Wechsel des Übungsfokus, kreative Übungsgestaltung). Neue Ansätze der Exposition entfernen sich von der zwingenden Notwendigkeit der „Habituation“ und betonen stattdessen die Rolle der Befürchtungswiderlegung und -veränderung. Bei der Planung und Durchführung einer Exposition sollten Therapeuten*innen hierbei zunächst eine hypothetische „ideale Übung“ erarbeiten, mit der Betroffene ihre zentrale Befürchtung maximal widerlegen könnten. Im nächsten Schritt erfolgt dann die Vorbereitung und Durchführung einer realisierbaren, patient*innennahen „optimalen Übung“. Durch die Festlegung des Übungsfokus können Habituation, Befürchtungswiderlegung oder andere Lernerfahrungen in den Vordergrund gestellt werden. Aktuelle Studien zur befürchtungszentrierten Exposition belegen eine sehr hohe und nachhaltige Wirksamkeit sowie die Rolle der Befürchtungsveränderung als Wirkprozess."

This study investigated the relationship between metacognition and trait mindfulness in healthy older adults, specifically examining metacognitive efficiency in memory and emotion recognition. Methods: Mindfulness was measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form (FFMQ-SF) while metacognitive efficiency across memory and emotion was captured using participants’ level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance. Results: Partial correlation analyses revealed distinct significant associations. The observing facet of the FFMQ-SF was linked to memory-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .28, p &lt;.006), while the describing facet correlated with emotion-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .29, p =.004). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between the total mindfulness score and both memory and emotion-related metacognitive efficiency. Conclusions: These findings underscore the psychometric characteristics inherent in the FFMQ-SF and their potential significance for shaping mindfulness-focused interventions. Further research is warranted to clarify the unique contributions of mindfulness regarding its capacity to improve metacognitive efficiency in older adults."

Methods: This study aimed to assess AB in individuals with a history of substance dependence, specifically heroin users, utilizing Lavie's cognitive load theory (1995). Participants were categorized into a treatment group (TG), an abstinent group (AG), and a non-consumer group (NCG). An attentional task was designed based on Lavie's model, involving discriminating target letters (X or N) presented alone (low cognitive load, LCL), or among other letters (high cognitive load, HCL).  Results: According to Lavie's model (1995), it was anticipated that in the TG and AG groups, compared to the NCG, AB would manifest only in the LCL condition. No significant differences were found regarding AB towards consumption-related images (i.e., emotional images) compared to neutral stimuli in the LCL condition.  Conclusion: Our study did not find statistically significant results concerning AB between the TG and the AG when compared to the NCG. These findings contradict a significant body of research investigating selective attention in individuals with addiction, which consistently observed AB within this population."

Evidence that conflict adaptation can transcend contexts early in childhood.,To be fetched,"*This manuscript is not yet published* Developing the ability to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant information is crucial for navigating an ever-changing environment. This skill, cognitive control, can be studied using conflict tasks in which the relevant and irrelevant information in a trial either align or compete (congruency). Performance in these tasks can be affected not only by the current trial’s congruency but also by the previous trial’s congruency. In adults, this conflict adaptation has been reported to occur between trials of the same task and different tasks. The goal of this study was to study the development and flexibility of cognitive control by assessing conflict adaptation across different age groups and contexts. Two groups of children (aged 6 and 9 years) and one group of adults processed adaptations of the Stroop and Simon tasks and the resulting mouse-tracking variables (total movement time, initiation time, maximum absolute deviation values) were analysed. Across three experiments different context similarities were created depending on which tasks were combined. The results indicate that within-task conflict adaptation does not change qualitatively between 6-year-olds and adults. In contrast, across-task conflict adaptation does. Of note, transfer effects across very different contexts were observed in the youngest group of children, suggesting remarkable flexibility of cognitive control even early in development."

Industry actors and policymakers, while generally aware of the problem, have been reluctant to counter such communication, in part out of concern for players’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy online. However, these attitudes reveal flawed assumptions about how the human rights to privacy and freedom of expression apply in the online context. These rights are invoked to shield purveyors of hostile and exclusionary rhetoric from accountability, even as their speech serves to prevent the targets of hostility from enjoying their rights to expression, privacy, and freedom from harm. This paper argues that the human rights of victims of harassment and extremist violence should be weighed more heavily when designing policies that may abridge players’ freedom of expression and privacy interests. Industry actors need to counter more effectively the prevalence of hateful and extremist expression, even if doing so requires adjusting players’ expectations of privacy and freedom of speech. Lawmakers and regulators also have a role to play in changing the perception of gaming spaces as black boxes free from external scrutiny. They can do so by exercising adequate oversight of the game industry and striving for a better balance between the demands for free speech and privacy rights online, on the one hand, and the need to protect the human rights of victims of harassment and violence, on the other."

Yet, phonological skills in DD of Chinese, a logographic writing system, have rarely been systematically investigated. The present study aimed to systematically investigate PA, RAN, and VSTM deficits in Chinese children with DD. Method: We compared 128 three and fourth grade Mandarin-speaking Chinese children with DD aged between 8 and 11 years (Mean age = 9.4 years, 73 male) and 135 age-matched controls on 7 phonological tasks, including 3 PA tasks (phoneme deletion, onset rime deletion, and spoonerism), 3 RAN tasks (digit, object, and color), and a VSTM task (digit span). A combination of logistic regression analysis and a machine learning approach with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were employed for data analyses.  Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that similar to results from DD in six European languages by Landerl and Ramus et al. (2013), phoneme deletion and RAN digits played major roles in predicting Chinese DD, while digit span played a minor role. SHAP analysis revealed that the most effective predictor tasks for Chinese DD are RAN pictures, phoneme deletion, and spoonerism. Conclusion: The results suggest important roles of RAN and PA and a minor role of VSTM in predicting Chinese DD.  Findings have important implications for the diagnosis and remediation of Chinese DD."

Conversely, in scale-free networks representing complex social structures (Experiment 2), 1-ToM agents emerge as thriving social hubs, highlighting the efficiency of simpler cognitive strategies in complex environments. The findings contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary pressures shaping social cognition and offer insights into optimizing cognitive strategies for social interaction and leadership in complex social landscapes."

Yet, phonological skills in DD of Chinese, a logographic writing system, have rarely been systematically investigated. The present study aimed to systematically investigate PA, RAN, and VSTM deficits in Chinese children with DD. Method: We compared 128 three and fourth grade Mandarin-speaking Chinese children with DD aged between 8 and 11 years (Mean age = 9.4 years, 73 male) and 135 age-matched controls on 7 phonological tasks, including 3 PA tasks (phoneme deletion, onset rime deletion, and spoonerism), 3 RAN tasks (digit, object, and color), and a VSTM task (digit span). A combination of logistic regression analysis and a machine learning approach with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were employed for data analyses.  Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that similar to results from DD in six European languages by Landerl and Ramus et al. (2013), phoneme deletion and RAN digits played major roles in predicting Chinese DD, while digit span played a minor role. SHAP analysis revealed that the most effective predictor tasks for Chinese DD are RAN pictures, phoneme deletion, and spoonerism. Conclusion: The results suggest important roles of RAN and PA and a minor role of VSTM in predicting Chinese DD.  Findings have important implications for the diagnosis and remediation of Chinese DD."

Methods: This study aimed to assess AB in individuals with a history of substance dependence, specifically heroin users, utilizing Lavie's cognitive load theory (1995). Participants were categorized into a treatment group (TG), an abstinent group (AG), and a non-consumer group (NCG). An attentional task was designed based on Lavie's model, involving discriminating target letters (X or N) presented alone (low cognitive load, LCL), or among other letters (high cognitive load, HCL).  Results: According to Lavie's model (1995), it was anticipated that in the TG and AG groups, compared to the NCG, AB would manifest only in the LCL condition. No significant differences were found regarding AB towards consumption-related images (i.e., emotional images) compared to neutral stimuli in the LCL condition.  Conclusion: Our study did not find statistically significant results concerning AB between the TG and the AG when compared to the NCG. These findings contradict a significant body of research investigating selective attention in individuals with addiction, which consistently observed AB within this population."

(2023) argued for the gamification of behavioural sciences, where the intrinsic motivations and reward structures associated with games are implemented to improve the quality and quantity of human data. A complementary approach is also available, where commercially available games are studied for their hidden scientific content. Here the goal is not the ‘gamification of science’ but rather the ‘scientification of games.’ This approach asks whether naturalistic data related to the cognitive architecture of human behaviour can be found within games designed for commercial rather than scientific use, and considers if the ground truth of behaviour and cognition may be better revealed by treating individuals not as ‘study participants’ but rather ‘game players.’"

Clayton Young, Valentina Diaz, Joel Kramer, Winston Chiong","Objectives: Deficits in metacognitive efficiency have been associated with risky decision-making and vulnerability to financial abuse in older individuals. This study investigated the relationship between metacognition and trait mindfulness in healthy older adults, specifically examining metacognitive efficiency in memory and emotion recognition. Methods: Mindfulness was measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form (FFMQ-SF) while metacognitive efficiency across memory and emotion was captured using participants’ level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance. Results: Partial correlation analyses revealed distinct significant associations. The observing facet of the FFMQ-SF was linked to memory-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .28, p &lt;.006), while the describing facet correlated with emotion-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .29, p =.004). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between the total mindfulness score and both memory and emotion-related metacognitive efficiency. Conclusions: These findings underscore the psychometric characteristics inherent in the FFMQ-SF and their potential significance for shaping mindfulness-focused interventions. Further research is warranted to clarify the unique contributions of mindfulness regarding its capacity to improve metacognitive efficiency in older adults."

However, it is not clear how this purportedly transdiagnostic core vulnerability is associated with internalizing psychopathology at the symptom level. Using a newly developed measure of this transdiagnostic core vulnerability, we aimed to identify which internalizing symptoms were most relevant to the core vulnerability.  Methods: We fit an undirected network model composed of 36 internalizing symptoms nodes, four subscale nodes, and one node representing the core vulnerability to cross-sectional data obtained from 907 university students.  Results: The core vulnerability was found to be transdiagnostic in that it was associated with symptoms spanning the different forms of internalizing psychopathology. Importantly, the core vulnerability was differentially associated with these symptoms. Of the various affective, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms analyzed, the core vulnerability only demonstrated direct and prominent associations with cognition-related internalizing symptoms. These associations varied in potency, with the symptom of feeling like a failure displaying the strongest association with the core vulnerability. Limitations: The cross-sectional data used here prevents us from disentangling the between- and within-person effects for any given conditional association in our network. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of conducting symptom-focused investigations of the interface between the transdiagnostic core vulnerability construct and internalizing psychopathology. Further research could potentially uncover the core symptomatic manifestations of the core vulnerability that might serve as suitable candidates for clinical intervention."

Based on the points raised in the commentary, we can conclude that it is very unlikely that rTMS, the way utilized by the authors, can improve hypnotizability. If the effect does exist, it is inconsequentially small, and is very likely to be due to experimental biases introduced by the ineffective blinding procedure, rather than the inhibitory stimulation proposed by the authors."

Under standard accounts, such scalar implicatures are derived by negating stronger alternatives. Research has shown that in online processing, weaker scale-mates ('warm') prime stronger ones ('hot'), suggesting that the latter are used in implicature processing (De Carvalho et al, 2016; Ronai &amp; Xiang, 2023). We test different theories of scalar implicature processing by examining whether priming holds when no implicature is expected to arise. This is crucial to know whether and what kinds of alternatives form the basis of scalar implicature computation. We first focused on sentences with negation and asked whether 'hot' is primed when comprehenders are exposed to sentences containing 'not warm'. Then, we tested antonyms, such as 'cool', which are assumed to be on a separate scale. Lastly, we tested negated antonyms (i.e., 'not cool'). As a control, we also ran an experiment with isolated antonym words without any sentential context. In line with theoretical accounts (Horn, 1972), negated scale-mates did not prime strong ones. Contrary to these accounts, however, antonyms primed the target words ('hot'). Negation seems to have also cancelled the activation of targets for antonymic primes. In a joint analysis of our sentential experiments with the addition of the data from Ronai &amp; Xiang (2023), which tested the priming by non-negated scale-mates, we found that negation interacted with both scale-mate primes and antonym primes.

Equipped with a variety of sensory-engaging equipment and materials, these rooms aim to facilitate relaxation, emotional regulation, and sensory integration. However, the specific relaxation techniques and essential elements required to create effective, calming spaces for autistic adults remain poorly understood. This study seeks to bridge this gap by investigating the unique sensory preferences and needs of autistic adults, with the objective of informing sensory room designs to better accommodate their specific requirements.  Methods: An online mixed-methods survey, divided into three parts, was conducted. Part One utilised the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-50) to screen for autistic traits and participants scoring above the threshold of 25 were invited for further studies. Part Two 1comprised a survey incorporating open-ended and closed questions to assess participants' sensory and relaxation preferences. Part Three also used an online survey and targeted individuals with prior sensory room exposure to assess their experiences. Qualitative results were analysed using thematic analysis.  Results: Of the 150 participants screened in Part One, 96 and 13 participants completed Part Two and Three, respectively. Results of the study found that whilst general themes can be identified, autistic adults use a diverse range of methods and sensory modulation techniques to facilitate relaxation. When asked about preferred relaxation activities, themes such as the use of active or passive media arose, as did spending time outdoors, in solitude, or engaging in creative activities. However, there was a considerable amount of diversity between participants regarding how they chose to interact with the items that comprise each theme. In terms of specific sensory modalities, visual, auditory, and somatosensory were identified as the primary senses that can affect relaxation, particularly through customised lighting or sounds, however, these preferences were highly person specific.  Conclusions: Our findings emphasise the importance of taking an individualized approach when designing calming spaces for this demographic. The study reveals a wide range of methods autistic adults use to self-regulate, spanning customized environmental changes, sensory stimulation, nature, media engagement, and internal coping strategies. Additionally, suggestions for improving existing spaces focus on increasing personalization and control to better meet individual sensory needs."

In recent years, archaeologists have provided substantial evidence for the remarkable time-depth of symbolic artifact utilization and have made groundbreaking methodological advances (e.g, with respect to dating techniques, microscopy and 3d modeling). However, a systematic and rigorous framework for the investigation of the symbolic function of past artifacts is still lacking, that is, what kind of purpose these tools may have served and what kind of symbolic work they were designed or co- opted to do. This paper responds to this lacuna and outlines a new conceptual framework for the investigation of early symbolic artifacts. Symbolic artifacts are special in the sense of being mind- directed as they do their work primarily in the social and cognitive domain. That is, they support their function only to the extent that their structural properties affect relevant cognitive processes related to symbolic cognition (including e.g., attention, memory, and discrimination). To inform our understanding of past symbolic behavior, we therefore introduce the concept of cognitive affordances, defined as the capacity of symbolic forms to support such relevant cognitive processes. The cognitive affordances constitute a mediating layer of analysis between the observable, structural traits of symbolic artifacts and their hypothesized role in past social and pragmatic behaviors of hominins, related to, for instance, aesthetic, communicative, or ritual/cosmological practices. We show that by studying the cognitive implications of variation and change in the structural properties of symbolic artifacts recovered from the archaeological record, we can inform inferences and test new hypotheses about what pragmatic functions they may have served in past Paleolithic society."

That is, they support their function only to the extent that their structural properties affect relevant cognitive processes related to symbolic cognition (including e.g., attention, memory, and discrimination). To inform our understanding of past symbolic behavior, we therefore introduce the concept of cognitive affordances, defined as the capacity of symbolic forms to support such relevant cognitive processes. The cognitive affordances constitute a mediating layer of analysis between the observable, structural traits of symbolic artifacts and their hypothesized role in past social and pragmatic behaviors of hominins, related to, for instance, aesthetic, communicative, or ritual/cosmological practices. We show that by studying the cognitive implications of variation and change in the structural properties of symbolic artifacts recovered from the archaeological record, we can inform inferences and test new hypotheses about what pragmatic functions they may have served in past Paleolithic society."

Our manuscript lists concerns regarding the reliability of the data published in the paper, in the existence of the effect, and in the robustness and reproducibility of the findings. Based on the points raised in the commentary, we can conclude that it is very unlikely that rTMS, the way utilized by the authors, can improve hypnotizability. If the effect does exist, it is inconsequentially small, and is very likely to be due to experimental biases introduced by the ineffective blinding procedure, rather than the inhibitory stimulation proposed by the authors."

Hong","Background: Recent research has sought to study how the overlapping features of extant cognitive vulnerabilities might serve as a general risk factor for internalizing psychopathology. However, it is not clear how this purportedly transdiagnostic core vulnerability is associated with internalizing psychopathology at the symptom level. Using a newly developed measure of this transdiagnostic core vulnerability, we aimed to identify which internalizing symptoms were most relevant to the core vulnerability.  Methods: We fit an undirected network model composed of 36 internalizing symptoms nodes, four subscale nodes, and one node representing the core vulnerability to cross-sectional data obtained from 907 university students.  Results: The core vulnerability was found to be transdiagnostic in that it was associated with symptoms spanning the different forms of internalizing psychopathology. Importantly, the core vulnerability was differentially associated with these symptoms. Of the various affective, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms analyzed, the core vulnerability only demonstrated direct and prominent associations with cognition-related internalizing symptoms. These associations varied in potency, with the symptom of feeling like a failure displaying the strongest association with the core vulnerability. Limitations: The cross-sectional data used here prevents us from disentangling the between- and within-person effects for any given conditional association in our network. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of conducting symptom-focused investigations of the interface between the transdiagnostic core vulnerability construct and internalizing psychopathology. Further research could potentially uncover the core symptomatic manifestations of the core vulnerability that might serve as suitable candidates for clinical intervention."

In this experimental study, we examined the effects of news exposure on emotional states. Participants (N=128) were randomly assigned to positive or negative news exposure conditions, completed pre-test and post-test measures of emotions, and were asked about their willingness to read more. There were large effects of negative news on emotions, and a medium effect of positive news. Negative news had the greatest effects on sickening people, increasing anger, and reducing happiness and enjoyment. Positive news had the most improvements on nervousness, worry, and loneliness. Both groups nonetheless showed the same willingness to read more. News consumption may readily impact emotions, with negative news having more powerful effects than positive news. These findings bring attention to problematic news consumption and the importance of self-regulation and digital literacy. In conclusion, this study, which lies at the intersection of journalism, communication, and the psychology of social media and emotion, examined the effects of news media on emotions using an experimental approach that can be easily implemented by interdisciplinary researchers in an emerging field of “affective news”."

While contemporary research on this topic originated in the USA and Europe, it is now expanding in China, India, and South Korea. Scholars are proposing novel frameworks and assessment tools, yet the primary challenge remains establishing a shared understanding of this phenomenon. Studies indicate that despite different perspectives, all approaches converge on the notion of meaningfulness that a sense of calling infuses into work and life. However, unresolved inquiries persist regarding the origin of one's calling, its altruistic nature, the influence of religion, and other dimensions. Despite the complexities in defining a unified concept, it's evident that a calling significantly influences both work and overall life. On one hand, it enhances work and life satisfaction, alleviates stress and burnout, and aids in career and life decisions. Conversely, it may expose individuals to exploitation by employers, necessitate sacrifices in other life domains, and lead to regrets if implementation proves impractical. The primary aim of this article is to prompt Russian psychology scholars to study the phenomenon of life calling, fostering research that places it within the broader contexts of meaning, choice, and self-actualization."

It also decreases work performance and affects employers through increased absenteeism and employee turnover. Mindfulness intervention is the most reported intervention for burnout and has been found to offer statistically significant effects in improving stress levels and reducing burnout. Recent research has examined focused meditation, a particular type of mindfulness training, and the role of its effects of attentional regulation and emotion regulation in reducing stress and burnout. Studies will be included which have participants working in high-risk areas including emergency services, the military, corporate executive management or healthcare workers who participated in a meditation intervention prior to the onset of burnout. Psychological outcomes, including Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM), Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Bergen Burnout Inventory (BBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and physiological outcomes including cortisol levels, heart rate variability, blood pressure, stress reactivity, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the meditation intervention.

The central challenge in the study of ecological grief is that its theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. Recent discussions in philosophy of emotions elucidate that a central element in this theoretical challenge is determining what the object of ecological grief is. In turn, our understanding of the object of ecological grief goes hand in hand with our understanding of the nature of ecological grief. This paper develops a phenomenological analysis of cross-cultural subjective reports that identifies crucial themes in the experience of ecological grief. This phenomenological analysis reveals the object of ecological grief as the loss of the life possibilities that are sustained by dwelling. The resulting view is that ecological grief corresponds to a crisis in dwelling — a disturbance in the very way we inhabit our home environment."

Therefore, it is important to understand and manage workplace stress, but that is not simple or straightforward.

First, we identify and highlight three factors that mitigate decisions under stress conditions: decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors. Second, we situate workplace stress in forensic science within the Challenge-Hindrance Stress Framework. We argue that stressors in forensic science workplaces can have a positive or a negative impact, depending on the type, level, and context of stress. Developing an understanding of the stressors, their sources, and their possible impact, can help forensic service providers and researchers to implement context-specific interventions to manage stress at work and optimize expert performance."

An Appendix provides the relevant text from both Bohr’s Nobel biography and his interview with the American Institute of Physics to support this conclusion.  Bohr’s description of significant events in his life are matched with dates in his Nobel biography, adding support to the conclusion.  How Bohr specifically adapted James’s complementarity to physics is presented.  Bohr’s discussion of “mental activity” is compared here to James’s definition of complementarity focusing on consciousness and is found to be extremely similar to James’s definition.  In addition, a side by side comparison of James’s definition of complementarity and Bohr’s most important and well-known definition of complementarity for physics is presented.  This comparison shows just how Bohr adapted James’s complementarity to Bohr’s complementarity for physics.  Examining the chapters “The Stream of Thought”” (chapter 9 in James’s “The Principles of Psychology”) and “The Relation of Minds to Other Things” (chapter 8 in “The Principles of Psychology”) shows that the very evidence that James used to develop complementarity in “The Relation of Minds to Other Things” is discussed in “The Stream of Thought,” a chapter that Bohr acknowledged reading and concerning which he had a very high opinion.  It is also made clear in the paper that Bohr was aware that he had a choice to adopt complementarity for physics along the lines of James’s complementarity, which he had read, and that he rejected this possibility.  Instead, in his complementarity for physics, Bohr adopted a very different approach fundamentally based on the necessity of a physical interaction between a physical system and a physical measuring apparatus with an uncontrolled aspect to obtain a specific measurement result.  Bohr attempted to apply the uncertainty principle to this uncontrolled feature of the physical interaction.  Bohr’s approach has been the widely adopted framework for understanding quantum measurement since 1927.  The historical description of complementarity in Bohr’s Nobel biography is discussed in light of the evidence presented and is shown to be incorrect.  It is important to set the record straight regarding the origin of complementarity so that James’s complementarity is not seen as an appendage of Bohr’s version of complementarity for physics.  Bohr’s attempt to extrapolate what his Nobel biography incorrectly states was complementarity originally developed by Bohr, which was for physics, to other fields confuses and detracts from the importance of James’s complementarity which was in fact the original.

Behavioral IPS has been studied increasingly in various contexts, such as a feature of the social interaction difficulties inherent to autism. To fully understand the dynamics of behavioral IPS, or reductions thereof in autism, the neural basis of IPS perception needs to be established, as it is an arguably essential ingredient to achieve IPS when engaging in social interactions. Thus, the current study’s aim was twofold: to establish the basic neuro-perceptual processing of IPS in typical observers and to test whether it might differ in autistic individuals. In a task-based fMRI paradigm, participants viewed short, silent video vignettes of humans during social interactions featuring a variation of behavioral IPS. The results show that IPS modulates the Action Observation Network. Interestingly, autistic participants showed the same IPS modulation of neural activation patterns as non-autistic participants, suggesting that IPS perception is spared and likely not underlying reduced behavioral IPS in autism. Nevertheless, a general difference of processing social interactions was found in autistic observers characterized by decreased neural activation in the right middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, and superior temporal areas. This may implicate frontoparietal regions as a source of attenuation for integrating top-down modulation during social interactions. As such, the attenuated production of behavioral IPS and subsequently social interaction difficulties in autism may not stem from differences in perceiving the timing of other’s behavior, but rather from altered integration thereof into the temporal coordination of behavior when interacting with others."

Here we introduce Synch.Live, a participatory behavioural science experiment for quantitatively studying collective motion in humans, framed as a game with an unspecified task and a group feedback mechanism, that can be solved through cooperation by 10 participants moving together. More than half of the groups participating in the experiment succeeded in achieving flocking motion, and winning players showed higher connectedness to others compared to those who failed. Furthermore, individuals with an awareness of working strategies were more likely to be part of winning groups, suggesting the importance of individual contributions to the collective task. This work demonstrates that solving an unspecified group challenge in response to group feedback is possible, and moreover, that flock-like collective movement has the potential to yield social benefits and well-being, suggesting new directions for exploring social aspects of consciousness and cognition."

Specifically, we examine how a scientific education curriculum—Scientific Creativity in Practice (SCIP) program—impacts the semantic memory networks of 10–18-year-old students in a chemistry class (n = 176). Students in an Intervention group who received the SCIP intervention, and a Control group who did not, completed creative thinking tests, as well as verbal fluency tasks to estimate semantic networks in science-specific (chemistry) and domain-general (animal) categories. Results showed that the SCIP intervention significantly improved fluency scores on a general creative thinking test. Using network science methods, we observed increased interconnectedness in both science-specific and domain-general categories, with lower path distances between concepts and reduced modularity. These traits define a ‘small-world’ network, balancing connections between closely related and remote concepts. Notably, the chemistry semantic network showed substantially more reorganization, consistent with the chemistry contents of the SCIP intervention. The findings suggest that semantic memory reorganization may be a cognitive mechanism underlying successful creativity interventions in science education."

Koehler, Irene Sophia Plank, Christine Falter-Wagner","Interpersonal synchrony (IPS) is the mutual coordination of individuals’ behaviors during social interaction. Behavioral IPS has been studied increasingly in various contexts, such as a feature of the social interaction difficulties inherent to autism. To fully understand the dynamics of behavioral IPS, or reductions thereof in autism, the neural basis of IPS perception needs to be established, as it is an arguably essential ingredient to achieve IPS when engaging in social interactions. Thus, the current study’s aim was twofold: to establish the basic neuro-perceptual processing of IPS in typical observers and to test whether it might differ in autistic individuals. In a task-based fMRI paradigm, participants viewed short, silent video vignettes of humans during social interactions featuring a variation of behavioral IPS. The results show that IPS modulates the Action Observation Network. Interestingly, autistic participants showed the same IPS modulation of neural activation patterns as non-autistic participants, suggesting that IPS perception is spared and likely not underlying reduced behavioral IPS in autism. Nevertheless, a general difference of processing social interactions was found in autistic observers characterized by decreased neural activation in the right middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, and superior temporal areas. This may implicate frontoparietal regions as a source of attenuation for integrating top-down modulation during social interactions. As such, the attenuated production of behavioral IPS and subsequently social interaction difficulties in autism may not stem from differences in perceiving the timing of other’s behavior, but rather from altered integration thereof into the temporal coordination of behavior when interacting with others."

However, as we delve deeper into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it becomes imperative to move beyond mere comparison (e.g., how AI compares to humans across a range of tasks) to establish a visionary agenda for AI as collaborative partners in the pursuit of knowledge and scientific inquiry. This paper articulates an agenda that envisions AI models as the preeminent scientific collaborators. We advocate for the profound notion that our thinking should evolve to anticipate, and include, AI models as one of the most impactful tools in the social scientist's toolbox, offering assistance and collaboration with low-level tasks (e.g., analysis and interpretation of research findings) and high-level tasks (e.g., the discovery of new academic frontiers) alike. This transformation requires us to imagine AI's possible/probable roles in the research process. We discuss the prospect of AI as active knowledge generators within the scientific community — agents who participate in the scientific journey, aiming to make complex human issues more tractable and comprehensible. We foresee AI tools acting as co-researchers, contributing to research proposals and driving breakthrough discoveries. Ethical considerations are paramount, encompassing democratizing access to AI tools, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and privacy in AI-driven research, and addressing limitations and biases in large language models.

This study investigated the relationship between social camouflaging, life satisfaction, and depression symptoms in Polish women with ADHD. It aimed to fill a research gap in understanding ADHD manifestations in women, particularly focusing on social camouflaging—a concept known in autism, referring to strategies used to mask symptoms in social interactions. Methods: A total of 329 women with ADHD took part in an online survey. The survey measured ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-vI.I), life satisfaction with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Additionally, a novel set of questions, inspired by the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) but tailored for ADHD, was utilized to assess social camouflaging. Results: Results indicated a significant negative association between social camouflaging and life satisfaction and a positive correlation with depressive symptoms, even after controlling for demographic variables. Additionally, factors like being in a relationship and having a positive financial perception correlated with higher well-being. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures, the cross-sectional design, and participants' self-reported ADHD diagnosis are the main limitations of the study. Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of social camouflaging in understanding ADHD in women, suggesting that efforts to mask symptoms and meet societal expectations may link to lower life satisfaction and increased depressive symptoms. These findings advocate for continued research into these dynamics to develop more effective support for women with ADHD."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tgn9q,2024-02-27,Syntax Before Words—The Function-First Approach to the Evolution of Proto-Language,To be fetched,"One of the most captivating unsolved problems in cognitive science and evolutionary anthropology is the question of how humans evolved into linguistic beings. Conventionally, it has been assumed that the problem of the origin of language could be formulated as how the gap between animal communication and human language was bridged. I argue, however, that this assumption is misleading. The precursor to language does not lie in animal communication, but rather in a specific form of animal cognition observed in many species. The paper argues that the cognitive architecture informing linguistic syntax is grounded in action-based event perception. This shifts the central research question away from how to bridge the gap between animal signaling and linguistic communication towards understanding the difference between agent-based event cognition and propositional communication that utilizes this cognitive architecture. This perspective allows for the application of standard evolutionary theory in the form of the function-first approach, as the new perspective suggests that language initially evolved for communicating displaced agent-based events. In addition to this methodological proposal, the paper offers an evolutionary rationale for the initial transition towards primitive propositional communication, which eschews the use of arbitrary signs. In this scenario, syntax is represented by the inferred relations of present objects symbolizing thematic roles: the communicator represents the agent, a natural sign (e.g., a displayed hunted animal) symbolizes the patient, and the action is either implied by the status of the patient or additionally co-referentially expressed through a mimetic gesture. The evaluation of the proposal reveals that the evolutionary narrative produced by the function-first approach to language evolution inherently addresses key challenges such as trust and cooperation; since the function-first approach to language evolution posits that language emerged in a scenario closely related to the emergence of human cooperation. Furthermore, the findings suggest compatibility with numerous existing theories on human evolution, bridging the gap between hypotheses that emphasize social interaction—such as the Social Brain Hypothesis and sexual selection—and those emphasizing environmental shifts in East Africa—such as the Savanna Hypothesis, the Variability Selection or Pulse Climate Hypothesis and Dietary Shift or Hunting Hypothesis."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f4dz6,2024-02-27,Raising awareness isn’t enough: The role of the psychology of education in disability-related justice and inclusion in primary classrooms,To be fetched,"What: When it comes to education, disability inequality is arguably a structural and systemic issue. The social model of disability, enshrined in teacher education programmes in the UK espouses the ways in which school environments rather than disabled children themselves, need to adapt and change. However, the role of psychology in addressing disability-related systemic injustice is less clear. The aim of this paper is to consider the potential role of the psychology of education in working towards disability justice in schools.   Why? Many inclusive teacher-education programmes set out the ways in which environments may be created to include disabled children. Psychologists have focused on disabled children’s needs to access and participate in the classroom, but often do not consider their exclusion in social model terms, from curriculum materials, classroom displays, or material culture more generally. Favazza and colleagues (e.g. 2017) now offer a sizeable body of research showing that disability representation in school classrooms is negligible. This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."

This paper seeks to fill this gap by sharing insights gained from our own research project. We collected qualitative data through story stem completion tasks to explore perceptions and discourse surrounding disability among N = 195 children aged 5 – 11 years in the UK. We explain and critically assess our research decisions, including the creation of story stems, remote and indirect engagement with pupils and school staff, and our data collection methods.

Zuerst geben wir eine Übersicht über die Befragten, die demografische Verteilung und die jährlichen Statistiken, wie Diskriminierung und Coming Out. Danach heben wir wichtige Ergebnisse im Zusammenhang mit Konversionstherapien hervor. Anschliessend stellen wir Statistiken über gemeldete Hassverbrechen vor, einschliesslich der Meldungen an die Polizei und den Erfahrungen der Opfer. Im Anschluss präsentieren wir Schlüsselstatistiken über die Änderungen von Namen und Geschlechtseintrag in verschiedenen Bereichen. Letztlich präsentieren wir Ergebnisse zur Gesundheit und dem Wohlbefinden von LGBTIQ+ Personen. Wie in den vorangegangenen Umfragen haben wir verschiedene Versionen des Online-Fragebogens entwickelt, die auf Angehörige sexueller Minderheiten (z. B. asexuelle, schwule, lesbische, bi- oder pansexuelle Menschen) und Angehörige geschlechtlicher Minderheiten (z. B. trans oder intergeschlechtliche Menschen) zugeschnitten sind. Dies erlaubt uns die spezifischen Herausforderungen (z. B. rechtliche Situation, Diskriminierung), mit denen verschiedene Untergruppen der LGBTIQ+ Community konfrontiert sind, zu verstehen. Interessierte cis-heterosexuelle Personen konnten ebenfalls an der Umfrage teilnehmen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Personen sowohl einer sexuellen als auch einer geschlechtlichen Minderheit angehören können. Um den Zeitaufwand für die Beantwortung der Umfrage zu verringern, füllten die Teilnehmenden nur eine Version des Fragebogens aus. Alle Versionen wurden ins Englische, Deutsche, Französische und Italienische übersetzt. Dank der Unterstützung vieler LGBTIQ+ Organisationen, Zeitschriften und Personen, die unsere Studie über verschiedene Medienkanäle verbreiteten, beantworteten 2812 Personen unseren Fragebogen von Januar 2023 bis September 2023. Im vorliegenden Bericht konzentrieren wir uns auf die wichtigsten Ergebnisse für sexuelle Minderheiten, geschlechtliche Minderheiten und cis-heterosexuelle Personen."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5tz6u,2024-02-27,Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel - 2023 Summary Report,To be fetched,"In 2023, many discussions have brought issues related to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and queer/questioning (LGBTIQ+) individuals to the forefront. These discussions encompass a range of topics, including the ban on conversion therapies at different levels and the increasing visibility of trans and non-binary individuals in the media. Questions around these issues were part of the 2023 annual survey of the Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel. In the fifth wave of the Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel, we present five central themes from our annual survey. First, we provide insights into the survey participant’s characteristics, demographic distribution, and annual report information, such as discrimination and coming out. Second, we highlight key findings related to conversion therapies. Third, we share reported hate crime statistics, including reporting to the police and the victims’ experiences. Fourth, we present key statistics regarding name and gender marker changes in various areas. Finally, we provide information about LGBTIQ+ individuals’ health and well-being. To account for the specific challenges (e.g., legal situation, discrimination) that different subgroups of the LGBTIQ+ community face, we designed – as in the previous waves – different versions of a web questionnaire that were tailored to sexual minorities (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual people) and gender minorities (e.g., trans or intersex people). Interested cis-heterosexual people were also invited to participate in the survey. Please note that people can be both sexual and gender minority members. To reduce the time spent answering the survey, participants only completed one version of the questionnaire. All versions were translated into English, German, French, and Italian. Thanks to the support of many LGBTIQ+ organizations, magazines, and people who shared our study widely through different media channels, 2’812 people replied to our questionnaire from January 2023 to September 2023. In the present report, we focus on the key findings for sexual minorities, gender minorities, and cis-heterosexual people."

However, there has been limited systematic exploration of the disability represented in hate crime scenarios, and of responses of disabled people1. We surveyed N= 467 adults online, presenting them with disability-based hate crime scenarios. We orthogonally changed the disability of the hate crime target (deaf person or wheelchair user) across Hungary, Italy, Nordic countries, and the UK. We measured responses and intentions, direct contact with disabled people, identification as disabled, and reasons for their responses. Results showed cross-national differences, and increased helping intentions among disabled participants. Path analyses showed that anger and anxiety significantly mediated the association between direct contact with disabled people and helping intentions. Qualitative template analysis showed that helping and avoidance intentions from disabled and non-disabled people are motivated by a variety of reasons."

Furthermore, there is a scarcity of academic literature discussing best practice in terms of research conducted (a) with children instead of adults, (b) within school settings, or (c) addressing ableism and disability-based prejudice. This paper seeks to fill this gap by sharing insights gained from our own research project. We collected qualitative data through story stem completion tasks to explore perceptions and discourse surrounding disability among N = 195 children aged 5 – 11 years in the UK. We explain and critically assess our research decisions, including the creation of story stems, remote and indirect engagement with pupils and school staff, and our data collection methods. In doing so, we highlight the array of choices available to researchers, emphasize the importance of further dialogue within the research community, and advocate for evidence-based best practices in this specific research area."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tgn9q,2024-02-27,Syntax Before Words—The Function-First Approach to the Evolution of Proto-Language,Till Nikolaus von Heiseler,"One of the most captivating unsolved problems in cognitive science and evolutionary anthropology is the question of how humans evolved into linguistic beings. Conventionally, it has been assumed that the problem of the origin of language could be formulated as how the gap between animal communication and human language was bridged. I argue, however, that this assumption is misleading. The precursor to language does not lie in animal communication, but rather in a specific form of animal cognition observed in many species. The paper argues that the cognitive architecture informing linguistic syntax is grounded in action-based event perception. This shifts the central research question away from how to bridge the gap between animal signaling and linguistic communication towards understanding the difference between agent-based event cognition and propositional communication that utilizes this cognitive architecture. This perspective allows for the application of standard evolutionary theory in the form of the function-first approach, as the new perspective suggests that language initially evolved for communicating displaced agent-based events. In addition to this methodological proposal, the paper offers an evolutionary rationale for the initial transition towards primitive propositional communication, which eschews the use of arbitrary signs. In this scenario, syntax is represented by the inferred relations of present objects symbolizing thematic roles: the communicator represents the agent, a natural sign (e.g., a displayed hunted animal) symbolizes the patient, and the action is either implied by the status of the patient or additionally co-referentially expressed through a mimetic gesture. The evaluation of the proposal reveals that the evolutionary narrative produced by the function-first approach to language evolution inherently addresses key challenges such as trust and cooperation; since the function-first approach to language evolution posits that language emerged in a scenario closely related to the emergence of human cooperation. Furthermore, the findings suggest compatibility with numerous existing theories on human evolution, bridging the gap between hypotheses that emphasize social interaction—such as the Social Brain Hypothesis and sexual selection—and those emphasizing environmental shifts in East Africa—such as the Savanna Hypothesis, the Variability Selection or Pulse Climate Hypothesis and Dietary Shift or Hunting Hypothesis."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f4dz6,2024-02-27,Raising awareness isn’t enough: The role of the psychology of education in disability-related justice and inclusion in primary classrooms,Sian E Jones,"What: When it comes to education, disability inequality is arguably a structural and systemic issue. The social model of disability, enshrined in teacher education programmes in the UK espouses the ways in which school environments rather than disabled children themselves, need to adapt and change. However, the role of psychology in addressing disability-related systemic injustice is less clear. The aim of this paper is to consider the potential role of the psychology of education in working towards disability justice in schools.   Why? Many inclusive teacher-education programmes set out the ways in which environments may be created to include disabled children. Psychologists have focused on disabled children’s needs to access and participate in the classroom, but often do not consider their exclusion in social model terms, from curriculum materials, classroom displays, or material culture more generally. Favazza and colleagues (e.g. 2017) now offer a sizeable body of research showing that disability representation in school classrooms is negligible. This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."

This study investigated the relationship between social camouflaging, life satisfaction, and depression symptoms in Polish women with ADHD. It aimed to fill a research gap in understanding ADHD manifestations in women, particularly focusing on social camouflaging—a concept known in autism, referring to strategies used to mask symptoms in social interactions. Methods: A total of 329 women with ADHD took part in an online survey. The survey measured ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-vI.I), life satisfaction with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Additionally, a novel set of questions, inspired by the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) but tailored for ADHD, was utilized to assess social camouflaging. Results: Results indicated a significant negative association between social camouflaging and life satisfaction and a positive correlation with depressive symptoms, even after controlling for demographic variables. Additionally, factors like being in a relationship and having a positive financial perception correlated with higher well-being. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures, the cross-sectional design, and participants' self-reported ADHD diagnosis are the main limitations of the study. Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of social camouflaging in understanding ADHD in women, suggesting that efforts to mask symptoms and meet societal expectations may link to lower life satisfaction and increased depressive symptoms. These findings advocate for continued research into these dynamics to develop more effective support for women with ADHD."

Boyd, Kate Blackburn","The social sciences have long relied on comparative work as the foundation upon which we understand the complexities of human behavior and society. However, as we delve deeper into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it becomes imperative to move beyond mere comparison (e.g., how AI compares to humans across a range of tasks) to establish a visionary agenda for AI as collaborative partners in the pursuit of knowledge and scientific inquiry. This paper articulates an agenda that envisions AI models as the preeminent scientific collaborators. We advocate for the profound notion that our thinking should evolve to anticipate, and include, AI models as one of the most impactful tools in the social scientist's toolbox, offering assistance and collaboration with low-level tasks (e.g., analysis and interpretation of research findings) and high-level tasks (e.g., the discovery of new academic frontiers) alike. This transformation requires us to imagine AI's possible/probable roles in the research process. We discuss the prospect of AI as active knowledge generators within the scientific community — agents who participate in the scientific journey, aiming to make complex human issues more tractable and comprehensible. We foresee AI tools acting as co-researchers, contributing to research proposals and driving breakthrough discoveries. Ethical considerations are paramount, encompassing democratizing access to AI tools, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and privacy in AI-driven research, and addressing limitations and biases in large language models. Embracing AI as collaborative partners will revolutionize the landscape of social sciences, enabling innovative, inclusive, and ethically sound research practices."

Bush, Daniel E. Gustavson, Manuel Anglada-Tort, Hope Sparks Lancaster, Miriam A. Mosing","Impaired musical rhythm abilities and developmental speech-language related disorders are biologically and clinically intertwined. Prior work examining their relationship has primarily used small samples; here, we studied associations at population-scale by conducting the largest systematic epidemiological investigation to date (total N = 39,092). Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we predicted that rhythm impairment would be a significant risk factor for speech-language disorders in the general adult population. Findings were consistent across multiple independent datasets and rhythm subskills (including beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination), and aggregate meta-analyzed data showed that rhythm impairment is a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders (OR = 1.32 [1.14 – 1.49]; p &lt; .0001). Further, cross-trait polygenic score analyses indicate shared genetic architecture between musical rhythm and reading abilities, providing evidence for genetic pleiotropy between rhythm and language-related phenotypes."

In contrast, a neurodiversity-affirmative assessment involves centring autistic perspectives, focusing on strengths, differences and needs, and acknowledging the role of the environment. The present study was designed to focus on professionals’ perspectives on neurodiversity-affirmative autism diagnostic assessment. Autism community stakeholders were consulted on the design of the interview schedule. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 professionals aged 30-73 years who work in a multidisciplinary team within the UK. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Professionals described a holistic, balanced assessment involving assessing individual and contextual strengths and needs. Our findings suggest that assessing strengths could be beneficial for autistic children and young people’s long-term wellbeing. Professionals also highlighted an autistic person-centred assessment and a strengths-and-needs-led, rather than diagnosis-led approach. These findings highlight the importance of a holistic, person-centred, strengths-and-needs-led assessment that has the potential to support autistic thriving."

Consistent with theory and prior research, immigrants reported lower life satisfaction than natives on average, while the size of the life satisfaction gap varied substantially across individuals and countries. Low neuroticism and high extraversion reduced the life satisfaction gap, suggesting that these personality traits may serve as internal resources for immigrants when faced with migration-related stressors. In contrast, we found a wider life satisfaction gap between immigrants and natives in high-income countries, suggesting that economic disparities between immigrants and natives in prosperous nations may contribute to the observed life satisfaction gap."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ctjp6,2024-02-27,The Forgotten Body: The Emergence of Conscious Experiences in Early Life,To be fetched,"Bayne’s and colleagues’ review constitutes a valuable contribution to the nascent field of developmental consciousness studies. Yet, it overlooks a significant body of previous work already calling for endorsing a developmental perspective in understanding conscious experiences from an embodied and interactive perspective (Delafield-Butt &amp; Gangopadhyay; Ciaunica &amp; Crucianelli 2019; Quintero &amp; De Jaegher 2020; Ciaunica et al. 2021a).  The review revolves around the following puzzle: “ (…) none of the neural machinery required for consciousness is in place immediately after conception (e.g. neurogenesis does not even begin until weeks later). At one developmental timepoint, the human organism lacks the capacity for consciousness; at another timepoint, it has acquired that capacity. When this change takes place?” (Bayne et al. 2023: 1135).   Arguably, the search for the neural correlates of consciousness in adults has been indeed rather influential in the past decades (Seth &amp; Bayne 2022). Yet, tackling the fascinating question of the emergence of early experiences through a similar individualistic, adult-biased and neuro-centric lens may be misleading. A systematic critical argumentation of why this is the case cannot be pursued here, due to space limitations, and was proposed already elsewhere (Ciaunica et al. 2021b).   Here I will focus on one key overlooked aspect, namely the ‘forgotten’ fundamental co-embodied nature of human experiences in early life, which was entirely set aside by the Authors in their review."

I invented it after learning from personal experiences and the professional media as well as social media that many people who committed suicide had tried thoughtless awareness meditation techniques like Vipassana and some even popular mantra chanting technique like Hare Krishna mantra which did not prove enough in giving them the required peace they needed. This led me to research for a technique which should be as powerful as I can logically make it and that resulted into the invention of Counter Positive Technique in Feb 2024. After its invention, I shared it with many people who all told me that it is giving them perfect results in removing negative thoughts and negative emotions. Hence, I am publishing this technique to the wider psychology research community for them to do RCTs on it and for popular dissemination!"
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8gwpr,2024-02-27,Burbidge_Feb2024_IBMSchoolTransition,To be fetched,"Identity-based motivation theory predicts that how well students do in school and how certain they are of attaining their school-focused possible identities recursively interact with what they infer when school tasks and goals feel hard to think about or do. Recursivity implies bidirectionality, but studies to date focus on unidirectional paths. To address this gap, we devised a three-time-point, two-month study during a secondary school transition (Chinese students N=818, Mage=12, 44% female). We obtained prior grades (T0) and placement test scores (T1+) and asked whether secondary school placement fit student preference (T2+). Students filled out questionnaires at critical junctures: a month before the placement test (T1), the day test results were announced (T2), and after learning their school placement (T3). Structural equation model results show both recursive and unidirectional paths. The recursive paths are between school-focused possible identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-importance (inferring value when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do) and school achievement; the unidirectional path is between identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-impossibility (inferring self-irrelevance when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do). T1 school-focused possible identity certainty boosted T1+ placement test scores and T2 difficulty-as-importance (controlling for T0 grades, T1 difficulty-as-importance respectively); T1 difficulty-as-importance boosted T2 school-focused possible identity certainty (controlling for T1 school-focused possible identity certainty). T1+ test scores boosted T2 difficulty-as-importance; T2 difficulty-as-importance boosted T3 school-focused possible identity certainty. Lower T1 school-focused possible identity certainty carries over to higher T2 difficulty-as-impossibility (controlling for T1 difficulty-as-impossibility) and this process recurs from T2 to T3."

A Longitudinal Study of Czech Adolescents to Differentiate Within- and Between-Person Effects,To be fetched,"The associations between violent video games (VVG) and both aggression and empathy have been examined in numerous studies. VVG are often depicted as triggers for increased aggression and decreased empathy in line with the General Aggression Model. However, longitudinal evidence that implements more than three waves, distinguishes within- and between-person effects, incorporates an independent assessment of violence, and focuses on various dimensions of aggression and empathy remains scarce. Drawing on a representative sample of 3,010 Czech adolescents (aged 13-17), data were collected over four waves (at six-month intervals) to measure physical and verbal aggression, and cognitive and affective empathy. VVG was evaluated based on participants' open-ended responses. To differentiate within- and between-person associations, a (multi-group) random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was employed. At the between-person level, VVG positively correlated with cognitive empathy, verbal aggression, and physical aggression. At the within-person level, two hypotheses were examined: the selection effect, which investigated the effects of changes in aggression/empathy on changes in VVG; and the desensitization effect, which explored the effects of changes in VVG on alterations in aggression/empathy. All desensitization effects were statistically insignificant. Regarding selection effects, an increase in affective empathy was linked to a decrease in VVG. Conversely, an increase in physical aggression was associated with an increase in VVG, both positively and negatively, depending on the wave of data collection. Furthermore, the moderation effects of age and gender were tested at both levels. The findings challenge the portrayal of VVG as a significant contributor to heightened aggression and decreased empathy in adolescents."

Outcomes of a recent randomized clinical trial indicate that parent-implemented communication interventions (PICTs) facilitate communication outcomes for DHH children. In the current study, we implemented a serial mediation analysis to isolate the active ingredients of a PICT for DHH children.   Methods: This single-site parallel stratified clinical trial (2x2; hearing device, communication mode) enrolled 96 parent-child dyads. Child inclusion criteria were: (a) between 12-18 months, (b) diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss, (c) no additional diagnoses, (d) had one parent with normal hearing, and (e) exposed to some degree of spoken language by their parents. Dyads were randomized to the control group or the PICT group, which taught parents to use communication support strategies (i.e., engagement strategies, primary language strategies, and supplemental language strategies) weekly via telehealth for 6 months. Parents’ strategy use was measured before, during, and immediately after intervention. Child communication outcomes were measured before and immediately after intervention.   Results: Results demonstrated a significant serial mediation of the effect of PICT on child communication outcomes through parents’ use of engagement strategies and primary language strategies.  Conclusion: Parents in the PICT condition learned  to use engagement strategies, which in turn, facilitated their implementation of primary language strategies, ultimately leading to an improvement in child communication outcomes. Understanding the active ingredients and causal pathway of the PICT is an important consideration for implementation of the PICT in clinical practice."

Parent-implemented communication interventions (PICTs) are a promising form of early interventions for DHH toddlers. The current study evaluates (1) the effect of PICT on parent strategy use and child communication and (2) the extent to which communication mode moderates these effects.  Methods: This single-site parallel stratified clinical trial (2x2; hearing device, communication mode) enrolled 96 parent-child dyads. Child inclusion criteria were: (a) between 12-18 months, (b) diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss, (c) no additional diagnoses, (d) had one parent with normal hearing, and (e) exposed to some degree of spoken language by their parents. Communication mode was measured as spoken language or sign language, which primarily included sign-supported speech. Dyads were randomized to the PICT or control group. PICT occurred weekly via telehealth over 6 months. Outcomes were measured before, during, and immediately after intervention.  Results: Parent strategy use (d = 1.614) and child communication (d = 0.635) were greater for participants in the PICT group. The intervention effect on child communication was significantly greater for children exposed to sign language than children exposed to spoken language (B = 18.929, SE = 8.094, p = 0.019). Conclusion: PICT effectively facilitates parent strategy use and child communication. Sign language, more specifically sign-supported speech, may increase the benefits of PICT and, as such, future research should explore the systematic inclusion of sign-supported speech within the context of early interventions for DHH toddlers."

Prior studies have suggested that such demands may impact motor performance, including selection of the most efficient arm to use to reach to a target in a given location. The research conducted here expands upon prior studies by 1) examining the role of cognitive load in arm choice efficiency using a novel virtual reality paradigm designed to mimic the demands of real-life visual search, object selection, and reaching to targets, and 2) examining the impact of such demands on motor performance in individuals with stroke. To manipulate cognitive demand, we varied the semantic similarity of objects in the reaching space and the presence or absence of a secondary task. We hypothesized that cognitive load would modulate efficiency of arm choice and performance in both neurotypicals and individuals with stroke. The results showed reduced efficiency of arm choice for the stroke and neurotypical control groups under increased demand.  Under cognitive load, participants with stroke also showed slower reach initiation, slower movements, increased reach curvature, and increased performance differences between the paretic and non-paretic arms. These data indicate that cognitive factors influence arm choice efficiency in naturalistic reaching tasks in neurotypical individuals, and both arm choice efficiency and motor performance in stroke. Efficiency and performance decrements under cognitive load may in turn influence reduced use of the paretic arm during daily activities."

A Longitudinal Study of Czech Adolescents to Differentiate Within- and Between-Person Effects,"David Lacko, Hana Machackova, David Smahel","The associations between violent video games (VVG) and both aggression and empathy have been examined in numerous studies. VVG are often depicted as triggers for increased aggression and decreased empathy in line with the General Aggression Model. However, longitudinal evidence that implements more than three waves, distinguishes within- and between-person effects, incorporates an independent assessment of violence, and focuses on various dimensions of aggression and empathy remains scarce. Drawing on a representative sample of 3,010 Czech adolescents (aged 13-17), data were collected over four waves (at six-month intervals) to measure physical and verbal aggression, and cognitive and affective empathy. VVG was evaluated based on participants' open-ended responses. To differentiate within- and between-person associations, a (multi-group) random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was employed. At the between-person level, VVG positively correlated with cognitive empathy, verbal aggression, and physical aggression. At the within-person level, two hypotheses were examined: the selection effect, which investigated the effects of changes in aggression/empathy on changes in VVG; and the desensitization effect, which explored the effects of changes in VVG on alterations in aggression/empathy. All desensitization effects were statistically insignificant. Regarding selection effects, an increase in affective empathy was linked to a decrease in VVG. Conversely, an increase in physical aggression was associated with an increase in VVG, both positively and negatively, depending on the wave of data collection. Furthermore, the moderation effects of age and gender were tested at both levels. The findings challenge the portrayal of VVG as a significant contributor to heightened aggression and decreased empathy in adolescents."

Recursivity implies bidirectionality, but studies to date focus on unidirectional paths. To address this gap, we devised a three-time-point, two-month study during a secondary school transition (Chinese students N=818, Mage=12, 44% female). We obtained prior grades (T0) and placement test scores (T1+) and asked whether secondary school placement fit student preference (T2+). Students filled out questionnaires at critical junctures: a month before the placement test (T1), the day test results were announced (T2), and after learning their school placement (T3). Structural equation model results show both recursive and unidirectional paths. The recursive paths are between school-focused possible identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-importance (inferring value when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do) and school achievement; the unidirectional path is between identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-impossibility (inferring self-irrelevance when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do). T1 school-focused possible identity certainty boosted T1+ placement test scores and T2 difficulty-as-importance (controlling for T0 grades, T1 difficulty-as-importance respectively); T1 difficulty-as-importance boosted T2 school-focused possible identity certainty (controlling for T1 school-focused possible identity certainty). T1+ test scores boosted T2 difficulty-as-importance; T2 difficulty-as-importance boosted T3 school-focused possible identity certainty. Lower T1 school-focused possible identity certainty carries over to higher T2 difficulty-as-impossibility (controlling for T1 difficulty-as-impossibility) and this process recurs from T2 to T3."

Yet, it overlooks a significant body of previous work already calling for endorsing a developmental perspective in understanding conscious experiences from an embodied and interactive perspective (Delafield-Butt &amp; Gangopadhyay; Ciaunica &amp; Crucianelli 2019; Quintero &amp; De Jaegher 2020; Ciaunica et al. 2021a).  The review revolves around the following puzzle: “ (…) none of the neural machinery required for consciousness is in place immediately after conception (e.g. neurogenesis does not even begin until weeks later). At one developmental timepoint, the human organism lacks the capacity for consciousness; at another timepoint, it has acquired that capacity. When this change takes place?” (Bayne et al. 2023: 1135).   Arguably, the search for the neural correlates of consciousness in adults has been indeed rather influential in the past decades (Seth &amp; Bayne 2022). Yet, tackling the fascinating question of the emergence of early experiences through a similar individualistic, adult-biased and neuro-centric lens may be misleading. A systematic critical argumentation of why this is the case cannot be pursued here, due to space limitations, and was proposed already elsewhere (Ciaunica et al. 2021b).   Here I will focus on one key overlooked aspect, namely the ‘forgotten’ fundamental co-embodied nature of human experiences in early life, which was entirely set aside by the Authors in their review."

Consistent with theory and prior research, immigrants reported lower life satisfaction than natives on average, while the size of the life satisfaction gap varied substantially across individuals and countries. Low neuroticism and high extraversion reduced the life satisfaction gap, suggesting that these personality traits may serve as internal resources for immigrants when faced with migration-related stressors. In contrast, we found a wider life satisfaction gap between immigrants and natives in high-income countries, suggesting that economic disparities between immigrants and natives in prosperous nations may contribute to the observed life satisfaction gap."

In contrast, a neurodiversity-affirmative assessment involves centring autistic perspectives, focusing on strengths, differences and needs, and acknowledging the role of the environment. The present study was designed to focus on professionals’ perspectives on neurodiversity-affirmative autism diagnostic assessment. Autism community stakeholders were consulted on the design of the interview schedule. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 professionals aged 30-73 years who work in a multidisciplinary team within the UK. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Professionals described a holistic, balanced assessment involving assessing individual and contextual strengths and needs. Our findings suggest that assessing strengths could be beneficial for autistic children and young people’s long-term wellbeing. Professionals also highlighted an autistic person-centred assessment and a strengths-and-needs-led, rather than diagnosis-led approach. These findings highlight the importance of a holistic, person-centred, strengths-and-needs-led assessment that has the potential to support autistic thriving."

However, the mechanisms of social cognitive dysfunction in SZ remain poorly understood, which impedes the design of novel interventions to improve outcomes. This pre-registered project (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JH5FC) examines the representation of social functioning in the brain’s functional architecture across early psychosis (EP) and SZ. The study contains two parts: a confirmatory and an exploratory portion. In the confirmatory portion, we identified specific resting-state brain connectivity disruptions evident in EP and SZ. We performed a seed-based connectivity analysis using brain regions associated with social cognitive dysfunction in SZ (based on a published review) to test whether aberrant functional connectivity observed in SZ was also present in EP. In the exploratory portion, we assessed the out-of-sample generalizability and precision of resting state connectivity-based predictive models of social cognition. We used machine learning to predict social cognition from whole-brain connectomes and established the generalizability of these brain-behavior relationships with out-of-sample testing and cross-validation (to handle confounding variables). Results reveal significant decreases between the left inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus that were evident in SZ but not EP. This connectivity profile is significantly associated with social cognition/functioning in both SZ and EP. Null predictive modeling results reveal the importance of out-of-sample evaluation, proper null hypothesis testing, and confound removal procedures. Overall, this work provides insights into the brain's functional architecture in SZ and EP. This work suggests that IFG-IPS connectivity profiles could be an important prognostic biomarker of social impairments and may be a target for future interventions focused on improved treatment outcomes related to social functioning."

Yet, a consensual framework that defines the evolutionary function of anxiety and distinguishes between its (mal)adaptive forms is lacking. The present work addresses this gap through the elaboration of a theoretical approach that integrates behavioral, biological, and cognitive processes across three threat-related emotions -—anxiety, anger, and fear— using Signal Detection Theory. We review a broad selection of relevant theory and research to reach a mathematical formalization allowing to mechanistically interpret outcomes related to these three emotions. We also propose methods for diagnosing the adaptive fit of the defensive emotion displayed in a given situation and characterizing the corresponding behavioral response. With the ability to account for a wide range of phenomena, this approach bears significant implications for theory and practice related to anxiety, anger, and fear."

Few empirical studies, however, have examined adolescents’ daily negative and positive experiences on SM and its proximal impacts on suicidal ideation (SI), particularly using intensive monitoring designs.  Method: Adolescents (N= 60; 14-17 years; 49% girls; 62% LGBTQ+) recruited using SM across the United States and participated in an 8-week intensive monitoring protocol. Ecological momentary assessment (3 brief surveys per day) asked about negative and positive SM experiences and SI (passive and active). Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the within-person relationships between daily SM experiences (e.g., individual fluctuations compared to a person’s average) and SI, controlling for average levels of SM experiences, SM use screen time, and lifetime SI.  Results: Significant within-person effects of negative and positive SM experiences were associated with days when adolescents had SI. Specifically, on days when teens endorsed more frequent negative SM experiences than usual, they were more likely to report SI. However, more positive SM experiences than usual were associated with a lower likelihood of having SI. There were no significant effects of SM use (“screen time”) on SI or on the reverse associations of SI on next-day SM experiences.   Conclusions: Results indicate that SM experiences may be dynamic and modifiable risk and protective factors for SI in adolescents, whereas there is no effect of SM screen time on SI. Our results highlight that targeting negative SM experiences and augmenting the positive experiences on SM may be critical targets to improve teens’ mental health and prevent suicide, rather than focusing on limiting SM screen time."

The focus of this article is on the maturity principle of personality development. We discuss problems that may arise when relying on constructs developed in a specific group (i.e., primarily upper-middle class individuals in the United States), and then using value-laden labels such as “mature” and “healthy” to suggest that one personality profile is better than another. We aim to motivate researchers to not only reflect on using labels suggesting that certain profiles or changes in personality are universally desirable or undesirable, especially without attention to diversity in methods and samples, but also to understand how our values inform how we conduct and communicate our science."

While research has extensively studied multisensory integration (MSI) using idealised, well-controlled stimuli, there is a need to understand this process in response to complex, naturalistic stimuli encountered in everyday life. This study investigated behavioural and neuronal MSI in neurotypical adults experiencing audio-visual speech within a naturalistic, social context. Our novel paradigm incorporated a broader social situational context, complete words, and speech-supporting iconic gestures, allowing for context-based pragmatics and semantic priors. We investigated MSI in the presence of unimodal (auditory or visual) or complementary, bimodal speech signals. During audio-visual speech trials, compared to unimodal trials, participants more accurately recognised spoken words and showed a more pronounced suppression of alpha power—an indicator of heightened integration load. Importantly, on the neuronal level, these effects surpassed mere summation of unimodal responses, suggesting non-linear MSI mechanisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that typically developing adults integrate audio-visual speech and gesture information to facilitate speech comprehension in noisy environments, highlighting the importance of studying MSI in ecologically valid contexts."

We assessed perception of present levels of inequality, and estimates of past and future inequality. Study 1 (N=354) was run in 2016 and estimates referred to 10 years before/after 2016. Study 2 (N=246) was run in 2021 and estimates referred to 5 years before/after 2021. In Study 1, a strong underestimation of present inequality emerged. Estimated future inequality was higher than estimation of present inequality, which in turn was significantly higher than perceived past inequality. Study 2 replicated these results partially, as past estimates of inequality which did not differ from present estimates. When comparing expectations for 2016 and 2026 across the two studies, no differences emerged - indicating that participants estimated on average similar scores for corresponding time stamps. Political orientation did not affect these results. This research confirms past literature on inequality underestimation, and shows that individuals are consistently pessimistic towards the future. This shared pessimism may lead left- and right-oriented individuals alike towards a generalized skepticism about redistributive efforts, and should therefore be addressed in future research."

The developmental transition to young adulthood involves social, psychological and physical change, which can be challenging. Adolescents living with chronic skin conditions may experience greater challenges than their healthy peers due to the potential addition of managing and coping with their condition. Using semi-structured interviews and an interpretative phenomenological approach, this study explored experiences of transition from adolescence to adulthood in the context of chronic skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa). Seven themes emerged: (1) The Medical Journey; (2) Practical Difficulties; (3) Physical Impacts; (4) Psychological Impacts; (5) Self-Conscious Emotions; (6) Stigma; and (7) Building Resilience. Our findings add to our understanding of the difficulties experienced by young people with chronic skin conditions, particularly during adolescence. Our findings also offer insight into how researchers and practitioners can support these young people throughout their developmental journey from adolescence into young adulthood."

In applied branding contexts, such dimensions are employed to find music that conveys core brand values. A practically small number of dimensions for consumers to rate music assets on are desirable and often derived based on factor analytic methods. However, often resulting factor analytic structures must be subjectively reinterpreted and analyses begin by discovering an a priori unknown number of latent variables in a dataset, or, if a desirable number of dimensions is requested, produces solutions with highly unequal component importances. Alternatively, we propose a machine learning approach to discovering useful dimensions in high-dimensional data: Diversity-Induced Self-Representation Feature Selection (D-ISR; Liu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, and Wang, 2017), a data-driven methodology which can transition between simple and complex representations of the same (emotional-semantic) space. With a large dataset (NParticipants = 55,593; NResponses = 5,820,188; NAudioTracks = 251), we use D-ISR to select 14 core attributes from a pool of 212. The subset can reconstruct the original multi- dimensional space of all 212 attributes with good reconstruction accuracy (Mean RMSE = 0.32 [0, 10]). Consequently, whilst good reconstruction accuracy cannot always be guaranteed, we demonstrate a principled approach for discovering any a priori number of features to represent a large dimensional space. Framed this way, the decision about whether to use N vs. N+1 features only marginally affects reconstruction error and hence has broad practical utility. The method can be generalised to similar domains (e.g., personality measurement)."

Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be self-structured by the people involved themselves. The latter hence vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. In the scientific study of executive functions, these different situations hence exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. To address the challenges of these type of situations, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses from the behaviour of the participants; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research which usually focus on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions."

Here, we asked whether people differentially focus their attention on semantic or perceptual information over development during memory retrieval. First, we trained a multivoxel classifier to characterize whole-brain neural patterns reflecting semantic versus perceptual attention in a cued attention task. We then used this classifier to quantify how attention varied in a separate dataset in which children, adolescents, and adults retrieved autobiographical, semantic, and episodic memories. All age groups demonstrated a semantic attentional bias during memory retrieval, with significant age differences in this bias during the semantic task. Trials began with a preparatory picture cue followed by a retrieval question, which allowed us to ask whether attentional biases varied by trial period. Adults showed a semantic bias earlier during the picture cues, whereas adolescents showed this bias during the question. Adults and adolescents also engaged different brain regions—superior parietal cortex and ventral visual regions, respectively—during preparatory picture cues. Our results demonstrate that retrieval-related attention undergoes refinement beyond childhood. These findings suggest that alongside expanding semantic knowledge, attention-related changes may support the maturation of factual knowledge retrieval."

The focus of this article is on the maturity principle of personality development. We discuss problems that may arise when relying on constructs developed in a specific group (i.e., primarily upper-middle class individuals in the United States), and then using value-laden labels such as “mature” and “healthy” to suggest that one personality profile is better than another. We aim to motivate researchers to not only reflect on using labels suggesting that certain profiles or changes in personality are universally desirable or undesirable, especially without attention to diversity in methods and samples, but also to understand how our values inform how we conduct and communicate our science."

In applied branding contexts, such dimensions are employed to find music that conveys core brand values. A practically small number of dimensions for consumers to rate music assets on are desirable and often derived based on factor analytic methods. However, often resulting factor analytic structures must be subjectively reinterpreted and analyses begin by discovering an a priori unknown number of latent variables in a dataset, or, if a desirable number of dimensions is requested, produces solutions with highly unequal component importances. Alternatively, we propose a machine learning approach to discovering useful dimensions in high-dimensional data: Diversity-Induced Self-Representation Feature Selection (D-ISR; Liu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, and Wang, 2017), a data-driven methodology which can transition between simple and complex representations of the same (emotional-semantic) space. With a large dataset (NParticipants = 55,593; NResponses = 5,820,188; NAudioTracks = 251), we use D-ISR to select 14 core attributes from a pool of 212. The subset can reconstruct the original multi- dimensional space of all 212 attributes with good reconstruction accuracy (Mean RMSE = 0.32 [0, 10]). Consequently, whilst good reconstruction accuracy cannot always be guaranteed, we demonstrate a principled approach for discovering any a priori number of features to represent a large dimensional space. Framed this way, the decision about whether to use N vs. N+1 features only marginally affects reconstruction error and hence has broad practical utility. The method can be generalised to similar domains (e.g., personality measurement)."

This research focused on inequality perception across time. We predicted that people would underestimate present inequality levels, while being optimistic about past inequality, and pessimistic about future inequality. We assessed perception of present levels of inequality, and estimates of past and future inequality. Study 1 (N=354) was run in 2016 and estimates referred to 10 years before/after 2016. Study 2 (N=246) was run in 2021 and estimates referred to 5 years before/after 2021. In Study 1, a strong underestimation of present inequality emerged. Estimated future inequality was higher than estimation of present inequality, which in turn was significantly higher than perceived past inequality. Study 2 replicated these results partially, as past estimates of inequality which did not differ from present estimates. When comparing expectations for 2016 and 2026 across the two studies, no differences emerged - indicating that participants estimated on average similar scores for corresponding time stamps. Political orientation did not affect these results. This research confirms past literature on inequality underestimation, and shows that individuals are consistently pessimistic towards the future. This shared pessimism may lead left- and right-oriented individuals alike towards a generalized skepticism about redistributive efforts, and should therefore be addressed in future research."

Here, we asked whether people differentially focus their attention on semantic or perceptual information over development during memory retrieval. First, we trained a multivoxel classifier to characterize whole-brain neural patterns reflecting semantic versus perceptual attention in a cued attention task. We then used this classifier to quantify how attention varied in a separate dataset in which children, adolescents, and adults retrieved autobiographical, semantic, and episodic memories. All age groups demonstrated a semantic attentional bias during memory retrieval, with significant age differences in this bias during the semantic task. Trials began with a preparatory picture cue followed by a retrieval question, which allowed us to ask whether attentional biases varied by trial period. Adults showed a semantic bias earlier during the picture cues, whereas adolescents showed this bias during the question. Adults and adolescents also engaged different brain regions—superior parietal cortex and ventral visual regions, respectively—during preparatory picture cues. Our results demonstrate that retrieval-related attention undergoes refinement beyond childhood. These findings suggest that alongside expanding semantic knowledge, attention-related changes may support the maturation of factual knowledge retrieval."

The developmental transition to young adulthood involves social, psychological and physical change, which can be challenging. Adolescents living with chronic skin conditions may experience greater challenges than their healthy peers due to the potential addition of managing and coping with their condition. Using semi-structured interviews and an interpretative phenomenological approach, this study explored experiences of transition from adolescence to adulthood in the context of chronic skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa). Seven themes emerged: (1) The Medical Journey; (2) Practical Difficulties; (3) Physical Impacts; (4) Psychological Impacts; (5) Self-Conscious Emotions; (6) Stigma; and (7) Building Resilience. Our findings add to our understanding of the difficulties experienced by young people with chronic skin conditions, particularly during adolescence. Our findings also offer insight into how researchers and practitioners can support these young people throughout their developmental journey from adolescence into young adulthood."

While research has extensively studied multisensory integration (MSI) using idealised, well-controlled stimuli, there is a need to understand this process in response to complex, naturalistic stimuli encountered in everyday life. This study investigated behavioural and neuronal MSI in neurotypical adults experiencing audio-visual speech within a naturalistic, social context. Our novel paradigm incorporated a broader social situational context, complete words, and speech-supporting iconic gestures, allowing for context-based pragmatics and semantic priors. We investigated MSI in the presence of unimodal (auditory or visual) or complementary, bimodal speech signals. During audio-visual speech trials, compared to unimodal trials, participants more accurately recognised spoken words and showed a more pronounced suppression of alpha power—an indicator of heightened integration load. Importantly, on the neuronal level, these effects surpassed mere summation of unimodal responses, suggesting non-linear MSI mechanisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that typically developing adults integrate audio-visual speech and gesture information to facilitate speech comprehension in noisy environments, highlighting the importance of studying MSI in ecologically valid contexts."

Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be self-structured by the people involved themselves. The latter hence vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. In the scientific study of executive functions, these different situations hence exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. To address the challenges of these type of situations, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses from the behaviour of the participants; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research which usually focus on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions."

Yet, a consensual framework that defines the evolutionary function of anxiety and distinguishes between its (mal)adaptive forms is lacking. The present work addresses this gap through the elaboration of a theoretical approach that integrates behavioral, biological, and cognitive processes across three threat-related emotions -—anxiety, anger, and fear— using Signal Detection Theory. We review a broad selection of relevant theory and research to reach a mathematical formalization allowing to mechanistically interpret outcomes related to these three emotions. We also propose methods for diagnosing the adaptive fit of the defensive emotion displayed in a given situation and characterizing the corresponding behavioral response. With the ability to account for a wide range of phenomena, this approach bears significant implications for theory and practice related to anxiety, anger, and fear."

However, the mechanisms of social cognitive dysfunction in SZ remain poorly understood, which impedes the design of novel interventions to improve outcomes. This pre-registered project (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JH5FC) examines the representation of social functioning in the brain’s functional architecture across early psychosis (EP) and SZ. The study contains two parts: a confirmatory and an exploratory portion. In the confirmatory portion, we identified specific resting-state brain connectivity disruptions evident in EP and SZ. We performed a seed-based connectivity analysis using brain regions associated with social cognitive dysfunction in SZ (based on a published review) to test whether aberrant functional connectivity observed in SZ was also present in EP. In the exploratory portion, we assessed the out-of-sample generalizability and precision of resting state connectivity-based predictive models of social cognition. We used machine learning to predict social cognition from whole-brain connectomes and established the generalizability of these brain-behavior relationships with out-of-sample testing and cross-validation (to handle confounding variables). Results reveal significant decreases between the left inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus that were evident in SZ but not EP. This connectivity profile is significantly associated with social cognition/functioning in both SZ and EP. Null predictive modeling results reveal the importance of out-of-sample evaluation, proper null hypothesis testing, and confound removal procedures. Overall, this work provides insights into the brain's functional architecture in SZ and EP. This work suggests that IFG-IPS connectivity profiles could be an important prognostic biomarker of social impairments and may be a target for future interventions focused on improved treatment outcomes related to social functioning."

Hamilton, Maya Dalack, Simone Imani Boyd, Jorgensen, Saskia Linnea, Melissa J. Dreier, Jas Sarna, David Brent","Background: Social media (SM) has received considerable attention as a potential risk factor for adolescent suicide. Few empirical studies, however, have examined adolescents’ daily negative and positive experiences on SM and its proximal impacts on suicidal ideation (SI), particularly using intensive monitoring designs.  Method: Adolescents (N= 60; 14-17 years; 49% girls; 62% LGBTQ+) recruited using SM across the United States and participated in an 8-week intensive monitoring protocol. Ecological momentary assessment (3 brief surveys per day) asked about negative and positive SM experiences and SI (passive and active). Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the within-person relationships between daily SM experiences (e.g., individual fluctuations compared to a person’s average) and SI, controlling for average levels of SM experiences, SM use screen time, and lifetime SI.  Results: Significant within-person effects of negative and positive SM experiences were associated with days when adolescents had SI. Specifically, on days when teens endorsed more frequent negative SM experiences than usual, they were more likely to report SI. However, more positive SM experiences than usual were associated with a lower likelihood of having SI. There were no significant effects of SM use (“screen time”) on SI or on the reverse associations of SI on next-day SM experiences.   Conclusions: Results indicate that SM experiences may be dynamic and modifiable risk and protective factors for SI in adolescents, whereas there is no effect of SM screen time on SI. Our results highlight that targeting negative SM experiences and augmenting the positive experiences on SM may be critical targets to improve teens’ mental health and prevent suicide, rather than focusing on limiting SM screen time."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/x4pvw,2024-02-26,Learning to Attenuate Myself A Predictive Processing Account of Bodily Awareness in Meditation,To be fetched,"The practice of meditation consists in allocating attention to sensory stimuli. As it is commonly known, attention allocation tends to increase both the cortical and the phenomenal response to the target. Yet, in deep contemplative states practitioners often report to feel a complete dissolution of body boundaries, i.e. the state of banga (in Pali). This phenomenon creates tension with existing literature on attention: How does attention decrease the perception of the sensory target instead of increasing it? This paper aims at solving the tension by examining computational, phenomenological, and embodied approaches to contemplative practices. For the sake of simplicity, the body-scan technique (Vipassana tradition) is taken as an exemplary practice that leads to the state of bhanga. This paper starts with the premise that the attentional processes are fundamentally interacting with somatic (i.e. bodily) processes and resulting subjective experience. Through a predictive processing account of the attentional processes of the body-scan, I propose that the body-scan enhances the accuracy of (low-level) predictions on somatosensory cues. This way, the resulting accurate posteriors accurately match the stream of ascendent prediction errors. Predictions matching predictions errors leads to what is called “(somato)sensory attenuation”, e.g. the attenuation of perceived (somato)sensory inputs. The “overly attenuated” body of the practitioner may render the phenomenology of the state of bhanga. Moreover, other effects of the body-scan on body perception are examined. By learning to flexibly update the model, the body-scan may allow better optimisation of the processing of sensory cues of the practitioner’s body. This explains the observed tendency of expert practitioners to develop increased body awareness. I conclude by addressing the relevance of contemplative practices for psychopathology, such as in cases of disrupted body awareness and depersonalisation. Finally, this paper also contributes significantly to embodied theories of cognition, as it further emphasises the role of somatic processes in the phenomenology of the self."

In this study, we examine the roles autonomy and relatedness play in the lives of N = 16 culturally diverse adolescents. Semi-structured interviews with adolescents of non-immigrant descent (n = 5), of second-generation immigrant descent (n = 5), and first-generation immigrants with experiences of flight (n = 6) were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: 1) Family and friends are most important in life, 2) Autonomy is a developmental privilege you can earn, 3) Too much autonomy is bad for you – humans need rules, and 4) I am not in control over my own future, school is. The findings highlight relatedness as most important for adolescents from all backgrounds. The importance and negotiation of autonomy varied across the groups of adolescents, however all adolescents accepted the necessity of rules for personal and societal well-being. Findings further highlight the importance of dismantling classist and assimilationist structures embedded in the German school system to enhance the autonomy, well-being and success of adolescents with diverse backgrounds and experiences."

Our results highlight autonomy and relatedness as multifaceted and separate psychological needs. Depending on the specific aspect of autonomy and relatedness, they may co-occur, be in conflict or enhance one another. Variations across gender and cultural self-identifications highlight the importance of appreciating cultural variations while also recognizing other sources of variation, such as gender, when examining autonomy and relatedness among adolescents. While no direct relationship between autonomy, relatedness, and identity commitment was found, fostering structured opportunities for engagement with heritage culture and national identity could be vital to promoting adolescent well-being."

In the attraction effect, apparently irrelevant dominated decoys have proven effective in shifting preferences in numerous laboratory experiments, yet its relevance in real-life consumer choices remains disputed.

In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate how these factors modulate the attraction effect: in particular, we systematically manipulate the number of decoys (study1), and the number of options available to decision makers (study2). Our findings provide a rich map of the effects of asymmetrically dominated decoys in larger multialternative decision contexts, suggesting that: (i) the attraction effect remains significant for up to 5 options; (ii) two converging decoys are more effective than one, but (iii) adding more can undermine the effect; (iv) compromise options have a peculiar dampening influence on decoys, making them ineffective at targeting the intermediate option."

This studyaims to explore the effectiveness of VR therapy in reducing anxiety and improvingoverall well-being among children with ASD. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative assessments of anxiety levels and qualitative insights into the subjective experiences of participants. The quantitative aspect involved a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 100children aged 6 to 12 years diagnosed with ASD. Participants were randomly assignedtoeither the experimental group, which received VR therapy sessions, or the control group, which received standard therapy. Anxiety levels were measured using standardizedscales at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up assessments conducted one monthafter the intervention. Additionally, demographic information and baseline anxiety levels were collected to ensure comparability between the two groups. Preliminary findings indicate a significant reduction in anxiety levels among childrenwhounderwent VR therapy compared to those receiving standard therapy. The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anxiety scores frombaseline to post-intervention and maintained these improvements at the one-monthfollow-up. Conversely, the control group exhibited marginal changes in anxiety levels over the same period. Qualitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews with participants andtheir caregivers provided valuable insights into the subjective experiences of childrenundergoing VR therapy. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis includedenhanced engagement, reduced fear of social interaction, and increased feelings of empowerment and control. Participants reported a sense of immersion and enjoyment during VR sessions, describing them as engaging and interactive. The study also examined potential moderators and mediators of treatment outcomes, including age, gender, ASD severity, and presence of comorbid conditions. Subgroupanalyses revealed differential treatment effects based on these variables, with younger children and those with milder forms of ASD experiencing greater benefits fromVRtherapy. Overall, the findings suggest that VR therapy holds promise as an effective interventionfor reducing anxiety levels in children with ASD. Its immersive and interactive natureappears to engage participants and create a sense of presence, leading to significant improvements in anxiety symptoms. Future research should further explore the long- term effects of VR therapy and investigate its mechanisms of action to optimizetreatment protocols and enhance outcomes for children with ASD."

In order to probe this link mechanistically and causally, there is a need to identify and measure specific health beliefs that can predict physical symptoms. In the present study, we address this need by developing and validating a novel scale to assess how people perceive their ability to cope with illnesses: the “Perception of Body's Immunity (PBI)” scale. Methods: Through three studies, we establish the PBI scale's validity, reliability, and its unique connection to various health indicators. Results: Study 1 (N= 206) demonstrates that the PBI scale has good internal consistency and structural validity. Study 2 (N= 132) replicates these findings. Notably, our results from both Studies exhibit significant associations between the PBI scale and physical health, specifically the experience of physical symptoms and daily functioning. This was especially evident among those with diverse clinical conditions (N=56). Finally, Study 3 (N= 87) reveals that PBI has good test-retest reliability, and prospectively predicts physical symptoms and daily functioning over time. Conclusions: We suggest that the PBI scale can be utilized as a valuable tool for researchers and healthcare providers, and provide insights into the interplay between beliefs and health outcomes."

Interestingly, the homogeneous groups (HH and/or LL) exhibited stronger movement synchrony and interbrain synchronization compared to the heterogeneous group. Importantly, a mediation analysis revealed that spontaneous and synchronized body movements between individuals contribute to interbrain synchronization, hence facilitating learning. This study therefore fills a critical gap in our understanding of how interpersonal transmission of information between individual brains, associated with behavioral entrainment, shapes social learning."

This studyaims to explore the effectiveness of VR therapy in reducing anxiety and improvingoverall well-being among children with ASD. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative assessments of anxiety levels and qualitative insights into the subjective experiences of participants. The quantitative aspect involved a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 100children aged 6 to 12 years diagnosed with ASD. Participants were randomly assignedtoeither the experimental group, which received VR therapy sessions, or the control group, which received standard therapy. Anxiety levels were measured using standardizedscales at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up assessments conducted one monthafter the intervention. Additionally, demographic information and baseline anxiety levels were collected to ensure comparability between the two groups. Preliminary findings indicate a significant reduction in anxiety levels among childrenwhounderwent VR therapy compared to those receiving standard therapy. The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anxiety scores frombaseline to post-intervention and maintained these improvements at the one-monthfollow-up. Conversely, the control group exhibited marginal changes in anxiety levels over the same period. Qualitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews with participants andtheir caregivers provided valuable insights into the subjective experiences of childrenundergoing VR therapy. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis includedenhanced engagement, reduced fear of social interaction, and increased feelings of empowerment and control. Participants reported a sense of immersion and enjoyment during VR sessions, describing them as engaging and interactive. The study also examined potential moderators and mediators of treatment outcomes, including age, gender, ASD severity, and presence of comorbid conditions. Subgroupanalyses revealed differential treatment effects based on these variables, with younger children and those with milder forms of ASD experiencing greater benefits fromVRtherapy. Overall, the findings suggest that VR therapy holds promise as an effective interventionfor reducing anxiety levels in children with ASD. Its immersive and interactive natureappears to engage participants and create a sense of presence, leading to significant improvements in anxiety symptoms. Future research should further explore the long- term effects of VR therapy and investigate its mechanisms of action to optimizetreatment protocols and enhance outcomes for children with ASD."

In order to probe this link mechanistically and causally, there is a need to identify and measure specific health beliefs that can predict physical symptoms. In the present study, we address this need by developing and validating a novel scale to assess how people perceive their ability to cope with illnesses: the “Perception of Body's Immunity (PBI)” scale. Methods: Through three studies, we establish the PBI scale's validity, reliability, and its unique connection to various health indicators. Results: Study 1 (N= 206) demonstrates that the PBI scale has good internal consistency and structural validity. Study 2 (N= 132) replicates these findings. Notably, our results from both Studies exhibit significant associations between the PBI scale and physical health, specifically the experience of physical symptoms and daily functioning. This was especially evident among those with diverse clinical conditions (N=56). Finally, Study 3 (N= 87) reveals that PBI has good test-retest reliability, and prospectively predicts physical symptoms and daily functioning over time. Conclusions: We suggest that the PBI scale can be utilized as a valuable tool for researchers and healthcare providers, and provide insights into the interplay between beliefs and health outcomes."

Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out applying the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) scale. From a population of 78 people, a sample of 59 participants was obtained who agreed to be part of the study. Results: The average age was 42.5 years. Compared to the results of the CBI scale, 46% of the participants present a mild level of burnout, 41% a moderate level, and 14% an elevated level. The personal dimension is the one that scores the most in all levels of burnout. Conclusions: It is important to propose interventions to reduce burnout in this mild to moderate stage and prevent it from evolving into severe burnout or appearing in those who do not have it."

Juang, Miriam Schwarzenthal","Autonomy and relatedness are important psychological constructs that are related to a critical task of adolescence, identity development. However, a detailed understanding of the different content of autonomy and relatedness is missing, including their co-occurrence, relationship to identity development, and possible cultural variations. A mixed-methods approach using essay and survey data of N=364 7th grade students (Mage=12.34 years, SDage=0.72, 50.55% female) was used to investigate the three aims of this study: explore (1) the content of autonomy and relatedness, (2) the co-occurrence of these contents, and (3) how these contents are related to heritage cultural and national identity commitment in German-only (n=145), German-hyphenated (n=127), and non-German (n=92) self-identifying adolescents. Our results highlight autonomy and relatedness as multifaceted and separate psychological needs. Depending on the specific aspect of autonomy and relatedness, they may co-occur, be in conflict or enhance one another. Variations across gender and cultural self-identifications highlight the importance of appreciating cultural variations while also recognizing other sources of variation, such as gender, when examining autonomy and relatedness among adolescents. While no direct relationship between autonomy, relatedness, and identity commitment was found, fostering structured opportunities for engagement with heritage culture and national identity could be vital to promoting adolescent well-being."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/x4pvw,2024-02-26,Learning to Attenuate Myself A Predictive Processing Account of Bodily Awareness in Meditation,Valeria Becattini,"The practice of meditation consists in allocating attention to sensory stimuli. As it is commonly known, attention allocation tends to increase both the cortical and the phenomenal response to the target. Yet, in deep contemplative states practitioners often report to feel a complete dissolution of body boundaries, i.e. the state of banga (in Pali). This phenomenon creates tension with existing literature on attention: How does attention decrease the perception of the sensory target instead of increasing it? This paper aims at solving the tension by examining computational, phenomenological, and embodied approaches to contemplative practices. For the sake of simplicity, the body-scan technique (Vipassana tradition) is taken as an exemplary practice that leads to the state of bhanga. This paper starts with the premise that the attentional processes are fundamentally interacting with somatic (i.e. bodily) processes and resulting subjective experience. Through a predictive processing account of the attentional processes of the body-scan, I propose that the body-scan enhances the accuracy of (low-level) predictions on somatosensory cues. This way, the resulting accurate posteriors accurately match the stream of ascendent prediction errors. Predictions matching predictions errors leads to what is called “(somato)sensory attenuation”, e.g. the attenuation of perceived (somato)sensory inputs. The “overly attenuated” body of the practitioner may render the phenomenology of the state of bhanga. Moreover, other effects of the body-scan on body perception are examined. By learning to flexibly update the model, the body-scan may allow better optimisation of the processing of sensory cues of the practitioner’s body. This explains the observed tendency of expert practitioners to develop increased body awareness. I conclude by addressing the relevance of contemplative practices for psychopathology, such as in cases of disrupted body awareness and depersonalisation. Finally, this paper also contributes significantly to embodied theories of cognition, as it further emphasises the role of somatic processes in the phenomenology of the self."

Juang, Julia Marie Christina Wenzing","Adolescence is an important period of development, as adolescents explore who they are and want to be, while at the same time negotiating autonomy and relatedness within their social and cultural contexts. In this study, we examine the roles autonomy and relatedness play in the lives of N = 16 culturally diverse adolescents. Semi-structured interviews with adolescents of non-immigrant descent (n = 5), of second-generation immigrant descent (n = 5), and first-generation immigrants with experiences of flight (n = 6) were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: 1) Family and friends are most important in life, 2) Autonomy is a developmental privilege you can earn, 3) Too much autonomy is bad for you – humans need rules, and 4) I am not in control over my own future, school is. The findings highlight relatedness as most important for adolescents from all backgrounds. The importance and negotiation of autonomy varied across the groups of adolescents, however all adolescents accepted the necessity of rules for personal and societal well-being. Findings further highlight the importance of dismantling classist and assimilationist structures embedded in the German school system to enhance the autonomy, well-being and success of adolescents with diverse backgrounds and experiences."

In daily life, people update their impressions of others’ traits using rich verbal and nonverbal information. However, quantifying this rich, naturalistic information is challenging.  Here we leverage novel computational tools to characterize multimodal information streams in audiovisual narratives, and examine their contributions to dynamic trait impression updating. Across three studies (N = 817), we find that people update face-based first impressions of most traits after viewing audiovisual narratives. By examining the dynamic process of impression updating, we find that how and when people updated impressions were most strongly predicted by unique information in targets’ voice, followed by head and face movements, and semantic content. Perceivers’ own affect, attitudes, and personality also predicted impression updating. These findings comprehensively characterize the informational drivers of naturalistic trait impression updating."

Poor cognitive flexibility is one of the endophenotypic candidates of the disorder but few studies examined its association with weight status. The study aimed to evaluate the relationships between cognitive flexibility performances and nutritional status indices (BMI; Body composition: fat mass: FM ; fat-free mass: FFM) at different stages of the disorder.  Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cognitive flexibility (TAP 2.1 subtest) and BMI, FM and FFM,  anxious and depressive (HAD), and eating disorder (EDE-Q) symptomatology were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses in a cohort of  AN inpatients evaluated at hospital admission (N=167) and discharge (N=94).  Results: We found no or negligible associations between nutritional status markers, HAD or EDE-Q scores and cognitive flexibility performances either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Performances did not significantly differ between the restrictive and binge-purging subtypes.  Conclusion: In agreement with the Cognitive-Interpersonal model of AN, cognitive flexibility is independent of nutritional status as well as the AN subtype. It is also independent of the levels of anxious, depressive, or ED symptoms. A new therapeutic approach targeting cognitive flexibility and intolerance to change could benefit severely emaciated people with AN, regardless of disease’s subtype and level of dysphoria."

Here, we report a replication and extension of one of the few studies of this topic, Experiment 2 in De Vries et al. (2015).

The present pre-registered replication (n = 516) did not find support for this effect, with very little difference in perceived greenwashing depending on communicated motive, d = -0.09 [-0.38, 0.21]. As extensions, we included a condition where a mixed motive (both environment and profits) was communicated, tested the effect using a different type of company than the original, included a measure of general attitudes to the company in addition to perceived greenwashing, and included measures of individual differences in attitudes towards corporate social responsibility and belief in climate change. The most noteworthy exploratory finding was that attitudes were more positive when an environmental or a mixed motive was communicated rather than a profit motive."

A polygenic score (PGS) approach was used to index the genome-wide propensity for educational attainment. Multiple regression analyses examined interactions between polygenic propensity for educational attainment and positive affect on sleep.

Detailed introductions in existing R libraries and practical examples using R code are provided to guide users in both implementing and optimising ensemble clustering models. We then include simulation studies of real-world data to demonstrate the substantial benefit of ensemble clustering compared with single-run clustering models. The resources presented here will enable researchers to apply advanced clustering techniques to decompose heterogeneous and complex psychological data into stable subgroups."

They preserve and reinforce national and international narratives, and as such play a crucial role in the social psychological divides within political spaces. This paper explores our perceptions of these embodied divides and the role of memorials in the maintenance of political narratives. We conducted text analysis of over 158,000 online memorial reviews to explore sentiment differences between traditional and counter-memorials, and found that these memorials elicited quantitatively different reactions from visitors. We discuss the implications of these findings in the realm of contemporary political understandings and narratives. This research addresses a critical gap in understanding how physical memorials, as representations of past geopolitical events, influence public perception of political narratives in the present and future. By examining the role of memorials in the spatial and social psychological dimensions of politics, we provide novel insights and contributions to the burgeoning field of social psychology in understanding macro-level phenomena."

However, the difference in culture brings into question the validity of their findings in other contexts. To determine its applicability specifically in an Asian context, this study aims to replicate the study at KK’s Women and Children Hospital (KKH), focusing on PEM physicians. While the findings are limited to a single hospital, they provide valuable insights into challenges encountered by PEM physicians.   Methods: A general qualitative approach was used through semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited through email. Interviews were conducted via Zoom and subsequently de-identified and transcribed. The data was coded manually through thematic analysis, identifying key themes.  Results: Fifteen PEM physicians were interviewed. Participants conceptualized PSM through technical aspects and measured competence through objective and subjective measures. General motivation themes found the (1) desire to provide optimal patient care, (2) procedural competence as part of the identity of a PEM physician who teaches and performs procedures, and (3) desire for choice when alternatives are present. Barriers included limited time, support, and opportunities.  Conclusion: The study found that the themes from the original study are applicable in KKH, featuring SDT concepts prominently.

Yet, despite its hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost-benefit decision-making. To examine this question, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when it was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two cognitive domains, and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role for the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost- benefit decision-making."

Using a nationally representative longitudinal U.S. sample of 27,986 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, we assessed racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated loss of family members over the lifespan.

Participants (N = 66) were randomized into three groups; no-vision physical practice, observational practice and no-practice control. Participants practiced and then visually and kinesthetically imagined two hand gesture sequences. Mental chronometry, a movement time (MT) congruency measure, and MI quality ratings were used to assess MI. As predicted, physical practice produced higher ratings for kinesthetic MI and observational practice elicited higher ratings for visual MI. However, physical practice did not result in greater temporal congruency between imagined/executed MTs in comparison to other groups. We conclude that MI is only partially tied to the motor representation as physical practice was not essential for enhancing MI quality. The motor representation developed with no-vision practice improved perceptions of kinesthetic MI, but without the expected congruence in timing, questioning the equivalence between execution and MI."

Prevailing research suggests that information’s valence plays a central role in shaping our self-views. However, the need for stability within the self-concept structure and the inherent alignment of positive feedback with the pre-existing self-views of healthy individuals might mask valence and congruence effects. In this study (N = 30, undergraduates) we orthogonalized feedback valence and self-congruence effects to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of self-relevant feedback processing and self-concept updating. We found that participants had a preference for integrating self-congruent and dismissing self-incongruent feedback, regardless of its valence. Consistently, EEG results revealed that feedback congruence, but not feedback valence, is swiftly detected during early processing stages. Our findings diverge from the accepted notion that self-concept updating is based on the selective incorporation of positive information.

Both have also been claimed to enhance pupil’s cognitive and academic performances. However, existing research evidence is inconsistent in finding support for such claims and there are no studies directly comparing the two methods. Consequently, this study investigated the acute effects of lessons taught using PAL or incorporating MBs on pupil’s Cognitive and Academic Performances (AP) and PA Levels. METHOD: 355 children (aged 8-10 years) from three schools in Northern England participated in a cluster-randomised trial. Classes of pupils were assigned to participate in one of the three types of, 45 min long, mathematics lesson (Lesson-type: PAL, MB or Traditional). Physical activity during lessons was measured using accelerometery and pre- and post-lesson participants completed a battery of standardised assessments assessing of their Maths Fluency (measure of AP) and Cognitive (Attentional) Control. RESULTS: Compared to Traditional (sedentary) lessons, PAL and MB lessons were associated with pupils being significantly more Moderately to Vigorously Physically Active during lesson time (95% CI: +9.86 to 11.06 min). PAL lessons also reduced time spent sedentary by a significantly larger margin than lessons incorporating a MB (95% CI: -16.60 to 21.70 min). However, variation over time in Maths Fluency and Attentional Control measures were not significantly moderated by Lesson-Type, with Bayes Factors indicating evidence in favour of null hypothesis (All Time X Lesson-Type interactions had a BF10 ranging from 0.29 to 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Both PAL and MBs effectively increase student’s PA levels during curriculum time. These benefits do not come at the expense of academic or cognitive performances but neither do these outcomes appear acutely enhanced."

Background: White individuals are becoming numerical minorities in many Western European cities, despite persistent white supremacy. In this context, some white individuals embrace diversity, whereas others perceive it as a threat. Understanding white parents’ RES in diverse contexts is crucial, as parents play a pivotal role in shaping their children's beliefs and behaviors. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with 12 white German parents of elementary school aged children and employed reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: We identified four main themes: silence about race, adhering to white normativity, overtly reinforcing racism, and diversity socialization.  Conclusion: RES among white parents is a mechanism that can uphold or resist white supremacy. All parents’ messaging included aspects of both, indicating an ongoing embrace of white normativity and supremacy in this superdiverse context, but also an emerging consciousness of own privileges. Implications: Fostering environments that reject white supremacy demands change at all systemic levels. Interventions to bridge the gap between emerging awareness and concrete actions, guiding parents in exploring and addressing racial-ethnic topics, are one vital puzzle piece to disrupt the intergenerational transmission of racism."

Between-person and within-person temporal networks were computed, with mostly stable centrality coefficients. Networks were denser when participants were not exercising previously. Autoregressive effects of several symptoms, including binge-eating, overeating, or weighing oneself, were attenuated after exercise. In temporal networks, stable associations across exercise levels mostly involved cognitive-affective symptoms. Other pairwise associations disappeared after exercising, including effects of desire to be thinner on thinking about dieting, vomiting on weighing, and overeating on fear of weight gain. This highlights the complex effects of exercise on ED symptoms in daily life and calls for novel studies investigating mechanisms of acute exercise in EDs to inform treatments targeting detrimental long-term effects of maladaptive exercise."

The current study approached this question by examining the role of domain-specific KAS for the development of professional knowledge (PK) in vocational education and training (VET). Our analyses recurred on (1) school achievement tests that assess domain-specific KAS in chemistry, physics, and math, (2) occupation-specific achievement tests in the same domains to assess PK (and its development) in VET, and (3) comparisons between different VET programs to isolate the effects of learning opportunities on PK acquisition over time and their interaction with KAS. Data stemmed from a sample of N = 2,775 trainees from three VET groups (chemical laboratory assistants, technicians, and industrial clerks) that are characterized by a focus on different knowledge domains. Our findings suggest that VET does not affect the knowledge assessed with school achievement tests. Instead, VET programs provide learning opportunities that facilitate the acquisition of domain-specific PK. In addition, KAS matters for subsequent learning in VET because it (1) determines the level of PK with which trainees enter VET and (2) enables trainees to make better use of the learning opportunities to develop their professional knowledge."

We address this gap by introducing a socially correlated bandit task that accommodates payoff differences among participants, allowing for the study of social learning under more realistic conditions. Our novel Social Generalization (SG) model, tested through evolutionary simulations and two online experiments, outperforms existing models by incorporating social information into the generalization process, but treated as noisier than individual observations. Our findings suggest that human social learning is more flexible than previously believed, with the SG model indicating a potential resource-rational trade-off where social learning partially replaces individual exploration. This research highlights the flexibility of humans social learning, allowing us to integrate social information from others with different preferences, skills, or goals."

Adopting this assumption clarifies the questions of the constituents (descriptive beliefs – whose content remains to be investigated) and associates (e.g., prescriptive beliefs, behaviours) of conspiracy mentality. It also clarifies the causal mechanisms through which conspiracy mentality may foster the endorsement of specific conspiracy beliefs (e.g., through motivated reasoning), and vice versa (e.g., through inductive reasoning).

In the current study, using longitudinal vocabulary data from children learning Norwegian, we ask whether the phonological connectivity of a word to words that the child already knows or words in the child’s environment predicts the likelihood of the child learning that word across development. We compare three different measures of phonological connectivity that have been used in the literature to-date. The results suggest that the early vocabulary grows predominantly in a rich-get-richer manner, where word learning is predicted by the connectivity of a word to already known words. However, word learning is, to a lesser extent, also influenced by the connectivity of a word to words in the child’s linguistic environment. Our results highlight the promise of using longitudinal data to better understand the factors that influence vocabulary development and the insights to be gained from analyzing different measures of the same construct."

Prevailing research suggests that information’s valence plays a central role in shaping our self-views. However, the need for stability within the self-concept structure and the inherent alignment of positive feedback with the pre-existing self-views of healthy individuals might mask valence and congruence effects. In this study (N = 30, undergraduates) we orthogonalized feedback valence and self-congruence effects to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of self-relevant feedback processing and self-concept updating. We found that participants had a preference for integrating self-congruent and dismissing self-incongruent feedback, regardless of its valence. Consistently, EEG results revealed that feedback congruence, but not feedback valence, is swiftly detected during early processing stages. Our findings diverge from the accepted notion that self-concept updating is based on the selective incorporation of positive information. These findings offer novel insights into self-concept dynamics, with implications for the understanding of psychopathological conditions."

I also attempt to further clarify the concept of conspiracy mentality. Building on Imhoff and Bruder’s (2014) conceptualisation of conspiracy mentality as a generalised political attitude, I propose to adopt the working assumption that conspiracy mentality consists in a worldview, that is, a set of descriptive beliefs and assumptions about how the world functions. Adopting this assumption clarifies the questions of the constituents (descriptive beliefs – whose content remains to be investigated) and associates (e.g., prescriptive beliefs, behaviours) of conspiracy mentality. It also clarifies the causal mechanisms through which conspiracy mentality may foster the endorsement of specific conspiracy beliefs (e.g., through motivated reasoning), and vice versa (e.g., through inductive reasoning). I propose five basic working assumptions to facilitate research on this topic."

Wu","There has been much progress in understanding human social learning, including recent studies integrating social information into the reinforcement learning framework. Yet previous studies often assume identical payoffs between observer and demonstrator, overlooking the diversity of real-world interactions. We address this gap by introducing a socially correlated bandit task that accommodates payoff differences among participants, allowing for the study of social learning under more realistic conditions. Our novel Social Generalization (SG) model, tested through evolutionary simulations and two online experiments, outperforms existing models by incorporating social information into the generalization process, but treated as noisier than individual observations. Our findings suggest that human social learning is more flexible than previously believed, with the SG model indicating a potential resource-rational trade-off where social learning partially replaces individual exploration. This research highlights the flexibility of humans social learning, allowing us to integrate social information from others with different preferences, skills, or goals."

The current study approached this question by examining the role of domain-specific KAS for the development of professional knowledge (PK) in vocational education and training (VET). Our analyses recurred on (1) school achievement tests that assess domain-specific KAS in chemistry, physics, and math, (2) occupation-specific achievement tests in the same domains to assess PK (and its development) in VET, and (3) comparisons between different VET programs to isolate the effects of learning opportunities on PK acquisition over time and their interaction with KAS. Data stemmed from a sample of N = 2,775 trainees from three VET groups (chemical laboratory assistants, technicians, and industrial clerks) that are characterized by a focus on different knowledge domains. Our findings suggest that VET does not affect the knowledge assessed with school achievement tests. Instead, VET programs provide learning opportunities that facilitate the acquisition of domain-specific PK. In addition, KAS matters for subsequent learning in VET because it (1) determines the level of PK with which trainees enter VET and (2) enables trainees to make better use of the learning opportunities to develop their professional knowledge."

Yet exercising may temporarily attenuate ED symptoms, but whether exercise also affects network structure and pairwise associations of ED symptoms remained unclear. We used a novel approach called Moderated Multilevel Graphical Vector Autoregression to estimate changes in psychopathology networks from before to after exercising in ecological momentary assessment data from 102 individuals with EDs across multiple days (M = 9.65, SD = 8.26; range: 0 – 30 days) at 4 times daily. Between-person and within-person temporal networks were computed, with mostly stable centrality coefficients. Networks were denser when participants were not exercising previously. Autoregressive effects of several symptoms, including binge-eating, overeating, or weighing oneself, were attenuated after exercise. In temporal networks, stable associations across exercise levels mostly involved cognitive-affective symptoms. Other pairwise associations disappeared after exercising, including effects of desire to be thinner on thinking about dieting, vomiting on weighing, and overeating on fear of weight gain. This highlights the complex effects of exercise on ED symptoms in daily life and calls for novel studies investigating mechanisms of acute exercise in EDs to inform treatments targeting detrimental long-term effects of maladaptive exercise."

Background: White individuals are becoming numerical minorities in many Western European cities, despite persistent white supremacy. In this context, some white individuals embrace diversity, whereas others perceive it as a threat. Understanding white parents’ RES in diverse contexts is crucial, as parents play a pivotal role in shaping their children's beliefs and behaviors. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with 12 white German parents of elementary school aged children and employed reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: We identified four main themes: silence about race, adhering to white normativity, overtly reinforcing racism, and diversity socialization.  Conclusion: RES among white parents is a mechanism that can uphold or resist white supremacy. All parents’ messaging included aspects of both, indicating an ongoing embrace of white normativity and supremacy in this superdiverse context, but also an emerging consciousness of own privileges. Implications: Fostering environments that reject white supremacy demands change at all systemic levels. Interventions to bridge the gap between emerging awareness and concrete actions, guiding parents in exploring and addressing racial-ethnic topics, are one vital puzzle piece to disrupt the intergenerational transmission of racism."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gfsqk,2024-02-23,Pre-retirement work disengagement? Examining associations of job and leisure satisfaction with life satisfaction up to retirement,To be fetched,"A satisfying job is important for workers across their work lifespan. However, before workers retire, it is often assumed that they start to become less attached to their workplace and focus on other life areas instead. This supposed disengagement process, however, is not well understood. To date, few studies have examined whether the importance that an individual attaches to their job changes as they approach retirement. Likewise, it is not known which life areas become more important in anticipation of retirement. In the present study, we used longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 2,866) to investigate if the within-person associations between job and life satisfaction and between leisure and life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. We found that in this sample, job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time, but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. We discuss these findings in the context of work disengagement and self-regulation theories and highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment."

Finally, we conduct our own initial analysis of the 64 data sets in our data base, assessing the reliability of individual differences. The analysis highlights that reliability is generally low, and provides insights into planning future studies. For example researchers should consider to increase the number of trials per person and condition to at least 400.

This advantage is also reflected in their different processing and representation in the human brain. In this electrophysiological study, we explored the interplay of concreteness as a continuous measure and task effects on word processing. Electrophysiological responses of 58 participants were recorded during semantic, affective, and grammatical decision tasks on words parametrically varied in concreteness. Our findings uncovered a fine-grained concreteness effect within four distinct spatiotemporal windows when a coding of semantic information is required. In the semantic decision task, we detected a higher parietal positivity within the P300 time range and an increased left temporo-lateral negative-going amplitude for less concrete concepts. We also identified a concreteness effect characterised by greater negativity in the N400 component. In the affective task, we observed a more pronounced parietal P600-like component for more abstract concepts. Interestingly, we found that the neural representational similarity (starting from 450 ms with a widespread scalp distribution) conformed to the concreteness similarity among concepts (regardless of the task), implying that their semantic representations may be characterised along the concreteness dimension in the brain. Our study transcends the conventional dichotomy of abstract versus concrete words, unearthing not only varied processing dynamics along the concreteness dimension but also distinct fine-grained neural representations. This novel insight positions concreteness as a structural dimension, enriching our comprehension of how the brain organises and processes semantic information."

Unfortunately, there is high between-study variability in the definition of mixed-handedness, leading to a major methodological problem in clinical laterality research and endangering replicability and comparability of research findings. Adding to this challenge is the fact that sometimes researchers use the concepts of mixed-handedness and ambidexterity interchangeably. Therefore, having a consensus on how to determine mixed-handedness and how to distinguish it from ambidexterity is crucial for clinical laterality research. To this end, hand preference and hand performance data from more than 600 participants from the Dortmund Vital Study (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05155397), a population-based study in Germany, was analyzed to ascertain an optimal classification to determine mixed-handedness and ambidexterity. Using a combination of latent class analyses, effect size determination, and comparisons with the existing literature, we establish that an LQ cut-off criterion of +/-60 for mixed-handedness is optimal for future clinical laterality studies. Moreover, we show that mixed-handedness and ambidexterity are not identical and that the terms should not be used interchangeably. We further highlight the need for a consensus on how to mathematically determine ambidexterity as results of existing categorization schemes largely differ."

However, current training methods often lack sufficient opportunities for realistic practice. This study details a three-phase development and evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) application for disability support staff to safely build de-escalation skills through simulated interactions. The first phase involved creating VR prototype scenarios depicting escalations with teen clients. Next, content validation by 12 disability-support experts refined the scenarios to confirm appropriateness and realism. Finally, a pilot study tested the tool’s usability and examined initial construct validity in 20 participants. The prototype achieved high usability ratings (average 81.0 (SD 10.7) on the System Usability Scale), and a positive correlation between VR performance and empathy levels were found (Pearson’s r = 0.487, p = 0.035). The promising results highlight the VR application’s potential as a transformative training tool. Future research should expand scenario diversity and compare VR with traditional methods to establish its efficacy in diverse settings and offer a path to enhance staff capabilities in challenging environments."

Here, we examined the joint role of maths anxiety (MA) and maths motivation (MM; self-efficacy and interest in maths) on STEM career choice in emerging adulthood using self-reported data from 7,908 Twins Early Development Study participants collected at ages ~16 (MM), ~18 (MA) and ~21 (STEM career choice). We found that MA and MM were associated with STEM career choice (r=-0.23 and r=0.28, respectively). However, MM was a stronger independent predictor for STEM career choice (OR=2.11) than MA (OR=0.79), which did not predict STEM career choice after adjusting for maths achievement. Notably, MM was predictive of STEM career choices in both male (OR=1.95) and female (OR=2.72) cohorts, while MA showed a predictive relationship only in the male cohort (OR=0.63). These results highlight the importance of nurturing maths motivation in interventions designed to bridge the STEM skills gap for all genders. Future research should consider the co-development of maths anxiety and maths motivation across development to better understand their influence on STEM career paths."

We use a simulation approach to evaluate the performance of these three approaches across different conditions, including varying sample sizes and varying number of assessment waves. Our simulation study reproduced the problematic between-person estimates and showed that saturated GGM estimation (with Cholesky decomposition) yields credible contemporaneous and temporal estimates, corroborating its use in prior empirical research.

Limb immobilisation has been associated with decrease in corticomotor efficiency and atypical multi-sensory integration. The present study explored the role of predisposition to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation-like experiences in maintaining corticomotor efficiency by rTMS stimulation. Twelve healthy participants were recruited to participate in a limb immobilisation within-subject paradigm. All participants completed two trait-based measures (relating to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation experiences and a state-based measure (where skin conductance responses were measured to a fake blood-giving procedure) indexing interoceptive vulnerability. Cortical excitability was measured by motor evoked potential (MEP) responses to single-pulse TMS in a stepwise procedure for each day of immobilisation. Participants were then randomised into a treatment group (n = 6) who received six 1.5 seconds 50 Hz repetitive inter-pulse trains at 60s intervals and a sham group (n = 6) per day of immobilisation. The results indicated that although the stimulation paradigm was successful in increasing cortical excitability initially, these effects were not maintained throughout the immobilisation period and MEPs evidenced a continual decrease in amplitude over time. Stratification of the participants based on trait-based and state-based measures did not produce any reliable findings. Taken together, this indicated that the stimulation paradigm in isolation was insufficient in maintaining cortical excitability and that baseline brain states are an important consideration for future alternative therapeutic paradigms. Theoretical and methodological improvements are discussed."

Employing the contingent paradigm, participants with varying degrees of motor dominance were exposed to stimuli depicting left or right human hands in the corresponding visual hemifields. Stimuli were either passively observed or evoked by voluntary button-presses with the dominant or non-dominant hand, in a manner that was either congruent or incongruent with stimulus laterality and hemifield. Early occipital responses (C1 and P1 components) revealed modulations consistent with sensory attenuation (SA) for self-evoked stimuli. Our findings suggest that sensory attenuation during the initial stages of visual processing (C1 component) is a general phenomenon across all degrees of handedness and stimulus/movement combinations. However, the degree of C1 suppression was modulated by handedness and movement-stimulus congruency, reflecting stronger SA in right-handed participants for stimuli depicting the right hand, when elicited by actions of the corresponding hand. P1 modulation suggested concurrent but opposing influences of attention and sensory prediction, with more pronounced suppression following button-presses over the hemisphere contralateral to movement, especially in left-handed individuals. We suggest that effects of motor dominance on the degree of SA may stem from functional/anatomical asymmetries in the processing of body parts (C1) and attention networks (P1). Overall, our results demonstrate the modulating effect of hand dominance and movement-outcome congruency on SA, underscoring the need for deeper exploration of their interplay. Additional empirical evidence in this direction could substantiate a premotor account for action-associated modulation of early sensory processing in the visual domain."

Our simulation study reproduced the problematic between-person estimates and showed that saturated GGM estimation (with Cholesky decomposition) yields credible contemporaneous and temporal estimates, corroborating its use in prior empirical research. Not modeling between-person covariances entirely resulted in low specificity. This study highlights the importance of data volume, showing that larger sample sizes or increased assessment waves significantly improve model performance. These insights may inform study design and data collection strategies and provide guidelines for selecting estimation methods."

Here, we examined the joint role of maths anxiety (MA) and maths motivation (MM; self-efficacy and interest in maths) on STEM career choice in emerging adulthood using self-reported data from 7,908 Twins Early Development Study participants collected at ages ~16 (MM), ~18 (MA) and ~21 (STEM career choice). We found that MA and MM were associated with STEM career choice (r=-0.23 and r=0.28, respectively). However, MM was a stronger independent predictor for STEM career choice (OR=2.11) than MA (OR=0.79), which did not predict STEM career choice after adjusting for maths achievement. Notably, MM was predictive of STEM career choices in both male (OR=1.95) and female (OR=2.72) cohorts, while MA showed a predictive relationship only in the male cohort (OR=0.63). These results highlight the importance of nurturing maths motivation in interventions designed to bridge the STEM skills gap for all genders. Future research should consider the co-development of maths anxiety and maths motivation across development to better understand their influence on STEM career paths."

Employing the contingent paradigm, participants with varying degrees of motor dominance were exposed to stimuli depicting left or right human hands in the corresponding visual hemifields. Stimuli were either passively observed or evoked by voluntary button-presses with the dominant or non-dominant hand, in a manner that was either congruent or incongruent with stimulus laterality and hemifield. Early occipital responses (C1 and P1 components) revealed modulations consistent with sensory attenuation (SA) for self-evoked stimuli. Our findings suggest that sensory attenuation during the initial stages of visual processing (C1 component) is a general phenomenon across all degrees of handedness and stimulus/movement combinations. However, the degree of C1 suppression was modulated by handedness and movement-stimulus congruency, reflecting stronger SA in right-handed participants for stimuli depicting the right hand, when elicited by actions of the corresponding hand. P1 modulation suggested concurrent but opposing influences of attention and sensory prediction, with more pronounced suppression following button-presses over the hemisphere contralateral to movement, especially in left-handed individuals. We suggest that effects of motor dominance on the degree of SA may stem from functional/anatomical asymmetries in the processing of body parts (C1) and attention networks (P1). Overall, our results demonstrate the modulating effect of hand dominance and movement-outcome congruency on SA, underscoring the need for deeper exploration of their interplay. Additional empirical evidence in this direction could substantiate a premotor account for action-associated modulation of early sensory processing in the visual domain."

Gajewski, Mauro Larra, Edmund Wascher, Erhan Genç, Sebastian Ocklenburg","An increased prevalence of mixed-handedness has been reported in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, there is high between-study variability in the definition of mixed-handedness, leading to a major methodological problem in clinical laterality research and endangering replicability and comparability of research findings. Adding to this challenge is the fact that sometimes researchers use the concepts of mixed-handedness and ambidexterity interchangeably. Therefore, having a consensus on how to determine mixed-handedness and how to distinguish it from ambidexterity is crucial for clinical laterality research. To this end, hand preference and hand performance data from more than 600 participants from the Dortmund Vital Study (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05155397), a population-based study in Germany, was analyzed to ascertain an optimal classification to determine mixed-handedness and ambidexterity. Using a combination of latent class analyses, effect size determination, and comparisons with the existing literature, we establish that an LQ cut-off criterion of +/-60 for mixed-handedness is optimal for future clinical laterality studies. Moreover, we show that mixed-handedness and ambidexterity are not identical and that the terms should not be used interchangeably. We further highlight the need for a consensus on how to mathematically determine ambidexterity as results of existing categorization schemes largely differ."

Haaf, Madlen Hoffstadt, Sven Lesche","Publicly available data are required 1. to assess the reproducibility of each individual finding in the literature, and 2. to promote the reuse of data for a more efficient use of participants' time and public resources. Current data sharing efforts are well suited for the first goal; yet, they do not sufficiently address the second goal. Here, we show how structured collections of open data can be useful as they allow a larger community of researchers easy access to a large body of data from their own research area. We introduce the Attentional Control Data Collection, an SQL data base for attentional control experiments. We illustrate the structure of the data base, how it can be easily accessed using a shiny app and an R-package, and how researchers can contribute data from their studies to the data base. Finally, we conduct our own initial analysis of the 64 data sets in our data base, assessing the reliability of individual differences. The analysis highlights that reliability is generally low, and provides insights into planning future studies. For example researchers should consider to increase the number of trials per person and condition to at least 400. The analysis highlights how an open data base like ACDC can aid meta-analytic efforts as well as methodological innovation."

This advantage is also reflected in their different processing and representation in the human brain. In this electrophysiological study, we explored the interplay of concreteness as a continuous measure and task effects on word processing. Electrophysiological responses of 58 participants were recorded during semantic, affective, and grammatical decision tasks on words parametrically varied in concreteness. Our findings uncovered a fine-grained concreteness effect within four distinct spatiotemporal windows when a coding of semantic information is required. In the semantic decision task, we detected a higher parietal positivity within the P300 time range and an increased left temporo-lateral negative-going amplitude for less concrete concepts. We also identified a concreteness effect characterised by greater negativity in the N400 component. In the affective task, we observed a more pronounced parietal P600-like component for more abstract concepts. Interestingly, we found that the neural representational similarity (starting from 450 ms with a widespread scalp distribution) conformed to the concreteness similarity among concepts (regardless of the task), implying that their semantic representations may be characterised along the concreteness dimension in the brain. Our study transcends the conventional dichotomy of abstract versus concrete words, unearthing not only varied processing dynamics along the concreteness dimension but also distinct fine-grained neural representations. This novel insight positions concreteness as a structural dimension, enriching our comprehension of how the brain organises and processes semantic information."

Examining associations of job and leisure satisfaction with life satisfaction up to retirement,"Georg Henning, Graciela Muniz-Terrera, Andreas Stenling, Sophie Potter, Martin Hyde","A satisfying job is important for workers across their work lifespan. However, before workers retire, it is often assumed that they start to become less attached to their workplace and focus on other life areas instead. This supposed disengagement process, however, is not well understood. To date, few studies have examined whether the importance that an individual attaches to their job changes as they approach retirement. Likewise, it is not known which life areas become more important in anticipation of retirement. In the present study, we used longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 2,866) to investigate if the within-person associations between job and life satisfaction and between leisure and life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. We found that in this sample, job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time, but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. We discuss these findings in the context of work disengagement and self-regulation theories and highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment."

However, current training methods often lack sufficient opportunities for realistic practice. This study details a three-phase development and evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) application for disability support staff to safely build de-escalation skills through simulated interactions. The first phase involved creating VR prototype scenarios depicting escalations with teen clients. Next, content validation by 12 disability-support experts refined the scenarios to confirm appropriateness and realism. Finally, a pilot study tested the tool’s usability and examined initial construct validity in 20 participants. The prototype achieved high usability ratings (average 81.0 (SD 10.7) on the System Usability Scale), and a positive correlation between VR performance and empathy levels were found (Pearson’s r = 0.487, p = 0.035). The promising results highlight the VR application’s potential as a transformative training tool. Future research should expand scenario diversity and compare VR with traditional methods to establish its efficacy in diverse settings and offer a path to enhance staff capabilities in challenging environments."

Limb immobilisation has been associated with decrease in corticomotor efficiency and atypical multi-sensory integration. The present study explored the role of predisposition to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation-like experiences in maintaining corticomotor efficiency by rTMS stimulation. Twelve healthy participants were recruited to participate in a limb immobilisation within-subject paradigm. All participants completed two trait-based measures (relating to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation experiences and a state-based measure (where skin conductance responses were measured to a fake blood-giving procedure) indexing interoceptive vulnerability. Cortical excitability was measured by motor evoked potential (MEP) responses to single-pulse TMS in a stepwise procedure for each day of immobilisation. Participants were then randomised into a treatment group (n = 6) who received six 1.5 seconds 50 Hz repetitive inter-pulse trains at 60s intervals and a sham group (n = 6) per day of immobilisation. The results indicated that although the stimulation paradigm was successful in increasing cortical excitability initially, these effects were not maintained throughout the immobilisation period and MEPs evidenced a continual decrease in amplitude over time. Stratification of the participants based on trait-based and state-based measures did not produce any reliable findings. Taken together, this indicated that the stimulation paradigm in isolation was insufficient in maintaining cortical excitability and that baseline brain states are an important consideration for future alternative therapeutic paradigms. Theoretical and methodological improvements are discussed."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/skdcp,2024-02-23,Triple definition or explanation of consciousness,To be fetched,"The author argues in this paper that consciousness may never be defined or explained with entities and properties, neither with brains and neurons, nor with particles, waves, and fields.   Instead, a system is proposed in this paper, with matter, energy and lives as its components, and with all its components defined as changes. The definitions or explanations of consciousness based on the systematic relationships among these components are: •	Ontologically, consciousness is universal, since it may only be the systematic distinction between matter and energy.   •	Epistemologically, consciousness is unique, since it may only be the energy qualified systematically by the matter. •	Semantically, consciousness is neither the cause nor the effect of mental activities, since it may only be languages.    To deny its ontology means to be a dualist. To deny its epistemology means to be a Platonist. And to deny its semantics means to be an animist or panpsychist. None of them may contribute anything to neuroscience or artificial intelligence.   Compared with matter and energy, life is the more difficult part of this definition and explanation, also an indispensable part since life is the only cause or effect of matter and energy. If without life, matter and energy by themselves cannot be the explanation of agency or intentional action, nor the explanation of learning and knowledge. Moreover, a system only with matter and energy as its components is fundamentally against birth, death, development, and evolution. Neither of them may explain why everything including us and our cosmos must be created but nothing may remain forever. And the only reason why there is consciousness is that it may be the birth or death of lives.   Such defined or explained consciousness might be useful for us to find a more unified framework for neuroscience, the philosophy of mind, and the studies of artificial intelligence. At least, it helps us to avoid making more useless efforts."

Currently, the chronic mTBI literature conveys conflicting findings, likely in large part due to the use of measures that lack sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive changes and failures to consider individual differences in cognitive outcomes post mTBI. In addition, while it is well documented that a significant number of injuries go unreported, studies investigating individuals with a history of mTBI that capture these unreported injuries are lacking in comparison to those using hospital-based samples. In this preregistered study, we used a range of complex behavioural tasks to investigate cognitive performance in a large sample of individuals with self-reported history of mTBI (n=82) and a control group (n=88). We also explored whether individual differences in injury-related factors predict cognitive performance in the mTBI group. The findings revealed poorer verbal working memory performance in mTBI participants compared to controls. No group differences were observed on tasks assessing visual working memory, multitasking ability, cognitive flexibility, attentional control, visuospatial ability, or information processing speed. Furthermore, the individual differences analyses suggest that age at injury may be an important predictor of working memory performance in both verbal and visual domains following mTBI. Together, these findings indicate that mTBI may have lasting impacts on verbal working memory capacity and that injury-related factors, such as age when the injury occurred, may be crucial to consider when assessing cognitive outcome in individuals with a history of mTBI."

Methods: Parents/caregivers of children ages 0-5 completed an anonymous survey via the crowdsourcing platform, AskingCanadians. The survey asked participants about their preferences in e-health services for supporting their children.  Results: Out of 606 surveyed parents/caregivers, 26.4% had a child diagnosed with a NDD or MI, self-reported by the parents/caregivers. There were many differences in preferences for e-health services between parents of children with one NDD/MI diagnosis, multiple NDDs/MIs, and no diagnoses. Parents of children with multiple NDDs/MIs preferred a mix of peer- and expert-driven programs and more structured and asynchronous program formats compared to the other groups, who preferred simply expert-driven programs. Conclusions: Tailoring e-health programs based on parents of children with NDDs’/MIs’ preferences could enhance e-health program effectiveness, reduce dropout rates, and improve program development."

In each of the seven countries (United States, Egypt, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, France and India) the positive effects of social support and social connection were generally stronger predictors of relationship satisfaction than the negative effects of loneliness. Additionally, these relationships remained regardless of gender, age, or education status. Overall, our results suggest that social support, social connection, and loneliness are independently important predictors of relationship satisfaction and that the positive aspects of people’s social lives (e.g., social connection, social support) are generally more important than the negative ones (e.g., loneliness). Moreover, the results suggest the importance of the positive aspects of individuals' social lives are not simply limited to Western samples, but instead extend across cultural and national boundaries."

In a recently discovered visual illusion (the “Frame Effect”), it has been shown that flashing a stimulus inside of a moving frame produces a large misperception of that stimulus’s position.

That is, one stimulus is presented but two are perceived. In both experiments, a single red dot was flashed when the moving frames reversed direction, and participants were asked to report how many dots they saw.

In each of the seven countries (United States, Egypt, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, France and India) the positive effects of social support and social connection were generally stronger predictors of relationship satisfaction than the negative effects of loneliness. Additionally, these relationships remained regardless of gender, age, or education status. Overall, our results suggest that social support, social connection, and loneliness are independently important predictors of relationship satisfaction and that the positive aspects of people’s social lives (e.g., social connection, social support) are generally more important than the negative ones (e.g., loneliness). Moreover, the results suggest the importance of the positive aspects of individuals' social lives are not simply limited to Western samples, but instead extend across cultural and national boundaries."

Cameron, Ryan Jeffrey Giuliano, Leslie E Roos","Background: This study aimed to describe preferences for e-health services among parents/caregivers of young children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and/or mental illnesses (MI). Methods: Parents/caregivers of children ages 0-5 completed an anonymous survey via the crowdsourcing platform, AskingCanadians. The survey asked participants about their preferences in e-health services for supporting their children.  Results: Out of 606 surveyed parents/caregivers, 26.4% had a child diagnosed with a NDD or MI, self-reported by the parents/caregivers. There were many differences in preferences for e-health services between parents of children with one NDD/MI diagnosis, multiple NDDs/MIs, and no diagnoses. Parents of children with multiple NDDs/MIs preferred a mix of peer- and expert-driven programs and more structured and asynchronous program formats compared to the other groups, who preferred simply expert-driven programs. Conclusions: Tailoring e-health programs based on parents of children with NDDs’/MIs’ preferences could enhance e-health program effectiveness, reduce dropout rates, and improve program development."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/skdcp,2024-02-23,Triple definition or explanation of consciousness,Xinyan Zhang,"The author argues in this paper that consciousness may never be defined or explained with entities and properties, neither with brains and neurons, nor with particles, waves, and fields.   Instead, a system is proposed in this paper, with matter, energy and lives as its components, and with all its components defined as changes. The definitions or explanations of consciousness based on the systematic relationships among these components are: •	Ontologically, consciousness is universal, since it may only be the systematic distinction between matter and energy.   •	Epistemologically, consciousness is unique, since it may only be the energy qualified systematically by the matter. •	Semantically, consciousness is neither the cause nor the effect of mental activities, since it may only be languages.    To deny its ontology means to be a dualist. To deny its epistemology means to be a Platonist. And to deny its semantics means to be an animist or panpsychist. None of them may contribute anything to neuroscience or artificial intelligence.   Compared with matter and energy, life is the more difficult part of this definition and explanation, also an indispensable part since life is the only cause or effect of matter and energy. If without life, matter and energy by themselves cannot be the explanation of agency or intentional action, nor the explanation of learning and knowledge. Moreover, a system only with matter and energy as its components is fundamentally against birth, death, development, and evolution. Neither of them may explain why everything including us and our cosmos must be created but nothing may remain forever. And the only reason why there is consciousness is that it may be the birth or death of lives.   Such defined or explained consciousness might be useful for us to find a more unified framework for neuroscience, the philosophy of mind, and the studies of artificial intelligence. At least, it helps us to avoid making more useless efforts."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8zub6,2024-02-23,Decreased working memory capacity in the chronic phase of mild traumatic brain injury,"N/A, Hannah Filmer, Paul Dux","Despite increasing recognition of the significance of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), our knowledge of the long-term cognitive impacts of the injury remains incomplete. Currently, the chronic mTBI literature conveys conflicting findings, likely in large part due to the use of measures that lack sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive changes and failures to consider individual differences in cognitive outcomes post mTBI. In addition, while it is well documented that a significant number of injuries go unreported, studies investigating individuals with a history of mTBI that capture these unreported injuries are lacking in comparison to those using hospital-based samples. In this preregistered study, we used a range of complex behavioural tasks to investigate cognitive performance in a large sample of individuals with self-reported history of mTBI (n=82) and a control group (n=88). We also explored whether individual differences in injury-related factors predict cognitive performance in the mTBI group. The findings revealed poorer verbal working memory performance in mTBI participants compared to controls. No group differences were observed on tasks assessing visual working memory, multitasking ability, cognitive flexibility, attentional control, visuospatial ability, or information processing speed. Furthermore, the individual differences analyses suggest that age at injury may be an important predictor of working memory performance in both verbal and visual domains following mTBI. Together, these findings indicate that mTBI may have lasting impacts on verbal working memory capacity and that injury-related factors, such as age when the injury occurred, may be crucial to consider when assessing cognitive outcome in individuals with a history of mTBI."

Moreover, using the terms “white” and “European (American)” interchangeably implies that only people racialized as white can be European, masking the history and current reality of millions of Europeans of Color. Labels that limit being European to those racialized as white perpetuate othering and uphold a hierarchy where being white is the only acceptable embodiment of being European. With racism on the rise in Europe, it is important for researchers to recognize the power in the language we use. We suggest that APA and scholars following APA style consider the implications of these terms and not use them interchangeably, as doing so reinforces inequity across the globe."

This allowed us to control for measurement- and occasion-specific biases, as well as random error. We assessed how the two types of envy relate to age, sex, education, and income (both personal and household). Additionally, we conducted linear regressions on self-reports (Estonian, N = 62,545; Russian, N = 3025; English, N = 640), controlling for the Big Five and demographic variables. Big Five domains’ rtrues with benign (-.65 to .21; -.69 to .37; -.76 to .08) and malicious envy (-.40 to .26; -.47 to .30; -.49 to .14) replicated across the Estonian-, Russian-, and English-speaking samples, respectively. Across the three samples, we found benign and malicious envy to be negatively associated with age (in years) and sex (female). In the Estonian-speaking sample, those with higher levels of benign and malicious envy tended to report higher personal and household incomes. Our findings show that envy is not redundant with the Big Five personality domains. We also highlight the importance of incorporating and collecting data from multiple raters in personality studies, especially for socially transgressive traits."

Moreover, using the terms “white” and “European (American)” interchangeably implies that only people racialized as white can be European, masking the history and current reality of millions of Europeans of Color. Labels that limit being European to those racialized as white perpetuate othering and uphold a hierarchy where being white is the only acceptable embodiment of being European. With racism on the rise in Europe, it is important for researchers to recognize the power in the language we use. We suggest that APA and scholars following APA style consider the implications of these terms and not use them interchangeably, as doing so reinforces inequity across the globe."

In the current study, we combined self- and informant-reports to estimate personality domains’ (Big Five, Dark Dyad) ‘true’ correlations (rtrues) with benign and malicious envy using three samples tested in different languages (Estonian, N = 20,925; Russian, N = 767; English, N = 593). This allowed us to control for measurement- and occasion-specific biases, as well as random error. We assessed how the two types of envy relate to age, sex, education, and income (both personal and household). Additionally, we conducted linear regressions on self-reports (Estonian, N = 62,545; Russian, N = 3025; English, N = 640), controlling for the Big Five and demographic variables. Big Five domains’ rtrues with benign (-.65 to .21; -.69 to .37; -.76 to .08) and malicious envy (-.40 to .26; -.47 to .30; -.49 to .14) replicated across the Estonian-, Russian-, and English-speaking samples, respectively. Across the three samples, we found benign and malicious envy to be negatively associated with age (in years) and sex (female). In the Estonian-speaking sample, those with higher levels of benign and malicious envy tended to report higher personal and household incomes. Our findings show that envy is not redundant with the Big Five personality domains. We also highlight the importance of incorporating and collecting data from multiple raters in personality studies, especially for socially transgressive traits."

Maternal mental health problems increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic with many parents not having access to evidence-based treatments. Mobile health (mHealth) treatments show promise for adult mood and anxiety disorders but rarely include parenting strategies and have high dropout rates.   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program, which responds to maternal mental health and parenting needs while building social connection between participants.   Design: A two-arm, phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the BEAM intervention compared to unrestricted services-as-usual (US). Participants completed self-report measures at eligibility screening (baseline assessment, T0), prior to randomization (pre-intervention, T1) and immediately following the intervention (post-intervention, T2).   Setting: Individuals were recruited and completed surveys online.   Participants: A final sample of 119 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who self-reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.  Intervention: Individuals randomized to treatment participated in the 10-week BEAM program. It was hypothesized that the treatment group would report decreases in mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, anger, alcohol use, sleep problems) and harsh parenting (overreactive parenting, conflictual parent-child interactions) compared to the US group.     Results: BEAM out-performed the US condition in reducing anxiety symptoms. Participants in both groups experienced significant decreases in depression. Participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms at screening, experienced significant decreases in mental health symptoms and harsh parenting composite scores, if they received the BEAM program, compared to US. This included specific declines in anxiety, anger, and dysfunctional parenting interactions. There were no significant effects for sleep problems, alcohol misuse, or overactive discipline.    Conclusion and Relevance: BEAM is a highly scalable intervention that has the potential to rapidly reach underserved groups in need of mental health and parenting support. Next steps include improving the user interface and exploring engagement and implementation of the program within existing health and social service systems for long-term improvements in family health and well-being."

This review focuses on the family’s role in nurturing these skills in children and adolescents. On the basis of a comprehensive review of 40 relevant studies, we explored a wide range of family factors and their associations with developing critical reading skills. These factors were categorized into eleven categories: 1) socio-economic status (SES), 2) availability and access to resources, 3) teaching literacy, 4) literacy activities composites, 5) shared reading, 6) parental habits, attitudes, and values–beliefs, 7) parental school involvement, 8) language or ethnicity, 9) parental deficits, 10) family composition, and 11) parenting/family atmosphere. The most frequently assessed factors were SES, availability and access to resources, and literacy activities composites. Significantly, the availability of and access to resources and shared reading practices categories demonstrated a systematic positive association with critical reading skills. In addition, children and adolescents whose home language matched the assessment language tended to perform better in critical reading, thus underscoring the significance of language background. High parental SES was also often associated with better critical reading skills. The results relating to the impact of parental reading difficulties were mixed. This review highlights the multifaceted potential of family environment to affect children’s critical reading skills.

We found that conflict resolution skills cluster with decision-making abilities, intelligence, social alliances, and expertise, while attributes such as being respected and liked constitute another distinct cluster. Conversely, traits like aggressiveness, being feared, and farming productivity align within a third separate cluster. After accounting for inter-rater variation, sound decision-making and intelligence (i.e., neural capital) as well as social alliances were positive predictors of conflict resolution skills, while aggressiveness was a negative predictor. Our results also reveal an overlap in similarity networks between women and men. These findings suggest that, when it comes to effective conflict resolution, it is neither better to be feared nor loved. Instead, in this egalitarian social context, well-connected individuals equipped with high levels of neural capital emerge as the most effective conflict mediators. Our results shed light on leadership phenotypes associated with conflict resolution under egalitarianism. Additionally, they carry implications for the evolution of group living among humans by highlighting the pivotal role of neural capital in promoting effective conflict mediation in more close-knit social contexts."

However, such treatment approaches are not widely accessible due to legal, medical, and financial limitations. In this study, we explore the potential of circular breathwork to serve as a non-pharmacological and hence more easily accessible alternative to engage similar therapeutic processes. Scientific studies investigating the effects of breathwork on mental health are only just emerging and the underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to address these questions by for the first time tracking physiological and experiential dynamics throughout the time course of a breathwork session, comparing two popular forms of breathwork: Holotropic Breathwork® and Consciously-Connected breathwork. We show that a reduction in end-tidal CO2 pressure due to deliberate hyperventilation is instrumental in catalyzing ASCs during breathwork. The ASCs evoked by breathwork were comparable to those produced by psychedelics, and their depth predicted psychological and physiological follow-on effects, including improved well-being and a reduction of depressive symptoms. Further analysis showed that different breathwork traditions impacted physiological markers as well as experiential and psychological outcomes in a similar way. Our findings identify physiological boundary conditions in which ASCs can arise in a non-pharmacological context, offering insights into the functional mechanisms of breathwork as well as its potential as a psychotherapeutic tool."

The newborns had reliable ERPs to native vowels from conception age 36 weeks and 1 day (36+1). The ERPs reflected spectral distinctions between vowel onsets from conception age 36+6 and durational distinctions at vowel offsets from conception age 37+6. Starting at age 40+1, there was evidence of neural discrimination of native vowel length contrast, indexed by a reliably negative MMR response. The present findings extend our understanding of the earliest stages of speech perception development in that they pinpoint the ages at which the cortex reliably responds to the phonetic characteristics of individual speech sounds and discriminates a native phoneme contrast. Curiously, the age at which the brain reliably differentiates vowel onsets coincides with what is considered term age in many countries (37+0 GA). Future studies should investigate to what extent the perinatal maturation of the cortical responses to speech sounds is modulated by the ambient language."

This review focuses on the family’s role in nurturing these skills in children and adolescents. On the basis of a comprehensive review of 40 relevant studies, we explored a wide range of family factors and their associations with developing critical reading skills. These factors were categorized into eleven categories: 1) socio-economic status (SES), 2) availability and access to resources, 3) teaching literacy, 4) literacy activities composites, 5) shared reading, 6) parental habits, attitudes, and values–beliefs, 7) parental school involvement, 8) language or ethnicity, 9) parental deficits, 10) family composition, and 11) parenting/family atmosphere. The most frequently assessed factors were SES, availability and access to resources, and literacy activities composites. Significantly, the availability of and access to resources and shared reading practices categories demonstrated a systematic positive association with critical reading skills. In addition, children and adolescents whose home language matched the assessment language tended to perform better in critical reading, thus underscoring the significance of language background. High parental SES was also often associated with better critical reading skills. The results relating to the impact of parental reading difficulties were mixed. This review highlights the multifaceted potential of family environment to affect children’s critical reading skills. However, the variability almost from study to study in the assessment of family factors and critical reading point to the need for further research in this emerging field."

Simpson, Charlie Rioux, Kristin Reynolds, Ryan Jeffrey Giuliano, Jennifer Harrington, Jennifer Protudjer, Melanie Soderstrom","Importance: Exposure to maternal mental illness in the first 3 years of life is associated with poor child outcomes. Maternal mental health problems increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic with many parents not having access to evidence-based treatments. Mobile health (mHealth) treatments show promise for adult mood and anxiety disorders but rarely include parenting strategies and have high dropout rates.   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program, which responds to maternal mental health and parenting needs while building social connection between participants.   Design: A two-arm, phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the BEAM intervention compared to unrestricted services-as-usual (US). Participants completed self-report measures at eligibility screening (baseline assessment, T0), prior to randomization (pre-intervention, T1) and immediately following the intervention (post-intervention, T2).   Setting: Individuals were recruited and completed surveys online.   Participants: A final sample of 119 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who self-reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.  Intervention: Individuals randomized to treatment participated in the 10-week BEAM program. It was hypothesized that the treatment group would report decreases in mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, anger, alcohol use, sleep problems) and harsh parenting (overreactive parenting, conflictual parent-child interactions) compared to the US group.     Results: BEAM out-performed the US condition in reducing anxiety symptoms. Participants in both groups experienced significant decreases in depression. Participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms at screening, experienced significant decreases in mental health symptoms and harsh parenting composite scores, if they received the BEAM program, compared to US. This included specific declines in anxiety, anger, and dysfunctional parenting interactions. There were no significant effects for sleep problems, alcohol misuse, or overactive discipline.    Conclusion and Relevance: BEAM is a highly scalable intervention that has the potential to rapidly reach underserved groups in need of mental health and parenting support. Next steps include improving the user interface and exploring engagement and implementation of the program within existing health and social service systems for long-term improvements in family health and well-being."

We interviewed 18 children aged 6-13 years and held three focus groups with 15 parents and caregivers across three sites (two metropolitan, one regional).

We identified four overarching themes: (1) Learning to Navigate Risk; (2) Risky Kids is Different; (3) Coaches Facilitating Growth and Change, and (4) Stronger Minds and Bodies. Findings suggest that a facilitated risky play program can offer a supportive, safe space for children to develop confidence and resilience, and may particularly benefit children who prefer non-competitive group activities that nurture individual strengths and accommodates all abilities. Families reported that the program offered valuable opportunities to enhance children’s mental wellbeing, including social, emotional, and behavioural regulation.

The results showed a significant spatialization effect for all sequence lengths except for sequences of 5 items. In Experiment 2, 96 participants performed the same spatialization task for sequences of three, four, and five items but using a within-subject design. The results confirmed the absence of a SPoARC effect for sequences of five items, and showed a greater effect for sequences of four items. In addition, we found that participants with lower spans spatialized more sequences of four items. This indicates that the effect is linked to participants' span. Overall, our findings suggest that working memory load is a moderator of the spatialization effect."

We aimed to examine associations between media use and paranoia at the within- and between-person levels. Participants were 409 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder. Measures included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, followed by ecological momentary assessments (EMA) collected three times daily over 30 days. EMA evaluated paranoia and five types of media use: TV, social media, music, reading or writing, and other internet or computer use. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine paranoia as a function of each type of media use and vice-versa. Characteristics associated with lower likelihood of media use included minority ethnoracial status, lower educational attainment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder. There were within-person associations between social media use and subsequently reduced paranoia in the schizophrenia group: fold-change=0.900; 95% CI: 0.840, 0.965; and between listening to music and subsequently decreased paranoia in the bipolar disorder group: fold-change=0.949; 95% CI: 0.906, 0.995. Associations of other media with paranoia were not significant. The associations of social media use and listening to music with reductions in paranoia may reflect clinical benefits of social interaction and distraction. However, systemic inequities and individual factors may hamper the accessibility of certain types of media."

When we speak, the sensory consequences of the fundamental frequency (f0) of our own voice, generated by vocal fold vibrations, are suppressed. However, due to bone/air conduction filtering effects, the f0 we self-generate is measurably different from the f0 we subjectively perceive as defining our own voice. Using an auditory change deafness paradigm, we parametrically tested the sensitivity to auditory change in the frequency neighbourhoods of individual objective and subjective voice f0, and found that participants experience change deafness for both to a similar extent, relative to a control pitch condition. We conclude that when we listen attentively, we are likely to filter out voice pitches in the vicinity of our own objective and subjective voice f0, possibly as a long-term consequence of speaking-induced suppression mechanisms integrated with individual, perceptual bodily priors."

Evidence indicates that these behavioral modes entail detection of the relative direction of movement that is used as perceptual information to control and coordinate performance. At higher frequencies, this yields instability of 180° and spontaneous transition to 0°. The ability to perform a 90° coordination can be acquired by learning to detect and use relative position as information. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (2021) found that skilled performance of 90° bimanual coordination exhibits mode switching to 0° or 180° with frequency scaling. Unlike the switching from 180° to 0°, transition from a learned coordination to 0° or 180° entails a change in information. They found that neither this switching nor performance of corrections to resist switching entailed intentional decisions during performance. Relatedly, they found that correction is not intrinsic to skilled performance of 90°. They successfully simulated results of frequency scaling of 90° using an extended Bingham model in which switching and correction were initiated as the information for 90° fell below threshold. We now attempt to replicate these findings testing unimanual 90° coordination with noninterference and correcting instructions. With correcting in the previous study, bimanual 90° coordination remained stable at all frequencies while noninterference instructions yielded mode switching at higher frequencies. Snapp-Childs, Wilson and Bingham (2011) showed that unimanual coordination switches at much lower frequencies than bimanual coordination. It is significantly less stable due to coupling that is unidirectional. The current finding was that unimanual performance of 90° fails to remain stable even with correcting at higher frequencies. Results were simulated using a unimanual version of the extended Bingham model."

Using mixed-methods consisting of qualitative interviews (N = 24) and quantitative surveys (N = 564), we found that White people exhibited different combinations of prideful (“I am a proud person of our ethnic heritage”), dissociated (“My ethnic group does not have a significant impact on how I see the world”), and power-cognizant (“I am a White person with privileges because of my ethnic group”) identity strategies. Moreover, these White identity strategies were associated with linking colonialism and racial inequalities and, thereby, with ideologies legitimizing them.

When we speak, the sensory consequences of the fundamental frequency (f0) of our own voice, generated by vocal fold vibrations, are suppressed. However, due to bone/air conduction filtering effects, the f0 we self-generate is measurably different from the f0 we subjectively perceive as defining our own voice. Using an auditory change deafness paradigm, we parametrically tested the sensitivity to auditory change in the frequency neighbourhoods of individual objective and subjective voice f0, and found that participants experience change deafness for both to a similar extent, relative to a control pitch condition. We conclude that when we listen attentively, we are likely to filter out voice pitches in the vicinity of our own objective and subjective voice f0, possibly as a long-term consequence of speaking-induced suppression mechanisms integrated with individual, perceptual bodily priors."

Herth, Qin Zhu, Xiaoye Michael Wang, Geoffrey P Bingham","Two rhythmic coordinations, 0° and 180° relative phase, can be performed stably at preferred frequency (~1 Hz) without training. Evidence indicates that these behavioral modes entail detection of the relative direction of movement that is used as perceptual information to control and coordinate performance. At higher frequencies, this yields instability of 180° and spontaneous transition to 0°. The ability to perform a 90° coordination can be acquired by learning to detect and use relative position as information. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (2021) found that skilled performance of 90° bimanual coordination exhibits mode switching to 0° or 180° with frequency scaling. Unlike the switching from 180° to 0°, transition from a learned coordination to 0° or 180° entails a change in information. They found that neither this switching nor performance of corrections to resist switching entailed intentional decisions during performance. Relatedly, they found that correction is not intrinsic to skilled performance of 90°. They successfully simulated results of frequency scaling of 90° using an extended Bingham model in which switching and correction were initiated as the information for 90° fell below threshold. We now attempt to replicate these findings testing unimanual 90° coordination with noninterference and correcting instructions. With correcting in the previous study, bimanual 90° coordination remained stable at all frequencies while noninterference instructions yielded mode switching at higher frequencies. Snapp-Childs, Wilson and Bingham (2011) showed that unimanual coordination switches at much lower frequencies than bimanual coordination. It is significantly less stable due to coupling that is unidirectional. The current finding was that unimanual performance of 90° fails to remain stable even with correcting at higher frequencies. Results were simulated using a unimanual version of the extended Bingham model."

Depp, Raeanne C. Moore, Philip D. Harvey, Amy Pinkham","Paranoia is a spectrum of fear-related experiences that spans diagnostic categories and is influenced by the environment. The extent to which traditional and digital media use is associated with paranoia remains unknown. We aimed to examine associations between media use and paranoia at the within- and between-person levels. Participants were 409 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder. Measures included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, followed by ecological momentary assessments (EMA) collected three times daily over 30 days. EMA evaluated paranoia and five types of media use: TV, social media, music, reading or writing, and other internet or computer use. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine paranoia as a function of each type of media use and vice-versa. Characteristics associated with lower likelihood of media use included minority ethnoracial status, lower educational attainment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder. There were within-person associations between social media use and subsequently reduced paranoia in the schizophrenia group: fold-change=0.900; 95% CI: 0.840, 0.965; and between listening to music and subsequently decreased paranoia in the bipolar disorder group: fold-change=0.949; 95% CI: 0.906, 0.995. Associations of other media with paranoia were not significant. The associations of social media use and listening to music with reductions in paranoia may reflect clinical benefits of social interaction and distraction. However, systemic inequities and individual factors may hamper the accessibility of certain types of media."

In the present study, we investigated how spatialization can be modulated by the number of items to be maintained in working memory. In Experiment 1, 139 participants performed a spatialization task with sequences of either two, three, four, or five items using a between-subject design. The results showed a significant spatialization effect for all sequence lengths except for sequences of 5 items. In Experiment 2, 96 participants performed the same spatialization task for sequences of three, four, and five items but using a within-subject design. The results confirmed the absence of a SPoARC effect for sequences of five items, and showed a greater effect for sequences of four items. In addition, we found that participants with lower spans spatialized more sequences of four items. This indicates that the effect is linked to participants' span. Overall, our findings suggest that working memory load is a moderator of the spatialization effect."

We interviewed 18 children aged 6-13 years and held three focus groups with 15 parents and caregivers across three sites (two metropolitan, one regional). Guided by phenomenological design, template analysis was used to generate codes, categories, and themes. We identified four overarching themes: (1) Learning to Navigate Risk; (2) Risky Kids is Different; (3) Coaches Facilitating Growth and Change, and (4) Stronger Minds and Bodies. Findings suggest that a facilitated risky play program can offer a supportive, safe space for children to develop confidence and resilience, and may particularly benefit children who prefer non-competitive group activities that nurture individual strengths and accommodates all abilities. Families reported that the program offered valuable opportunities to enhance children’s mental wellbeing, including social, emotional, and behavioural regulation.

As virtual tourism emerges as a viable alternativein the wake of travel restrictions, ensuring the security and sustainability of virtual tourism platforms becomes paramount. Leveraging insights from the field of wireless cyber-physical systems (CPS), particularly advanced attack detection and data generationtechniques using self-training powered generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study proposes a novel approach to fortifying virtual tourism platforms against cyber threats. Drawing upon case studies and empirical data, we explore the application of self-trainingpowered GANs as a means to enhance security in virtual tourism platforms, consideringthe unique challenges posed by the dynamic landscape of post-pandemic tourism. Bysynthesizing realistic yet synthetic data through GANs, virtual tourismplatforms canbolster their defenses against a myriad of cyber attacks, safeguarding sensitive user information and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of implementing such security measures within the context of post-pandemic China, considering the country's burgeoning virtual tourism industry and its potential to shape global tourism trends. Our findings underscore the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures in fostering trust andconfidence among virtual tourists, thereby facilitating the sustainable growth of virtual tourism in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this interdisciplinary exploration, we aim to provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and cybersecurity professionals seeking to navigatethe evolving landscape of virtual tourism while mitigating associated security risks. Ultimately, by embracing innovative approaches to cybersecurity, virtual tourismplatforms can not only thrive in the post-pandemic era but also contribute tothebroader goal of building resilient and secure digital ecosystems."

Results showed that quality of social interactions during the day was associated with evening- but not morning self-esteem.

We present recent studies comparing different types of bilinguals (simultaneous and sequential) and explaining their differential levels of ultimate attainment in different learning scenarios. We also show that although the model has the word “perception” in its name, it was designed to also explain phonological development in general, including lexical development, speech production, and orthographic effects. The studies reviewed in the chapter include new methods for examining lexical development and speech production, via implicit word learning and corpus-based analyses respectively, as well as a novel suprasegmental example of the L2LP SUBSET problem, which was conceptualized as the reverse of the commonly NEW scenario where L2 learners are phased with target contrasts that do not exist in their L1. We also review a recent study on the effect of bidialectalism on L2 acquisition, showing that the L2LP model’s explanations not only apply to speakers of multiple languages but also of multiple dialects. Finally, we present other topics and future directions, including phonetic training, going beyond segmental phonology, and the formalisation of orthographic effects in phonological development. All in all, the chapter demonstrates that the L2LP model can be regarded as a comprehensive theoretical, computational, and probabilistic model or framework for explaining how we learn the phonetics and phonology of multiple languages (sequentially or simultaneously) with variable levels of language input throughout the life span."

We present recent studies comparing different types of bilinguals (simultaneous and sequential) and explaining their differential levels of ultimate attainment in different learning scenarios. We also show that although the model has the word “perception” in its name, it was designed to also explain phonological development in general, including lexical development, speech production, and orthographic effects. The studies reviewed in the chapter include new methods for examining lexical development and speech production, via implicit word learning and corpus-based analyses respectively, as well as a novel suprasegmental example of the L2LP SUBSET problem, which was conceptualized as the reverse of the commonly NEW scenario where L2 learners are phased with target contrasts that do not exist in their L1. We also review a recent study on the effect of bidialectalism on L2 acquisition, showing that the L2LP model’s explanations not only apply to speakers of multiple languages but also of multiple dialects. Finally, we present other topics and future directions, including phonetic training, going beyond segmental phonology, and the formalisation of orthographic effects in phonological development. All in all, the chapter demonstrates that the L2LP model can be regarded as a comprehensive theoretical, computational, and probabilistic model or framework for explaining how we learn the phonetics and phonology of multiple languages (sequentially or simultaneously) with variable levels of language input throughout the life span."

Reitz","Theory and empirical evidence suggest that self-esteem and the quality of social relationships are mutually related across long time spans, however, relatively less is known about this association in daily life. Experience sampling data of 232 Dutch Master’s students (Mage = 24.6, SDage = 2.7) was collected across 4 measurement waves including 14 days with 4 daily assessments in each wave. Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling was applied to study the within-day associations between morning/evening self-esteem and social interactions. First, we linked morning and evening self-esteem to the aggregated quality of social interactions during the day. Results showed that quality of social interactions during the day was associated with evening- but not morning self-esteem. Second, we linked anticipation of social interactions to morning and evening self-esteem. Positive anticipation of social interactions was positively associated with morning- but not evening self-esteem. Third, we investigated whether trait self-esteem moderated the within-day associations, but found no support for this hypothesis. Our results provide a better understanding of the daily short-term dynamics of self-esteem and social interactions in daily life – as they suggest that not only our actual social experiences, but also our anticipation of social interactions matter for daily self-esteem dynamics."

As virtual tourism emerges as a viable alternativein the wake of travel restrictions, ensuring the security and sustainability of virtual tourism platforms becomes paramount. Leveraging insights from the field of wireless cyber-physical systems (CPS), particularly advanced attack detection and data generationtechniques using self-training powered generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study proposes a novel approach to fortifying virtual tourism platforms against cyber threats. Drawing upon case studies and empirical data, we explore the application of self-trainingpowered GANs as a means to enhance security in virtual tourism platforms, consideringthe unique challenges posed by the dynamic landscape of post-pandemic tourism. Bysynthesizing realistic yet synthetic data through GANs, virtual tourismplatforms canbolster their defenses against a myriad of cyber attacks, safeguarding sensitive user information and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of implementing such security measures within the context of post-pandemic China, considering the country's burgeoning virtual tourism industry and its potential to shape global tourism trends. Our findings underscore the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures in fostering trust andconfidence among virtual tourists, thereby facilitating the sustainable growth of virtual tourism in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this interdisciplinary exploration, we aim to provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and cybersecurity professionals seeking to navigatethe evolving landscape of virtual tourism while mitigating associated security risks. Ultimately, by embracing innovative approaches to cybersecurity, virtual tourismplatforms can not only thrive in the post-pandemic era but also contribute tothebroader goal of building resilient and secure digital ecosystems."
