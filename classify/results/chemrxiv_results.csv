Green,"chemical reactions in subcritical or near-critical solvents hold significant promise for numerous industrial and environmental applications. the arrhenius equation is typically used to describe the temperature dependence of reaction rates, yet it often falls short in capturing the behavior of liquid phase reaction rates near critical points of solvents. to address this limitation, we propose a novel functional form that can correctly describe the temperature trends of liquid phase rate constants from room temperature up to the critical temperature of a solvent. the proposed scheme uses four kinetic parameters with physical implications, two accounting for the gas phase contribution and the other two accounting for the solvation effect on reactions. the new functional form can accurately reproduce the anomalous temperature dependence of liquid phase rate constants in subcritical and near-critical regimes that the arrhenius equation fails to capture. furthermore, our preliminary finding suggests that the kinetic parameters associated with the solvation terms can be computed with ab initio approaches to estimate the temperature-dependent rate constants of liquid phase reactions based on their corresponding rate constants in gas phase. the proposed functional form provides an alternative approach to describe the non-arrhenius behavior of diverse liquid phase reactions across a wide range of temperature."

Lewis,"organohalogen compounds are extensively used as building blocks, intermediates, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals due to their unique chemical and biological properties. installing halogen substituents, however, frequently requires functionalized starting materials and multistep functional group interconversion. several classes of halogenases evolved in nature to enable halogenation of a different classes of substrates; for example, site-selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic compounds is catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases (fdhs). mechanistic studies have shown that these enzymes use fadh2 supplied by a flavin reductase (fred) to reduce o2 to water with concomitant oxidation of x- to hox (x = cl, br, i). this species travels through a tunnel within the enzyme to access the fdh active site. here, it is believed to h-bond to an active site lysine proximal to bound substrate, enabling electrophilic halogenation with selectivity imparted via molecular recognition, rather than directing groups or strong electronic activation.  the unique selectivity of fdhs led to several early biocatalysis efforts, preparative halogenation was rare, and the hallmark catalyst-controlled selectivity of fdhs did not translate to non-native substrates. fdh engineering was limited to site-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in modest changes in site-selectivity or substrate preference. to address these limitations, we optimized expression conditions for the fdh rebh and its cognate fred, rebf. we then showed that rebh could be used for preparative halogenation of non-native substrates with catalyst-controlled selectivity. we reported the first examples in which the stability, substrate scope, and site selectivity of an fdh were improved to synthetically useful levels via directed evolution. x-ray crystal structures of evolved fdhs and reversion mutations showed that random mutations throughout the rebh structure were critical to achieving high levels of activity and selectivity on diverse aromatic substrates, and these data were used in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to develop predictive model for fdh selectivity. finally, we used family-wide genome mining to identify a diverse set of fdhs with novel substrate scope and complementary regioselectivity on large, three-dimensionally complex compounds.  the diversity of our evolved and mined fdhs allowed us to pursue synthetic applications beyond simple aromatic halogenation. for example, we established that fdhs catalyze enantioselective reactions involving desymmetrization, atroposelective halogenation, and halocyclization. these results highlight the ability of fdh active sites to tolerate different substrate topologies. this utility was further expanded by our recent studies on the single component fdh/fred, aetf. while we were initially drawn to aetf because it does not require a separate fred, we found that it halogenates substrates that are not halogenated efficiently or at all by other fdhs and provides high enantioselectivity for reactions that could only be achieved using rebh variants after extensive mutagenesis. perhaps most notably, aetf catalyzes site-selective aromatic iodination and enantioselective iodoetherification. together, these studies highlight the origins of fdh engineering, the utility and limitations of the enzymes developed to date, and the promise of fdhs for an ever-expanding range of biocatalytic halogenation reactions."

Arges,"reducing the cost of hydrogen transport is an important priority for proliferation of clean hydrogen to decarbonize various sectors of industry and heavy-duty vehicle transportation. pipeline transport of gases is the lowest cost delivery method for gases over long distances, but there are only a few pipeline networks dedicated to hydrogen. it is possible to alleviate clean hydrogen transportation costs by delivering it via existing natural gas pipeline infrastructures. this strategy, however, necessitates dilution of hydrogen by blending it with natural gas as the hydrogen can embrittle existing pipeline materials. an electrochemical hydrogen pump (ehp) is a separation platform capable of de-blending hydrogen from natural gas mixtures at end use locations because many applications require purified hydrogen. in this work, we deploy high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (ht-pem) ehps to purify hydrogen from dilute hydrogen-natural gas mixtures (i.e., 5 to 20 vol% hydrogen). the ht-pem ehp uses an ion-pair ht-pem with perfluorosulfonic acid-phosphonic acid ionomer blends as electrode binders. interestingly, we observe that activation overpotentials govern ht-pem ehp polarization when feeding dilute hydrogen mixtures. we ascribe this observation to interfacial mass transfer resistance of hydrogen through the ionomer binder to the electrocatalyst surface resulting in a lower surface concentration of hydrogen and a lower exchange current density. pressurizing the anode to 1.76 barabs ameliorates the interfacial mass transfer resistance and enabled us to achieve an ehp limiting current of 1.4 a cm-2 with a 10 vol% of hydrogen in natural gas feed. this configuration also pressurized the hydrogen at the cathode to 2.51 barabs. the ht-pem ehp showed a small degradation rate, 44 µv h-1, during a 100-hour durability test purifying 10 vol% hydrogen-natural gas feed mixtures to 99.3 vol% hydrogen."

Patzke,"metal-based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. in this work, we employed operando x-ray absorption (xas) and in situ raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure-activity relationships of low-crystalline cobalt sulfide (l-cos) catalysts toward overall water splitting. the operando results for l-cos catalyzing alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (her) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in s-co-co-s moieties as the true catalytic active species. in comparison, during the acidic her, l-cos undergoes reversible redox changes of co centers, and h2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the co-s-co configurations. further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high-valent co4+ species in l-cos for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (oer), and generation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline co3o4 and co-ldh references. these insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation under different media, and demonstrate how their restructurings exert influence on the catalytic activity."

Realff,"the question has shifted from whether solid sorbents can work in direct air capture (dac) technologies to which solid sorbents are more economically advantaged. determining this is challenging due to the influence of many different yet interconnected sorbent properties on the cost of co2 capture. existing dac economic models oversimplify sorbent stability by treating it as a simple replacement rate, neglecting crucial factors such as capacity loss rate and form. to address this challenge, we have developed an economic model that accounts for sorbent degradation in dac processes. by factoring in capacity loss over time, our model provides a more accurate estimate of the cost associated with dac and highlights the optimum time for sorbent replacement. we then identified sorbent characteristics and process features that minimize both the carbon footprint and the cost of captured co2. to further investigate the interplay of sorbent properties and dac cost, we constructed a series of alkyl- and epoxy-functionalized polyamine sorbents. the sorbents’ co2 uptake, heat of adsorption and capacity fade were adjusted via a one-step modification, varying the proportions of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. we then integrated the experimentally-measured parameters, including the form of degradation, into our economic model to probe which combination of sorbent properties results in the lowest cost of dac for a fixed operating condition. the results provide guidelines and priorities for sorbent performance metrics that will yield the most cost-effective dac technologies."

Martin Bollinger Jr.,"hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (h6h) is an fe(ii)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (fe/2og) oxygenase that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of scopolamine, a prolifically administered anti-nausea drug. after its namesake first reaction, h6h couples the newly installed c6-bonded oxygen to c7 to form the epoxide of scopolamine. oxoiron(iv) (ferryl) intermediates initiate both reactions by cleaving c–h bonds, but it remains unclear how the enzyme switches target site and promotes (c6)o–c7 coupling in preference to c7 hydroxylation in the second step. in one possible epoxidation mechanism, the c6 oxygen would – analogously to mechanisms proposed for the fe/2og halogenases and, in a parallel study, n-acetylnorloline synthase (lolo) – coordinate as alkoxide to the c7–h-cleaving ferryl intermediate to enable alkoxyl coupling to the ensuing c7 radical. here we provide structural and kinetic evidence that h6h instead exploits the distinct spatial dependencies of competitive c–h-cleavage (c6 vs c7) and c–o-coupling (oxygen rebound vs cyclization) steps to promote the two-step sequence without substrate coordination or repositioning for the epoxidation step. structural comparisons of ferryl-mimicking vanadyl complexes of wild-type h6h and a variant that preferentially 7-hydroxylates instead of epoxidizing 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine suggest that only a modest (~ 10°) shift in the fe–o–h(c7) approach angle is sufficient to change the outcome. the observation that, in wild-type h6h, ²h₂o solvent also increases the c7-hydroxylation:epoxidation ratio by ~ 8-fold implies that the latter outcome requires cleavage of the alcohol o-h bond, which, unlike in the lolo oxacyclization, is not accomplished in advance of c–h cleavage."

Baumer Keegan Pietrak Stefan Bernhard,"the generation of hydrogen from abundant and renewable precursors driven by sunlight will be a cornerstone of a future, sustainable hydrogen infrastructure.  current methods to monitor the evolution of hydrogen in such photocatalytic systems such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, manometry or raman spectroscopy are either expensive and low throughput or lack sensitivity and selectivity over other gasses. this impediment hinders the generation of photo-driven hydrogen evolution data necessary for machine learning and artificial intelligence-based protocols. this work presents an open-source approach for studying solar-driven hydrogen evolution reactions (hers) in parallel that uses colorimetric hydrogen detection films in tandem with an image analysis software capable of providing metrics such as hydrogen amount, hydrogen evolution rates, incubation times, and plateau times, and more.  the sensing medium is composed of 0.05 % (w/w) pt impregnated molybdenum (vi) oxide or tungsten (vi) oxide which was incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) films placed under clear, gas impermeable septa. to conduct experiments, users require only blue reaction-driving high intensity leds, a camera, and uniform lighting to take pictures as the septa darken. this work introduces a sample configuration in which nine samples in hydrogen sensitive septa-capped vials were illuminated and the gas evolution is monitored using a raspberrypi for image capture and storage. two calibration methods are presented, one uses a gravimetric hydrogen evolution with zn/hcl that is compared to a direct hydrogen injection. both methods allow the accurate correlation of normalized intensity values of film photographs to mole fractions of h2 ranging from 0 to 50%. four light-driven hers are described that highlight the capabilities of the detection method, two of which were conducted using the novel septa-based instrumentation while the other two experiments used the films on a 108 multiwell plate using a previously discussed photoreactor.

Myers Shao-Yu Lu Sapana Shedge Arthur Pyuskulyan Katherine Donahoe Liang Shi Christine M. Isborn,"the dynamics of the nuclei of both chromophore and its condensed phase environment control many spectral features, including the vibronic and inhomogeneous broadening present in spectral lineshapes. for the cresyl violet chromophore in methanol, we here analyze and isolate the effect of specific chromophore-solvent interactions on simulated spectral densities, reorganization energies, and linear absorption spectra. employing both force field and ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories along with the inclusion of only certain solvent molecules in the excited state calculations, we determine that the methanol molecules axial to the chromophore are responsible for the majority of the inhomogeneous broadening, with a single methanol molecule that forms an axial hydrogen bond dominating the response. the strong peripheral hydrogen bonds do not contribute to spectral broadening, as they are very stable throughout the dynamics and do not lead to increased energy gap fluctuations. we also find that treating the strong peripheral hydrogen bonds as molecular mechanical point charges during the molecular dynamics simulation underestimates the vibronic coupling. including these peripheral hydrogen bonding methanol molecules in the quantum mechanical region in a geometry optimization increases the vibronic coupling, suggesting that a more advanced treatment of these strongly interacting solvent molecules during the molecular dynamics trajectory may be necessary to capture the full vibronic spectral broadening."

P. van Westen,"building reliable and robust quantitative structure-property relationship (qspr) models is a challenging task. first, the experimental data needs to be obtained, analyzed and curated. second, the number of available methods is continuously growing and evaluating different algorithms and methodologies can be arduous. finally, the last hurdle that researchers face is to ensure the reproducibility of their models and facilitate their transferability into practice. in this work, we introduce qsprpred, a toolkit for analysis of bioactivity data sets and qspr modelling, which attempts to address the aforementioned challenges. qsprpred's modular python api enables users to intuitively describe different parts of a modelling workflow using a plethora of pre-implemented components, but also integrate customized implementations in a ""plug-and-play"" manner. qsprpred data sets and models are directly serializable, which means they can be readily reproduced and put into operation after training as the models are saved with all required data pre-processing steps to make predictions on new compounds directly from smiles strings. the general-purpose character of qsprpred is also demonstrated by inclusion of support for multi-task and proteochemometric modelling. the package is extensively documented and comes with a large collection of tutorials to help new users. in this paper, we describe all of qsprpred's functionalities and also conduct a small benchmarking case study to illustrate how different components can be leveraged to compare a diverse set of models. qsprpred is fully open-source and available at https://github.com/cddleiden/qsprpred.  scientific contribution qsprpred aims to provide a complex, but comprehensive python api to conduct all tasks encountered in qspr modelling from data preparation and analysis to model creation and model deployment. in contrast to similar packages, qsprpred offers a wider and more exhaustive range of capabilities and integrations with many popular packages that also go beyond qspr modelling. a significant contribution of qsprpred is also in its automated and highly standardized serialization scheme, which significantly improves reproducibility and transferability of models."

Johnson," low-cost sensors (lcs) could help extend current air pollution monitoring programs by improving their density and time resolution. we evaluate rapid and hyperlocal pollution gradients in london using a network of lcs nodes and a mobile air pollution sensing (maps) car, focusing on no2. the measurements were strongly correlated; the r2-value decreased rapidly from 0.80 to 0.19 as the distance between the maps car and the lcs nodes increased from 0-5 m to 16-45 m. a maximum variability of 119.0 ppb/min or 181.6 ppb/100 m is seen in urban areas on the roads, with average variability of around 6 ppb/min. case studies in parks and tunnels revealed that no2 mixing ratios varied significantly over small distances and times. for example, the mean mixing ratio of no2 in the urban environment was 21.2 ppb (standard deviation (sd) = 11.8 ppb), whereas it increased to 61.3 ppb (sd = 25.0 ppb) in the rotherhithe tunnel, while no2 increased from a mean of 11.4 ppb (sd = 3.0 ppb) to 22.0 ppb (sd = 16.3 ppb), from the center of regent's park to the roads circling around it. this study shows that pollution changes rapidly in urban areas in both space and time, and that high-density networks and mobile monitoring can significantly increase the accuracy of pollution mapping."

Murakami Hiroyuki Matsuzaki,"perovskite solar cells (pscs) based on narrow-bandgap formamidinium lead halide (fapbi3) photoabsorber have garnered substantial attention owing to their high photovoltaic (pv) performances. extensive studies have established that the introduction of methylammonium chloride (macl) significantly improves the bulk quality of fapbi3 so commonly used; while heating the photoabsorber’s precursor film, the incorporated macl facilitates the crystalline growth of fapbi3, simultaneously volatilizing and dissipating from the perovskite layer. however, not only the photoabsorber's bulk quality but also heterointerfaces between the photoabsorber and carrier transport materials importantly contribute to the pv performances. paradoxically, the macl effects on fapbi3 heterointerfaces have been sparingly explored and consequently remained elusive. herein, the effects of macl on these heterointerfaces are unveiled by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity. the macl additive accelerates carrier injections from fapbi3 to the carrier transport materials presumably owing to the occurrence of spontaneous modulation of the heterointerfaces. in particular, at the heterointerface between fapbi3 and the titanium oxide (tio2) electron transport layer, an emissive interlayer that is chloride-containing and wide-bandgap (fapbi3-xclx) is formed spontaneously, which most likely serves multiple advantages leading to the observed pv performance enhancement: hole blocking and facilitation of electron injection from fapbi3 to tio2 without additional hole trapping. consequently, the present results provide novel insights into the widely employed macl additive in fapbi3 photoabsorbers and thereby propels the further advancement of pscs. furthermore, this study demonstrates effective investigation of carrier dynamics with regard to the heterointerface, which is challenging, using potent time-resolved spectroscopies, so will promote development in the material sciences."

Campbell Bjoern Braunschweig,"in many applications of polyelectrolyte/surfactant (p/s) mixtures, it is difficult to fine-tune them after mixing the components without changing the sample composition, e.g. ph or the ionic strength. here we report on a new approach where we use photoswitchable surfactants to enable drastic changes in both the bulk and interfacial properties. poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (pdadmac) mixtures with three alkyl-arylazopyrazole butyl sulfonates (cnaap) with -h, -butyl and -octyl tails are applied and e/z photoisomerization of the surfactants is used to cause substantially different hydrophobic interactions between the surfactants and pdadmac. this affects significantly the p/s binding and allows for tuning both the bulk and interfacial properties of pdadmac/cnaap mixtures through light irradiation. for that, we have fixed the surfactant concentrations at values where they exhibit pronounced surface tension changes upon e/z photoisomerization with 365 nm uv light (z) and 520 nm green (e) light and have varied the pdadmac concentration. the electrophoretic mobility can be largely tuned by photoisomerisation of cnaap surfactants and p/s aggregates, which can even exhibit a charge reversal from negative to positive values or vice versa. in addition, low colloidal stability at equimolar concentrations of pdadmac with cnaap surfactants in the e configuration lead to the formation of large aggregates in the bulk which can be redissolved by irradiation with uv light when the surfactant‘s alkyl chain is short enough (c0aap). vibrational sum-frequency generation (sfg) reveals changes at the interface similar to the bulk, where the charging state at air-water interfaces can be modified with light irradiation. using sfg spectroscopy, we interrogated the o-h stretching modes of interfacial h2o and provide qualitative information on surface charging that is complemented by neutron reflectometry, from which we resolved the surface excess of pdadmac and cnaap at the air-water interface, independently.

Gilson Tom Kurtzman,"the concept that a fluid has a position-dependent free energy density appears in the literature but has not been fully developed or accepted. we set this concept on an unambiguous theoretical footing via the following strategy. first, we set forth four desiderata that should be satisfied by any definition of the position-dependent free energy density, f(r), in a system comprising only a fluid and a rigid solute: its volume integral, plus the fixed internal energy of the solute, should be the system free energy; it deviates from its bulk value, f_bulk, near a solute but should asymptotically approach f_bulk with increasing distance from the solute; it should go to zero where the solvent density goes to zero; and it should be well-defined in the most general case of a fluid made up of flexible molecules with an arbitrary interaction potential. second, we use statistical thermodynamics to formulate a definition of the free energy density that satisfies these desiderata. third, we show how any free energy density satisfying the desiderata may be used to analyze molecular processes in solution. in particular, because the spatial integral of f(r) equals the free energy of the system, it can be used to compute free energy changes that result from the rearrangement of solutes, as well as the forces exerted on the solutes by the solvent. in particular, we discuss the thermodynamic analysis of water in protein binding sites to inform ligand design. finally, we discuss related literature and address published concerns regarding the thermodynamic plausibility of a position-dependent free energy density. the theory presented here has applications in theoretical and computational chemistry and may be further generalizable beyond fluids, such as to solids and macromolecules.

O'Brien Saer Samanipour,"the human exposome is represented by a vast number of chemicals, the fate and behavior of which remain largely unexplored. while modeling approaches are commonly employed to address this challenge, there is a recognized need for alternative molecular representations, such as molecular fingerprints. however, existing algorithms for computing molecular fingerprints may incorporate irrelevant or insufficient information for accurate activity prediction.  in this study, we present an algorithm designed to optimize molecular fingerprints. this algorithm combines the relevant bits of information, aiming to enrich the final fingerprint for predicting specific behavioral properties. to achieve this, relevant variables (i.e. bits) for prediction were collected from six non-hashed fingerprints and fused into a master fingerprint. we used fish toxicity as a proof of concept. the rfr model was developed based on the master fingerprint. it demonstrated comparable results to conventional descriptor-based models with r$^2$ $\approx 0.9$ for the training set and r$^2$ $\approx 0.6$ for the test set. the molecular fingerprints have the advantage of being consistent and interpretable. consequently, we were able to confirm the relevance of variables to the toxicity prediction. the final model outperformed each of the models based on individual fingerprints in the number of chemicals with prediction error, that fell in the range of +/- one standard deviation of residuals. the number of cases with the lower prediction error was on average four times higher for the master fingerprint-based model. the algorithm developed for optimizing molecular fingerprints is universal and can be applied to various case studies."

(4). we synthesized aspirin nhs ester (aspirin-nhs) to capitalize on this versatility in acetylating biomolecules. this tailored approach allows for the selective targeting of lysine residues within proteins, offering a specific tool to examine the functional consequences of lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. for this study, a model protein system was used. we selected β-conglycinin, a soy protein, that offers a pragmatic platform for investigating lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. β-conglycinin is rich in lysine residues, similar to nf-κb, making it homologous to this line of inquiry (5). we can examine the theoretical considerations of lysine acetylation with practical experimental observations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory dynamics within the nf-κb complex. this research contributes not only to the expanding toolkit for precise protein acetylation modulation but also enhances our understanding of nf-κb's regulatory dynamics in the context of cancer, establishing a bridge between chemical synthesis and biological investigation.

Stephens Maria-Magdalena Titirici,"phasing out petrochemical-based thermoplastics with bio-plastics produced in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly way is of paramount interest. among them, polylactic acid (pla) is the flagship with its production accounting for 19% of the entire bioplastics industry. glycerol electrolysis for producing the monomer lactic acid, while co-generating green h2, represents a promising approach to boost the production of pla, yet the reaction selectivity has been a bottleneck. here, we report a combined electrochemical and chemical route using a tandem pt/c-γ-al2o3 multicomponent catalyst which can achieve a glycerol-to-lactic acid selectivity of 60.2 ± 2.7%, among the highest performance reported so far. combining an experimental and computational mechanistic analysis, we suggest that tuning the acidic sites on catalyst surface is crucial for shifting the reaction towards the dehydration pathway, occurring via dihydroxyacetone intermediate. within the tandem effect, pt is the active site to electrochemically catalyze glycerol to dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde, while the γ-al2o3 provides the required acidic sites for catalyzing dihydroxyacetone to the pyruvaldehyde intermediate, which will then go through cannizzaro rearrangement, catalyzed by the oh- ions to form lactic acid.  this catalytic synergy improves the selectivity towards lactic acid by nearly two-fold. a selectivity descriptor (δg_(glad^* )-δg_(dha^* )) from density functional theory calculations was identified, which could be used to screen other materials in further research. our findings highlight the promise of tandem electrolysis  in the development of strategies for selective electrochemical production of high-value commodity chemicals from low value (waste) precursors."
