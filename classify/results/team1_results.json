chemical space, such models often have difficulty extrapolating beyond the chemistry contained in the training set. augmenting model with quantum mechanical (qm) descriptors is anticipated to improve its generalizability. however, obtaining qm descriptors often requires cpu-intensive computational chemistry calculations. to identify when qm descriptors help graph neural networks predict chemical properties, we conduct a systematic investigation of the impact of atom, bond, and molecular qm descriptors on the performance of directed message passing neural networks (d-mpnns) for predicting 16 molecular properties. the analysis surveys computational and experimental targets, classification and regression tasks, and varied dataset sizes from several hundred to hundreds of thousands of datapoints. our results indicate that qm descriptors are mostly beneficial to d-mpnn performance on small datasets, provided that the descriptors correlate well with the targets and can be readily computed at high accuracy. otherwise, using qm descriptors can add cost without benefit or even introduce unwanted noise that can degrade model performance. strategic integration of qm descriptors with d-mpnn unlocks potential for physics-informed, data-efficient modeling with some interpretability that can streamline de novo drug and material designs. to facilitate the use of qm descriptors in machine learning workflows for chemistry, we provide a set of guidelines regarding when and how to best leverage qm descriptors, a high-throughput workflow to compute them, and an enhancement to

 to remedy this problem, we have developed an enhanced-sampling protocol in which  (1)  unbiased folding simulations are performed and sparse tica is used to obtain features that best capture the slowest events in folding, (2)  umbrella sampling along this reaction coordinate is performed to observe folding and unfolding transitions, and (3)  the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding are

phosphorylation, and crosstalk thereof. studying these interactions requires proteins with unique ptm patterns, which are challenging to obtain by recombinant methods. standard peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation can produce such modified proteins, but are time-consuming and therefore typically limited to the study of individual ptms. herein, we report the development of flow-based methods for the rapid synthesis of phosphorylated myc sequences (up to 84 aa), and demonstrate the versatility of this approach for the incorporation of other ptms (n\u03b5 methylation, sulfation, acetylation, glycosylation) and combinations thereof. peptides containing up to seven ptms and five phosphorylations were successfully prepared and isolated in high yield and purity. our methodology was then applied in the production of ten ptm-decorated analogues of the myc transactivation domain (tad) to screen for binding to the tumor suppressor protein, bin1, using heteronuclear nmr and native mass spectrometry. we determined the effects of phosphorylation and glycosylation on the strength of the myc:bin1 interaction, and reveal an influence of myc sequence length on binding. our platform for the rapid synthesis of myc sequences up to 84 aa with distinct ptm patterns thereby enables the systematic study of ptm function at a molecular level, and offers a convenient way for an expedited screening of constructs."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wlx21", "Publication Date": "2024-02-27 00:00:00", "Title": "high-throughput quantum theory of atoms in

learning. an accompanying graph neural network package can be used for property prediction and allows users to readily use computed features for learning tasks. to test the efficacy of electron density-based data for machine learning, we benchmark several datasets including qm8, qm9, libe, tox21, and a green 2022 reaction dataset. this wide dataset diversity underscores the flexibility of qtaim descriptors and our package. in addition, we made our code high-throughput methods compatible with new versions of bondnet and chemprop architectures to allow for both reaction and molecular property prediction out-of-the-box. to motivate the use of qtaim features for varied prediction tasks we also perform extensive benchmarking of our new mod- els to existing benchmark models as well as to our own models without qtaim features. we show that almost universally, qtaim features improve model performance on our algorithms, chemprop, and bondnet. we also determine that qtaim can aid in

calculating even reaction energies on many surfaces can become computationally intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of states that must be considered. here, we investigate the feasibility of activation barrier prediction without knowledge of the reaction energy using linear and nonlinear machine learning (ml) models trained on a new database of over 500 dehydrogenation activation
