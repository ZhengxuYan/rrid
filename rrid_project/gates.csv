https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/7-121,28 Sep 2023,How resilient were family planning programs during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Evidence from 70 countries,"Karen Hardee,Rebecca Rosenberg,John Ross,Imelda Zosa-Feranil",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,19,210,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic fears of severe disruptions to family planning (FP) and access to services abounded.  This paper uses a unique data source, a special Supplement added to the 2021 round of the National Composite Index for Family Planning (NCIFP), to assess in depth the resilience of FP programs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic across 70 countries spanning six regions.   The 2021 NCIFP included 961 key informants who were asked questions to assess interference in the countries’ ability to achieve objectives, ability to maintain commitment to FP, and availability of information and services. Open ended responses added context.   All programs were affected; the magnitude of effects varies by region and country.  While the average resilience score, at 47 out of 100, implies middling levels of resilience, further analysis showed that despite interference in many components of programming, with some exceptions, the COVID-19 pandemic generally did not diminish government commitment to FP and programs remained resilient in providing access to services.  Common themes mentioned by 178 respondents (18.5% of respondents) included: fear of infection; disruption of services / difficulty with lockdown and travel restrictions; staff / facilities diverted to COVID-19; access to reproductive health services and contraceptive methods affected; shifts in services / outreach; interference with logistics & supplies, training & supervision, and M&E; lack of attention to FP/sexual reproductive health; financing reduced or diverted; and effects on existing partnerships.  A strong enabling environment for FP, which the NCIFP is designed to measure, was positively correlated with continued government commitment and access to contraceptive methods during COVID-19.   These findings are instructive for programming: it will face challenges and ‘interference’ when unanticipated shocks like COVID-19 occur, with strong FP programs best prepared to exhibit resilience."

https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/7-125,18 Oct 2023,The height premium: a literature review and meta-analysis,"Chloe Puett,Jere Behrman,Clint Pecenka,Christopher Sudfeld",,19,251,"The association between adult height and labor-market wages, or the “height premium” (HP), is an important input for quantifying potential economic benefits of nutritional interventions promoting growth. A large economics literature has evaluated this association; however, HP estimates differ greatly depending on the study populations and statistical methodologies used. We conducted a meta-analysis of HP estimates to describe the differences in estimates with different statistical methodologies and to examine potential effect modification of the HP by sex and country income category. We performed meta-analyses for studies using instrumental variables (IV) and ordinary least squares (OLS) methods, separately. OLS estimates were separated into those that were “low-adjusted” for confounding variables and “high-adjusted” for at least one common mediator variable, specifically cognition or schooling. Overall, in a total of 12 studies, the pooled estimates for IV studies indicated that each centimeter increase in height was associated with 3.58% greater wages (95% CI: 1.62-5.54%; I =97.5%, p<0.001)). In the 24 total OLS studies, low-adjusted estimates indicated an HP of 1.06% (95% CI: 0.85-1.28%, I =95.5%, p<0.001), while for high-adjusted estimates the HP was only 0.57% (95% CI: 0.41-0.73%, I =95.8%, p<0.001). Further, the meta-analysis found evidence of effect modification by sex in OLS estimates but not IV, and for both IV and OLS for country income category. Overall, the literature suggests a robust association between adult height and wages; however, the magnitude of the estimate appears to be dependent on statistical methods and covariates selected for multivariable models. Our findings also suggest there may be differences by sex and country income category. Additional analyses are needed taking into account a causal inference framework and, if adult height is being used to capture the cumulative effect on wages of nutritional exposures from conception through adulthood, studies should not adjust for potential mediators including cognition and schooling."

Lo,Peninah Munyua,Amy Herman-Roloff",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,46,339,"SARS-CoV-2 has extensively spread in cities and rural communities, and studies are needed to quantify exposure in the population. We report seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in two well-characterized populations in Kenya at two time points. These data inform the design and delivery of public health mitigation measures.    Leveraging on existing population based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) in two demographically diverse settings, a rural site in western Kenya in Asembo, Siaya County, and an urban informal settlement in Kibera, Nairobi County, we set up a longitudinal cohort of randomly selected households with serial sampling of all consenting household members in March and June 2021. Both sites included 1,794 and 1,638 participants in March and June 2021, respectively. Individual seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was expressed as a percentage of the seropositive among the individuals tested, accounting for household clustering and weighted by the PBIDS age and sex distribution.    Overall weighted individual seroprevalence increased from 56.2% (95%CI: 52.1, 60.2%) in March 2021 to 63.9% (95%CI: 59.5, 68.0%) in June 2021 in Kibera. For Asembo, the seroprevalence almost doubled from 26.0% (95%CI: 22.4, 30.0%) in March 2021 to 48.7% (95%CI: 44.3, 53.2%) in July 2021. Seroprevalence was highly heterogeneous by age and geography in these populations—higher seroprevalence was observed in the urban informal settlement (compared to the rural setting), and children aged <10 years had the lowest seroprevalence in both sites. Only 1.2% and 1.6% of the study participants reported receipt of at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by the second round of serosurvey—none by the first round.    In these two populations, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence increased rapidly in the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. It is important to prioritize additional mitigation measures, such as vaccine distribution, in crowded and low socioeconomic settings."
