https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/7-125,18 Oct 2023,The height premium: a literature review and meta-analysis,"Chloe Puett,Jere Behrman,Clint Pecenka,Christopher Sudfeld",,19,247,"The association between adult height and labor-market wages, or the “height premium” (HP), is an important input for quantifying potential economic benefits of nutritional interventions promoting growth. A large economics literature has evaluated this association; however, HP estimates differ greatly depending on the study populations and statistical methodologies used. We conducted a meta-analysis of HP estimates to describe the differences in estimates with different statistical methodologies and to examine potential effect modification of the HP by sex and country income category. We performed meta-analyses for studies using instrumental variables (IV) and ordinary least squares (OLS) methods, separately. OLS estimates were separated into those that were “low-adjusted” for confounding variables and “high-adjusted” for at least one common mediator variable, specifically cognition or schooling. Overall, in a total of 12 studies, the pooled estimates for IV studies indicated that each centimeter increase in height was associated with 3.58% greater wages (95% CI: 1.62-5.54%; I =97.5%, p<0.001)). In the 24 total OLS studies, low-adjusted estimates indicated an HP of 1.06% (95% CI: 0.85-1.28%, I =95.5%, p<0.001), while for high-adjusted estimates the HP was only 0.57% (95% CI: 0.41-0.73%, I =95.8%, p<0.001). Further, the meta-analysis found evidence of effect modification by sex in OLS estimates but not IV, and for both IV and OLS for country income category. Overall, the literature suggests a robust association between adult height and wages; however, the magnitude of the estimate appears to be dependent on statistical methods and covariates selected for multivariable models. Our findings also suggest there may be differences by sex and country income category. Additional analyses are needed taking into account a causal inference framework and, if adult height is being used to capture the cumulative effect on wages of nutritional exposures from conception through adulthood, studies should not adjust for potential mediators including cognition and schooling."

https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/7-116,09 May 2023,Strengths and weaknesses of the South-South Learning Exchange: a qualitative analysis of experts’ perspectives,"Isotta Triulzi,Rita Kabra,Komal Preet Allagh,James Kiarie",,25,363,"Background:      South-South learning exchange (SSLE) refers to an interactive learning process where peers exchange knowledge and experience to work towards a beneficial change. Despite organizations having recently increased the opportunity to run SSLEs, the SSLE support mechanisms and processes are not well documented in the scientific literature. This study explored experts’ perspective on SSLEs, strengths, weaknesses and mechanisms leading to outcomes.      Methods:   We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews on experience of participants and organizers of SSLEs. Data were collected between 1st September 2021 to 26th November 2021. All data were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed. In the analysis, we adopted an inductive approach derived from thematic analysis.      Results:   Sixteen experts who have participated in or facilitated one or more SSLE were interviewed. Experts’ accounts demonstrated an appreciation of participants’ empowerment, positive peer-to-peer “mind change” and convincing and powerful hands-on learning of this approach as strengths in the successful implementation of the SSLE. Being resource heavy, participant reluctance and absence of a validated methodology emerged as main weaknesses of the South-South learning approach, which could impair the effectiveness of this scheme.       Conclusions:   The SSLE is a promising approach to exchange knowledge and experience to work toward a desired change. This study suggested that this approach could gain robustness and credibility adopting a validated and systematic methodology. Furthermore, national and international funds improve availability of and accessibility to learning on the SSLE."
https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/7-121,09 May 2023,How resilient were family planning programs during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Evidence from 70 countries,"Karen Hardee,Rebecca Rosenberg,John Ross,Imelda Zosa-Feranil",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,19,206,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic fears of severe disruptions to family planning (FP) and access to services abounded.  This paper uses a unique data source, a special Supplement added to the 2021 round of the National Composite Index for Family Planning (NCIFP), to assess in depth the resilience of FP programs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic across 70 countries spanning six regions.   The 2021 NCIFP included 961 key informants who were asked questions to assess interference in the countries’ ability to achieve objectives, ability to maintain commitment to FP, and availability of information and services. Open ended responses added context.   All programs were affected; the magnitude of effects varies by region and country.  While the average resilience score, at 47 out of 100, implies middling levels of resilience, further analysis showed that despite interference in many components of programming, with some exceptions, the COVID-19 pandemic generally did not diminish government commitment to FP and programs remained resilient in providing access to services.  Common themes mentioned by 178 respondents (18.5% of respondents) included: fear of infection; disruption of services / difficulty with lockdown and travel restrictions; staff / facilities diverted to COVID-19; access to reproductive health services and contraceptive methods affected; shifts in services / outreach; interference with logistics & supplies, training & supervision, and M&E; lack of attention to FP/sexual reproductive health; financing reduced or diverted; and effects on existing partnerships.  A strong enabling environment for FP, which the NCIFP is designed to measure, was positively correlated with continued government commitment and access to contraceptive methods during COVID-19.   These findings are instructive for programming: it will face challenges and ‘interference’ when unanticipated shocks like COVID-19 occur, with strong FP programs best prepared to exhibit resilience."
https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/6-124,09 May 2023,Incentives and disincentives to private sector reporting on family planning in Kenya: ,"Gabrielle Appleford,Daniel Mumbia,Priya Emmart",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,66,645,"This study sought to understand private sector reporting on family planning in Kenya’s health information system (KHIS). We approached this through three lenses: governance, procedural and technical. Our study looked at these areas of interest in Kenya, complemented by deeper exploration in Nairobi County.   The study used mixed methods drawing on analysis from the KHIS and surveys, complemented by desk review. The qualitative research entailed group discussions with public sector personnel while more in-depth qualitative interviews were done with public and private sector respondents. A framework matrix was developed for the qualitative analysis. The study was approved by the Ministry of Health in March 2022 and conducted over the period March - May 2022.    From a governance lens, private sector respondents recognised the importance of registry and reporting as a government policy requirement. From a procedural lens, private sector respondents saw reporting procedures as duplicative and parallel processes as reports are not generated through digitised information systems. From a technical lens, private sector reporting rates have improved over time however other data quality issues remain, which include over- and under-reporting of family planning services into KHIS. Secondary analysis for Nairobi County shows that the private facility contribution to family planning has declined over time while family planning access through pharmacies have grown over the same period; there is no visibility on this shift within the KHIS. Changes in private sector family service provision have implications for assumptions underpinning modern contraceptive modelled estimates and programmatic decision-making.    There is limited monitoring of the incentives and disincentives for reporting by private health facilities into the KHIS. These have changed over time and place. Sustained private sector engagement is important to align incentives for reporting as is greater visibility on the role of pharmacies in family planning."

Most of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin blood clots. TXA decreases surgical bleeding and reduces deaths from bleeding after traumatic injury. When given within three hours of birth, TXA reduces deaths from bleeding in women with PPH. However, for many women, treatment of PPH is too late to prevent death. World-wide, over one-third of pregnant women are anaemic and many are severely anaemic. These women have an increased risk of PPH and are more likely to die if PPH occurs. There is an urgent need to identify ways to prevent severe postpartum bleeding in anaemic women. The WOMAN-2 trial will quantify the effects of TXA on postpartum bleeding in women with anaemia.   This statistical analysis plan (version 1.0; dated 22 February 2023) has been written based on information in the WOMAN-2 Trial protocol version 2.0, dated 30 June 2022. The primary outcome of the WOMAN-2 trial is the proportion of women with a clinical diagnosis of primary PPH. Secondary outcomes are maternal blood loss and its consequences (estimated blood loss, haemoglobin, haemodynamic instability, blood transfusion, signs of shock, use of interventions to control bleeding); maternal health and wellbeing (fatigue, headache, dizziness, palpitations, breathlessness, exercise tolerance, ability to care for her baby, health related quality of life, breastfeeding); and other health outcomes (deaths, vascular occlusive events, organ dysfunction, sepsis, side effects, time spent in higher level facility, length of hospital stay, and status of the baby).   WOMAN-2 will provide reliable evidence about the effects of TXA in women with anaemia.   WOMAN-2 was prospectively registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials registry ( ) on 07/12/2017 and ClinicalTrials.gov on 23/03/2018 ( )."

To inform training of health care providers, a study was conducted on a hybrid digital and in-person training which utilized Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to assess competency of provider trainees. This study represents one of few documented experiences using OSCE to assess the effectiveness of a digital training.   : From September – October 2021, in Enugu, Kano and Oyo states of Nigeria, 62 health care providers from public and private sector health facilities were trained in hormonal IUD service provision using a hybrid digital / in-person training approach. Providers, who were skilled in provision of copper IUD, underwent a didactic component using digital modules, followed by an in-person practicum, and finally supervised service provision in the provider trainee’s workplace. Skills were assessed using OSCE during the one-day practicum.    : Use of the OSCE to assess skills provided valuable information to study team. The performance of provider trainees was high (average 94% correct completion of steps in the OSCE).    : OSCE was used as a research methodology as part of this pilot study; to date, OSCE has not been integrated into the training approach to be scaled up by FMOH. Uniformly high performance of provider trainees was seen on the OSCE, unsurprising since provider trainees were experienced in providing copper IUD. If and when training is rolled out to providers inexperienced with copper IUD, OSCE may have a more important role to assess skills before service provision. The role of OSCE in design of hybrid digital / in-person training approaches should be further explored in rollout of hormonal IUD and other contraceptive technologies."

Rust,Michael J. Christian,Ciara J. Vance,Muhammed B. Bolajoko,Johanna T. Wong,Jeimmy Suarez-Martinez,Fiona K. Allan,Andrew R. Peters",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,93,799,"The California mastitis test (CMT) is a simple cow-side indicator of the somatic cell count (SCC) in milk, providing a useful tool in identifying cases of subclinical mastitis in cattle. Mastitis, and in particular subclinical mastitis, is a major concern in Ethiopia and Nigeria, yet detection is challenging due to cost and access to commercial CMT reagents.   Commercially available domestic detergents from Ethiopia and Nigeria were compared (n = 3 for each country) with the UK commercial CMT reagent in their ability to detect high SCC (>400,000 cells/ml milk).  Sensitivity and specificity of the CMT test were calculated for the different detergents and positive and negative predictive values were established.   The average sensitivities of the tests ranged from 28-75% for the Ethiopian detergents and 68-80% for the Nigerian detergents, compared to 76% for the UK domestic detergent.  Test specificities were 84-98%, 93-97% and 96%, respectively.   Overall, the detergents demonstrated higher specificity than sensitivity. Nigerian detergents performed better than the Ethiopian products, however, the study identified suitable domestic detergents from both Ethiopia and Nigeria, comparable to the UK commercial CMT reagent, and we recommend their use as alternative CMT reagents for livestock-keepers to aid in cost-effective diagnosis of mastitis."

We report seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in two well-characterized populations in Kenya at two time points. These data inform the design and delivery of public health mitigation measures.    Leveraging on existing population based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) in two demographically diverse settings, a rural site in western Kenya in Asembo, Siaya County, and an urban informal settlement in Kibera, Nairobi County, we set up a longitudinal cohort of randomly selected households with serial sampling of all consenting household members in March and June 2021. Both sites included 1,794 and 1,638 participants in March and June 2021, respectively. Individual seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was expressed as a percentage of the seropositive among the individuals tested, accounting for household clustering and weighted by the PBIDS age and sex distribution.    Overall weighted individual seroprevalence increased from 56.2% (95%CI: 52.1, 60.2%) in March 2021 to 63.9% (95%CI: 59.5, 68.0%) in June 2021 in Kibera. For Asembo, the seroprevalence almost doubled from 26.0% (95%CI: 22.4, 30.0%) in March 2021 to 48.7% (95%CI: 44.3, 53.2%) in July 2021. Seroprevalence was highly heterogeneous by age and geography in these populations—higher seroprevalence was observed in the urban informal settlement (compared to the rural setting), and children aged <10 years had the lowest seroprevalence in both sites. Only 1.2% and 1.6% of the study participants reported receipt of at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by the second round of serosurvey—none by the first round.    In these two populations, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence increased rapidly in the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. It is important to prioritize additional mitigation measures, such as vaccine distribution, in crowded and low socioeconomic settings."

Understanding the causes of stillbirth is crucial to developing effective interventions. In this commentary, investigators working across several LMICs discuss the most useful investigations to determine causes of stillbirths in LMICs. Useful data were defined as 1) feasible to obtain accurately and 2) informative to determine or help eliminate a cause of death.  Recently, new tools for LMIC settings to determine cause of death in stillbirths, including minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) – a method using needle biopsies to obtain internal organ tissue from deceased fetuses for histology and pathogen identification in those tissues have become available. While placental histology has been available for some time, the development of the Amsterdam Criteria in 2016 has provided a useful framework to categorize placental lesions. The authors recommend focusing on the clinical history, the placental evaluation, the external examination of the fetus, and, when available, fetal tissue obtained by MITS, especially of the lung (focused on histology and microbiology) and brain/cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and fetal blood (focused on microbiological analysis). The authors recognize that this approach may not identify some causes of stillbirth, including some genetic abnormalities and internal organ anomalies, but believe it will identify the most common causes of stillbirth, and most of the preventable causes."

They represent a 2.5% share of the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and contribute 10% to the current CPR. However, injections require a clinical setting or a healthcare provider for administration. A new method of subcutaneous presentation of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC), namely Sayana Press in Uniject™, has been introduced, which can be administered in nonclinical settings or self-administered by trained women. This study examined clients’ perceptions of the current depot medroxyprogesterone acetate-intramuscular injection (DMPA-IM) and its accessibility, availability, affordability, advantages, and disadvantages. In addition, it explored the benefits, barriers, and challenges regarding the new method of DMPA-SC (Sayana Press), especially considering self-injection.   The study was conducted in Sindh, Pakistan. Three focus group discussions were conducted with 9–13 female participants with different demographic characteristics. A semi-structured questionnaire was used. The discussion was recorded, transcribed, and translated from Urdu or Sindhi to English. Transcripts were coded precisely, and data analysis was performed using NVivo software.   Participants expressed moderate fear of self-injection and risk of an inaccurate prick, suggesting that DMPA-SC acceptance may not be challenging at a community level. They appreciated free services at public health facilities, as the affordability of private facilities may be challenging for those with low income. Most participants agreed to pay PKR 50–300 (approximately 1 USD or less) as service charges for a private facility, while some agreed to pay for transportation costs when lacking alternative methods.   DMPA-SC is a valuable alternative, provided its challenges are adequately addressed. Information about self-injection contraceptives is currently limited, and shared self-administration may be difficult without adequate training and counseling. Nevertheless, clients prefer the self-injection method for family planning to avoid transportation and private service charges."

Differences were noted between the rural and urban sites in terms of power/influence and interest rating of community stakeholders who could be involved in the sustainability phase of the VMMC response in Zambia. For example, in the urban setting, neighbourhood health committees (NHCs), health workers, leaders of clubs, community health workers (CHWs), radio, television and social media platforms were ranked highest. From this list, social media and television platforms were not highly ranked in rural areas. Some stakeholders had more sources of power than others. Forms or sources of power included technical expertise, local authority, financial resources, collective action (action through schools, churches, media platforms, other community spaces), and relational power.   Key roles and strategies included strengthening and broadening local coordination systems, enhancing community involvement, promoting community-led monitoring and evaluation, through the use of locally recognised communication spaces and channels, facilitating ownership of VMMC, and improving local accountability processes in VMMC activities.    By consulting with the most relevant stakeholders, and considering community needs in programme development, the VMMC programme may be able to leverage the community structures and systems to reduce long term demand generation costs for VMMC and increase the acceptability and frequency of male circumcision."

When considering the cumulative effect of discussions of FP at ANC, pre-discharge after childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination visits, we found that discussion of FP at a greater number of visits resulted in increased uptake of modern contraception by one-year postpartum. A greater number of FP discussions was associated with higher long-acting reversible contraceptive use relative to non-use and relative to short-acting method use.   : Despite high attendance, there are missed opportunities to discuss FP when AGYW access care."

Mwangi,Magaret Kelaher,Khic-Houy Prang,Ricardo Ataíde,Sant-Rayn Pasricha,Kamija Samuel Phiri",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,79,1003,"The study objective was to explore opinions, identify experiences, and describe perspectives on the acceptability of intravenous (IV) iron to treat anaemia in pregnancy and identify potential barriers and facilitators of introducing IV iron in the Malawian healthcare system.    We conducted 15 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions with pregnant women, and seven in-depth interviews with health workers at a community-based health centre in Blantyre and a tertiary hospital in Zomba.    Most women who used IV iron treatment during the second trimester of pregnancy reported feeling better and stronger after receiving the intervention. Women perceived that IV iron treatment worked faster and increased their haemoglobin count. However, cultural beliefs that IV iron treatment will cause miscarriage and the perception that study procedures involved Satanism and vampirism practices were barriers to acceptability. Health workers found IV iron treatment easy to administer because it is a single-dose treatment, simultaneously reducing the burden for pregnant women taking daily oral iron tablets. However, health workers expressed concerns about the costs and the need to train health workers before the large-scale implementation and integration of IV iron treatment into Malawi’s routine care.    Despite the perceived concerns and challenges experienced in participating in the first IV iron infusion trial in Malawi, participants’ reflections suggest that IV iron infusion is acceptable for treating iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. Participant advocate groups can offer a peer-to-peer education approach to sensitize and engage community members on the benefits of treatment and dispel concerns when the country contemplates integrating IV iron infusion for treating anaemia in pregnancy in Malawi."

There is hope that giving TXA shortly before or immediately after birth could prevent postpartum bleeding. Extending the use of TXA to prevent harmful postpartum bleeding could improve outcomes for millions of women; however we must carefully consider the balance of benefits and potential harms. This article describes the protocol for a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness and safety of TXA for preventing postpartum bleeding in all women giving birth, and to explore how the effects vary by underlying risk and other patient characteristics.    Methods: We will search for prospectively registered, randomised controlled trials involving 500 patients or more assessing the effects of TXA in women giving birth. Two authors will extract data and assess risk of bias. IPD data will be sought from eligible trials. Primary outcomes will be life-threatening bleeding and thromboembolic events. We will use a one-stage model to analyse the data. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to explore whether the effectiveness and safety of TXA varies by underlying risk, type birth, maternal haemoglobin (Hb), and timing of TXA. This protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022345775).   Conclusions: This systematic review and IPD meta-analysis will address important clinical questions about the effectiveness and safety of the use of TXA for the prevention of postpartum bleeding that cannot be answered reliably using aggregate data and will inform the decision of who to treat.       PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345775   Keywords    Anti-fibrinolytics; Tranexamic acid; childbirth; postpartum haemorrhage; meta-analysis"

However, it is underutilized in many countries. Family-led postnatal care (FPNC) is an innovative postnatal care service delivery model that leverages self-care principles to address key barriers identified in the Ethiopian context, including women’s preference to stay home in the first week after delivery and receive support from trusted family members. Utilizing an improved discharge process, coupled with user-friendly monitoring devices made available as a home care kit kept with preferred community custodians, this self-care model for postnatal care will be evaluated as a potential solution to very low coverage of postnatal care in the first week of life.    : The study will use mixed sequential methods: quantitative pre-intervention and post-intervention survey and phenomenological qualitative study. Four health centers in Ada Districtof Oromia, Ethiopia will be purposively selected. A pre-intervention survey will measure coverage and content of postnatal checks and care-seeking behavior. Health centers will then implement family led postnatal care. Once FPNC is initiated, post-intervention quantitative data will be collected. Approximately 218 postnatal women are to be included in the quantitative survey.  Qualitative interviews with approximately 20 mothers, 20 partners, 20 families, eight health managers, 12 postnatal discharge counselors, 20 health extension workers, and eight home care kit custodians will be conducted. A quantitative measurement of sustainability six months after the endline will also be assessed.   : Optimally, the study will contribute evidence to inform decision makers locally and globally on whether FPNC is a feasible and acceptable service delivery model for postnatal care, and whether it improves women’s empowerment and/or increases men’s support and connection to women and newborns in the early postnatal period."

Washabaugh,Sophie E. Moore,Andrew M. Doel,Saikou Drammeh,Ken K. Ong,David B. Dunger,Andrew M. Prentice,Robin M. Bernstein",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,32,207,"Although breastfeeding is common in The Gambia, high rates of undernutrition in children under five highlight the importance of understanding drivers of particular feeding patterns in this environment, especially early introduction of non-breast milk foods (NBMFs). The country’s marked seasonality, which is associated with annual food insecurity and heavy maternal workload, may influence breastfeeding patterns; however, longitudinal assessments of infant diet in relationship to such factors are limited. We aimed to characterize infant breastfeeding patterns and timing of introduction of local complementary foods in a rural Gambian population across the first twelve months of life. Potential environmental and sociodemographic predictors of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) duration were explored in order to identify factors that may influence infant feeding decisions in this population.   Data from dietary questionnaires (administered every ten days until 12 months of age) collected as a part of the Hormonal and Epigenetic Regulators of Growth study (2013-2018) were used to calculate EBF duration in a subsample of 194 mother-infant pairs. Socioeconomic questionnaires and Principal Component Analysis were used to calculate household sociodemographic position (SEP). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate potential predictors of EBF duration, including seasonality, SEP, and maternal and infant factors.   Mean age at introduction of food or liquid other than maternal milk was five months (±1.5). At twelve months, 98.7% of infants continue to receive some maternal milk. Being born in  May significantly predicted shorter EBF duration by -1.68 months (95% CIs: -2.52, -0.84mo; P<.0001). SEP, maternal parity, and infant sex were non-significant predictors of EBF duration.   Maternal milk is a vital component of infant diet across the first twelve months of life in this population. Earlier introduction of NBMFs coincides with the annual period where maternal agricultural workload intensifies in this region, though additional investigation is warranted."

We hypothesize that a schedule with a single priming and a booster dose (1p+1) may maintain similar levels of protection for the community by sustaining herd immunity, once circulation of vaccine types has been controlled.     We will conduct a cluster randomized trial with four intervention arms (1p+1, 0p+1, 2p+1, 3p+0) and three unvaccinated clusters in the 27 communes of Nha Trang, central Vietnam.

Recent work has more clearly defined these norms, both at the individual and community/collective levels. However, past research on the effect of social norms on contraceptive use has focused mainly on the influence of individual-level norms, largely among women only, contributing to mixed findings.    This study addresses this gap through the use of multilevel models to identify associations between collective gender, fertility, and family planning norms and individual use of modern contraceptives for both men and women, using recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Nigeria and Zambia. Multiple measures of variation, including community-level random effects and the intraclass correlation, are calculated, providing evidence of the general effect of community factors on behavior.    Our findings support the importance of social, demographic and economic context on how collective gender, fertility, and family planning norms relate to modern contraceptive use. Different social norms are associated with use in the two countries, and, even within the same country, men and women’s use are influenced by different norms. Among the examined norms, only collective fertility norms were associated with use for all the groups examined, consistently associated with lower use of modern contraception. Overall, clustering at the community level explained a larger proportion of variance in individual use in men compared to women, suggesting that men’s behavior was more consistently associated with the measured social norms than women’s.    These findings suggest that careful attention should be paid to understanding and measuring social norms when considering programs or policy around the provision of modern contraception and that these should not assume that social norms influence men and women’s behaviors in the same way."

We conducted a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic host-blood transcriptomic signatures of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV).      We systematically searched online databases for studies published in English between 1990-2020. Eligible studies included PLHIV of any age in test or validation cohorts, and used microbiological or composite reference standards for TB diagnosis. Inclusion was not restricted by setting or participant age. Study selection, quality appraisal using the QUADAS-2 tool, and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Thereafter, narrative synthesis of included studies, and comparison of signatures performance, was performed.      We screened 1,580 records and included 12 studies evaluating 31 host-blood transcriptomic signatures in 10 test or validation cohorts of PLHIV that differentiated individuals with TB from those with HIV alone, latent   infection, or other diseases (OD). Two (2/10; 20%) cohorts were prospective (29 TB cases; 51 OD) and 8 (80%) case-control (353 TB cases; 606 controls) design. All cohorts (10/10) were recruited in Sub-Saharan Africa and 9/10 (90%) had a high risk of bias. Ten signatures (10/31; 32%) met minimum WHO Target Product Profile (TPP) criteria for TB triage tests. Only one study (1/12; 8%) evaluated prognostic performance of a transcriptomic signature for progression to TB in PLHIV, which did not meet the minimum WHO prognostic TPP.      Generalisability of reported findings is limited by few studies enrolling PLHIV, limited geographical diversity, and predominantly case-control design, which also introduces spectrum bias. New prospective cohort studies are needed that include PLHIV and are conducted in diverse settings. Further research exploring the effect of HIV clinical, virological, and immunological factors on diagnostic performance is necessary for development and implementation of TB transcriptomic signatures in PLHIV."

Our primary goal was to identify the incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with VMMC and to assess the safety profile among adolescent boys 10 – 14 years.     : We searched the databases MEDLINE and Embase, WHO, and conference abstracts from 2005 to 2019. The incidence of AEs was estimated by type of AE, size of study and age.     : We retained 40 studies. Severe and moderate AEs overall were estimated at 0.30 per 100 VMMC clients with wide variability per study type. A higher rate was noted in small and moderate scale programmes and device method research studies compared with larger scale programmes. There was a limited number of studies reporting AEs among younger adolescent boys and they had higher infection-related AEs than those aged 20 years and older. Case studies noted rare AEs such as necrotizing fasciitis, tetanus, and glans injury.     : AE rates were comparable to those from the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that led to recommendations and implementation of VMMC in high HIV burden countries, despite being implemented in low resource settings. Clients over time have increasingly included adolescents under the age of 15 years. Studies suggest potentially higher risks in this age group. As VMMC services are sustained, patient safety surveillance systems and promoting a patient safety culture are crucial to identify and mitigate potential harms from medical male circumcision."

One in eight users (12.6%, n=292/2317) reported seeking additional medical care after taking the abortion pills. Most (87.5%, n=1551/1773) reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the abortion.     Our study confirms that self-managed abortion is a process that people can do safely and effectively with community support and without medical supervision. In the context of a global backlash against abortion rights, self-managed abortion is an integral part of a spectrum of options for abortion care that must be made available to all."

The pandemic significantly impacted Brazil, pressuring its healthcare system for several months, with high mortality rates, even among the youngest population. Cohort studies combining disease surveillance are essential for understanding virus circulation in the community, surrogates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, and demand for health resources.   Here, we present the protocol for a community-based prospective cohort study in the largest complex of   (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Complexo da Maré). The study participants are residents initially recruited during a massive vaccination campaign in the community. Five waves of data collection at approximately six-month intervals were planned. The first two waves have been completed at the time of writing this study protocol, and the third is underway. The protocol comprises interviews, blood sampling, and records linkage with secondary data to enrich the profiles of cohort participants and community information. We will describe COVID-19 seroprevalence, socio-demographic characteristics, and the burden of COVID-19, followed by estimating the association of socioeconomic factors and the burden of disease with seroprevalence.   The primary aims of the study are to assess COVID-19 clinical, epidemiological and genomic profiles and outcomes in residents from Maré, including vaccine effectiveness, surrogates of immune protection, virus transmission in households, and the overall burden of the pandemic."

Gill",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,29,306,"The contribution of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) has received little attention in global health. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of SUID in Lusaka, Zambia.   Verbal autopsies were conducted on infants who died in Lusaka, between 2017 and 2020.  From these, we performed a qualitative analysis of the free text narratives of the final series of events leading to each infant’s death and classified these as symptomatic deaths or SUID. Any narrative that described an infant who was otherwise healthy with no antecedent illness prior to death and found dead in bed after a sleep episode was classified as SUID. We used logistic regression to test for statistical differences between asymptomatic deaths and SUIDs on key infant, maternal and other risk factors of SUIDs.   Eight hundred and nine verbal autopsies were conducted with families of decedent infants younger than six months of age. A total of 92.6% (749/809) had presented with symptoms prior to death, whereas 7.4% (60/809) died without preceding symptoms or obvious cause of death. Of these, 16/60 were compatible with accidental suffocation deaths, and 54/60 appeared to be sudden infant death syndrome.  SUID deaths were concentrated in infants younger than two months of age with peak age of one to two months. Age at death was the only significant factor in multivariate analysis. Infants aged between one and two months had 2.84 increased odds of suspected SUIDs compared to infants in the first month of life (aOR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.31, 6.16).   Our findings suggest SUID could be accounting for a significant proportion of infant deaths in Zambia, but this cause of infant mortality is going unrecognized. Public health interventions in Zambia, and Africa more broadly, are likely overlooking SUIDs as an important cause of infant mortality."

We aimed to describe the variation in circumstances for management of such resistant infections in a group of African public-sector hospitals participating in a major research study.      We gathered data from eight hospitals across sub-Saharan Africa to describe hospital services, infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship activities, using two WHO-generated tools. We collected monthly cross-sectional data on availability of antibiotics in the hospital pharmacies for bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacterales. We compared the availability of these antibiotics to actual patient-level use of antibiotics in confirmed Enterobacterales bloodstream infections (BSI).   Hospital circumstances for institutional management of resistant BSI varied markedly. This included self-evaluated infection prevention level (WHO-IPCAF score: median 428, range 155 to 687.5) and antibiotic stewardship activities (WHO stewardship toolkit questions: median 14.5, range 2 to 23). These results did not correlate with national income levels. Across all sites, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were the most consistently available antibiotic agents, followed by amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, gentamicin and co-trimoxazole. There was substantial variation in the availability of some antibiotics, especially carbapenems, amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam with degree of access linked to national income level. Investigators described out-of-pocket payments for access to additional antibiotics at 7/8 sites. The in-pharmacy availability of antibiotics correlated well with actual use of antibiotics for treating BSI patients.     There was wide variation between these African hospitals for a range of important circumstances relating to treatment and control of severe bacterial infections, though these did not all correspond to national income level. For most antibiotics, patient-level use reflected in-hospital drug availability, suggesting external antibiotics supply was infrequent. Antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections could plausibly show different clinical impacts across sub-Saharan Africa due to this contextual variation."

Strengthening DTC was one of its focuses to improve overall supply chain management (SCM). The objective of this study are to review the evolution of DTCs in Ethiopia from their early years to current practice and identify the major driving and hindering factors for their functionality.  A descriptive mixed study design was employed. The study made use of qualitative data supplemented with quantitative data, generated from both primary and secondary sources through key informant interviews and desk review methods.  DTCs were introduced in Ethiopia in the early 1980s. The mandate of DTCs has been given to four different government organizations during that time. As a result, due to a lack of coordination among these organizations, its implementation was lagging. Recently, the government and its partners have given attention to DTCs. More than 5847 professionals underwent DTC training from 2016 onwards. DTC establishment in health facilities improved from 85% to 98% between 2015 and 2019 during baseline and end-line assessments carried out by CHAI/CSP. Similarly, DTC functionality in HFs improved from 20% to 63%. The CHAI/CSP regular supervision data analysis revealed that DTC establishment improved from 83% to 100% of HFs, while its functionality improved from 5% to 72% between 2016 and 2019, respectively. A chi-square test of independence examining the relationship between facility and pharmacy head training on DTCs and functionality of DTC in the same facility revealed a significant association between the two variables at p<0.0001.    Providing consistent capacity building and availing strong monitoring and evaluation system improves functionality of DTCs. Moreover, national coordinating bodies for DTCs and similar structures at Regional Health Bureaus and woreda health offices should be established."

Heimburger,Wilbroad Mutale,Selestine Nzala,C. William Wester,Justor Banda,Lloyd Mulenga,Mpanji Siwingwa,Jim Todd",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,20,235,": Tenofovir regimens remain the preferred formulations in the HIV guidelines for adolescents and young adults in Zambia and globally. However, some adolescents and young adults are maintained on abacavir by clinicians because of anxiety about possible proximal tubular dysfunction from tenofovir. We assessed the effect of two regimens on proximal tubular function in adolescents and young adults living with HIV.   : This was a cross-sectional study involving 180 participants with HIV receiving either tenofovir or abacavir for ≥12 months at the largest tertiary teaching hospital. Two first-morning urine and blood specimens were collected and analyzed for proximal tubular markers, glomerular function, electrolytes, and routine monitoring tests. Proximal tubular function was determined by measuring the fractional excretion of phosphate (FePO4). Proximal tubular dysfunction was defined by FePO4 ≥20% regardless of serum phosphate and FePO4  ≥10-20% when serum phosphate was below 0.81mmol/L.   : The prevalence of proximal tubular dysfunction was 6% and was higher in the tenofovir group than the abacavir (10% vs. 2%, p<0.058). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, tenofovir was not associated with worse proximal tubular function. Age, urine b microglobulin: creatinine ratio, C-reactive protein, and urine protein: creatinine ratio was all associated with worsening proximal tubular dysfunction. Reduced estimated glomelurar filtration rate (eGFR) was found in four (2.2%) participants; three of which were on tenofovir.   : Proximal tubular dysfunction defined by FePO4 was more prevalent in the tenofovir group than the abacavir group, but not after adjusting for age. Our findings should be interpreted with caution as age differences between the two groups confounded the results."

As part of the South to South Learning Network (SSLN), country-level data on HIV prevention programmes for sex workers were collected by 10 African countries, using the PSAT to self-assess their HIV prevention progress.    Data were collected August 2020 to July 2021 from participating countries. In each country, a technical team of 8-10 members completed the tool with support from the SSLN. The PSAT collects data for three programme domains: management, implementation and outcomes and sustainability, each of which comprises essential programme functions and elements. Once all elements are scored, the tool automatically calculates the final scores for each domain, on a scale of 1-5. Also, 15 interviews were conducted with 15 country leaders to understand the ease and usefulness of the PSAT process.    The overall PSAT scores ranged between 4.1 (Kenya) to 2.3 in Zambia. Of the three domains, Programme Management achieved the highest scores, with four countries (Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa) scoring more than four. High scores were seen in the Programme Implementation domain as well; five countries (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi and Uganda) scored between 3 to 4. For Programme Outcomes and Sustainability, other than Kenya, which did not score the outcomes, all countries scored poorly with scores ranging between 3.8 to 1.5. Comparing PSAT scores with UNAIDS suggested epidemic metrics have shown that countries with the highest PSAT scores also have high condom use rates and significant reductions in HIV incidence from 2010 to 2019.    This exercise has helped country’s leadership to self-reflect on their HIV prevention programmes, increase ownership and identify areas that need strengthening."

To reduce cases of polio from cVDPV of serotype 2, the serotype 2 component of the vaccine has been removed from the global vaccine supply, but outbreaks of cVDPV2 have continued. The objective of this work is to understand the factors associated with later detection in order to improve detection of these unwanted events.    The number of nucleotide differences between each cVDPV outbreak and the oral polio vaccine (OPV) strain was used to approximate the time from emergence to detection. Only independent emergences were included in the analysis. Variables such as serotype, surveillance quality, and World Health Organization (WHO) region were tested in a negative binomial regression model to ascertain whether these variables were associated with higher nucleotide differences upon detection.    In total, 74 outbreaks were analysed from 24 countries between 2004-2019. For serotype 1 (n=10), the median time from seeding until outbreak detection was 572 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 279-2016), for serotype 2 (n=59), 276 (95% UI 172-765) days, and for serotype 3 (n=5), 472 (95% UI 392-603) days. Significant improvement in the time to detection was found with increasing surveillance of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and adequate stool collection.    cVDPVs remain a risk; all WHO regions have reported at least one VDPV outbreak since the first outbreak in 2000 and outbreak response campaigns using monovalent OPV type 2 risk seeding future outbreaks. Maintaining surveillance for poliomyelitis after local elimination is essential to quickly respond to both emergence of VDPVs and potential importations as low-quality AFP surveillance causes outbreaks to continue undetected. Considerable variation in the time between emergence and detection of VDPVs were apparent, and other than surveillance quality and inclusion of environmental surveillance, the reasons for this remain unclear."

This problem is called “uninformativeness”. Some high-risk indicators of uninformativeness can be identified at the stage of drafting the protocol, however the necessary information can be hard to find in unstructured text documents.   : We have developed a browser-based tool which uses natural language processing to identify and quantify the risk of uninformativeness. The tool reads and parses the text of trial protocols and identifies key features of the trial design, which are fed into a risk model. The application runs in a browser and features a graphical user interface that allows a user to drag and drop the PDF of the trial protocol and visualize the risk indicators and their locations in the text. The user can correct inaccuracies in the tool’s parsing of the text. The tool outputs a PDF report listing the key features extracted. The tool is focused HIV and tuberculosis trials but could be extended to more pathologies in future.    On a manually tagged dataset of 300 protocols, the tool was able to identify the condition of a trial with 100% area under curve (AUC), presence or absence of statistical analysis plan with 87% AUC, presence or absence of effect estimate with 95% AUC, number of subjects with 69% accuracy, and simulation with 98% AUC. On a dataset of 11,925 protocols downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov, the tool was able to identify trial phase with 75% accuracy, number of arms with 58% accuracy, and the countries of investigation with 87% AUC.   : We have developed and validated a natural language processing tool for identifying and quantifying risks of uninformativeness in clinical trial protocols.

Methods of data collection leveraging technological solutions may provide avenues for increased anonymity for adolescents to share their experiences with contraception. With the use of WhatsApp and other smartphone-based messaging applications as platforms for qualitative methodologies, public health researchers may find increased access to adolescents through utilizing mediums that adolescents already engage with in their daily lives. This article describes the methodology of using WhatsApp for conducting focus group discussions with adolescents in Malawi, including lessons learned around data collection, data use, and data quality. In June 2018, VillageReach used WhatsApp to conduct focus group discussions (FGD) to collect qualitative data on contraceptive use from Malawian youth. WhatsApp FGD participants were male and female adolescents, aged 15-19 representing rural and urban populations across three geographic regions of Malawi (northern, central and southern). Youth researchers (YR), aged 22-25, were trained and facilitated fifteen WhatsApp FGDs, as   (12) and   (3) sessions. WhatsApp FGDs consisted of a YR sharing fictitious but contextually realistic ASRH scenarios, and managing the virtual discussion with questions and probing. Youth indicated comfort using WhatsApp to express their opinions and experiences related to contraceptive use and preferences. Based on the data collected, the researchers felt that use of the technology may increase willingness to provide additional levels of information during anonymized WhatsApp FGDs vis à vis traditional, in-person FGDs. Using WhatsApp as a methodological tool to facilitate FGDs has practical implications for data collection, data quality, and data analysis. This paper reports lessons learned and advantages and disadvantages of using WhatsApp to conduct FGDs in a low-resource setting. It also calls for developing guidelines and an ethical code of conduct for future use of mobile applications in qualitative research."

CP might have a prospective negative effect by down-regulating the inflammatory response suppressing antibody formation and promoting autoantibodies against interferons. Our objective was to establish the long-term safety profile of COVID-19 CP and determine if its administration increases the risk for further respiratory infections in older adults.    All participants included in the intention to treat analysis of a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 CP in older adults were invited to participate in this post-trial follow-up study.  Patients were strictly followed for at least 6 months after randomization. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with clinically confirmed acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, time to first respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, adverse events, and persistence of COVID-19 symptoms after initial infection.    142 patients were included in the study (total retention rate=92.8%). The mean age was 77.2 years (SD=8.6) and the median duration of follow-up was 10.4 months (IQR=1.63), with no differences among groups. 20 patients had a clinically confirmed ARI during the study. No differences were observed between groups in the proportion of ARIs (CP=11/72 and Placebo=9/70, p-value=0.678) and in the probability of ARI-free survival between groups (log-rank test p-value=0.63).

Many countries have incorporated a SDI option into national guidelines, but SDI uptake is not well documented. We estimated average time to ART initiation at 12 public healthcare facilities in Malawi, five in South Africa, and 12 in Zambia.   We identified patients eligible to start ART between January 2018 and June 2019 from facility testing registers and reviewed their medical records from HIV diagnosis to the earlier date of treatment initiation or 6 months. We estimated the proportion of patients initiating ART on the same day or within 7, 14, 30, or 180 days of baseline.   We enrolled 825 patients in Malawi, 534 in South Africa, and 1,984 in Zambia. Overall, 88% of patients in Malawi, 57% in South Africa, and 91% in Zambia received SDI. In Malawi, most who did not receive SDI had not initiated ART ≤6 months. In South Africa, an additional 13% initiated ≤1 week, but 21% had no record of initiation ≤6 months. Among those who did initiate within 6 months in Zambia, most started ≤1 week. There were no major differences by sex. WHO Stage III/IV and tuberculosis symptoms were associated with delays in ART initiation;  clinic size and having a CD4 count done were associated with an increased likelihood of SDI.   As of 2020, SDI of ART was widespread, if not nearly universal, in Malawi and Zambia but considerably less common in South Africa. Limitations of the study include pre-COVID-19 data that do not reflect pandemic adaptations and potentially missing data for Zambia. South Africa may be able to increase overall ART coverage by reducing numbers of patients who do not initiate ≤6 months."

Identifying women and their fetuses at risk for intrapartum-related morbidity and death could facilitate early intervention.    The Limiting Adverse Birth Outcomes in Resource-Limited Settings (LABOR) Study is a multi-country, prospective, observational cohort designed to exhaustively document the course and outcomes of labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period in settings where adverse outcomes are frequent. The study is conducted at four hospitals across three countries in Ghana, India, and Zambia. We will enroll approximately 12,000 women at presentation to the hospital for delivery and follow them and their fetuses/newborns throughout their labor and delivery course, postpartum hospitalization, and up to 42 days thereafter. The co-primary outcomes are composites of maternal (death, hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infection) and fetal/neonatal adverse events (death, encephalopathy, sepsis) that may be attributed to the intrapartum period. The study collects extensive physiologic data through the use of physiologic sensors and employs medical scribes to document examination findings, diagnoses, medications, and other interventions in real time.    The goal of this research is to produce a large, sharable dataset that can be used to build statistical algorithms to prospectively stratify parturients according to their risk of adverse outcomes. We anticipate this research will inform the development of new tools to reduce peripartum morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings."

Evidence shows that better management of primary health care facilities improves service quality, and that facility managers’ autonomy and training levels can augment their management performance. In India, there is scant research in this area. Research questions include: 1) What is the effect of facility-level autonomy on management performance and is the effect modified by management training? 2) Which aspects of facility management are most sensitive to facility-level autonomy and is the effect augmented by management training?    Using a multi-stage, regionally representative survey of health facilities in Odisha (n=396), a validated tool was used to measure management performance. An “autonomy score” was created to understand which facility management decisions are within a manager’s capacity. Multivariable linear regressions were used to assess the association of decision-making autonomy and management training with performance scores.    The mean performance score across all facilities was 0.657 (SD = 0.148) on a 0-1 scale; the mean autonomy score was 0.619 (SD = 0.305). Autonomy scores were not associated with a significant difference in performance scores; however, management training had an independent positive association with the human resources and monitoring domains of facility management.    In Odisha, India management training may improve management performance, and targeted training initiatives may strengthen a primary care facility’s ability to retain staff and monitor performance. Our data did not demonstrate a significant association between decision-making autonomy and management performance, highlighting a need for further study on how decision-making autonomy may augment a manager’s ability to leverage their skills to improve facility outcomes. In summary, neither management training nor decision-making autonomy alone will sufficiently improve primary care management but targeting the improvement of management training may improve a subset of performance outcomes."

We compared agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT among highly TB exposed goldminers in South Africa.    We enrolled HIV-negative goldminers in South Africa, aged ≥33 years with no prior history of TB disease or evidence of silicosis. Blood samples were collected for QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus. QFT-GIT was considered positive if TB1 tested positive; while QFT-Plus was positive if both or either TB1 or TB2 tested positive, as per manufacturer's recommendations. We compared the agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT using Cohen’s Kappa. To assess the specific contribution of CD8+ T-cells, we used TB2−TB1 differential values as an indirect estimate. A cut-off value was set at 0.6. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with having TB2-TB1>0.6 difference on QFT-Plus.    Of 349 enrolled participants, 304 had QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT results: 205 (68%) were positive on both assays; 83 (27%) were negative on both assays while 16 (5%) had discordant results. Overall, there was 94.7% (288/304) agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT-GIT (Kappa = 0.87). 214 had positive QFT-Plus result, of whom 202 [94.4%, median interquartile range (IQR): 3.06 (1.31, 7.00)] were positive on TB1 and 205 [95.8%, median (IQR): 3.25 (1.53, 8.02)] were positive on TB2.

Locally-developed and produced LNS may be more affordable and reduce logistical procurement and importation hurdles, while promoting private sector engagement and partnership.   : In northwestern Bangladesh, we conducted a community-based trial of complementary food supplementation to test its efficacy to reduce childhood stunting. Two locally-developed, small-quantity LNS (20g/day, rice-lentil and chick-pea based) were designed, developed first at small scale in the ‘kitchen’ laboratory under controlled conditions, followed by taking them to a local food manufacturer for larger production for the study. We describe here the partnership, required expertise and capacity, experiences, and lessons learned that made this uniquely complex undertaking possible   : Key steps in the journey included addressing the dynamics of clear communication between partners, executing on carefully assigned tasks and roles, correcting course when needed, and maintaining timeliness and roadmaps. Knowledge of food science and technology was key in solving many food-production challenges that were encountered in taking the laboratory recipe to the factory. Factory production was established and had to meet quality and hygiene criteria set for young children.   : We provide documentation of this experience as a model to describe the various steps and considerations and what is entailed in local LNS production. We highlight the importance of a well-conceived collaboration with clear roles that created a ‘win-win’ situation for all partners for achieving common goals, establishing improved technology at the factory, and building new capacity to produce such products for children in a low resource setting.

Most of this data, however, is from high income countries and less is understood about the variant’s disease severity in other settings, particularly in an African context, and when compared to the Beta variant.   A novel proxy marker, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target delay in the Seegene Allplex  2019-nCoV (polymerase chain reaction) PCR assay, was used to identify suspected Delta variant infection in routine laboratory data. All cases diagnosed on this assay in the public sector in the Western Cape, South Africa, from 1 April to 31 July 2021, were included in the dataset provided by the Western Cape Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC). The PHDC collates information on all COVID-19 related laboratory tests, hospital admissions and deaths for the province. Odds ratios for the association between the proxy marker and death were calculated, adjusted for prior diagnosed infection and vaccination status.   A total of 11,355 cases with 700 deaths were included in this study. RdRp target delay (suspected Delta variant) was associated with higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.86), compared to presumptive Beta infection. Prior diagnosed infection during the previous COVID-19 wave, which was driven by the Beta variant, was protective (aOR 0.32; 95%CI: 0.11-0.92) as was vaccination (aOR [95%CI] 0.15 [0.03-0.62] for complete vaccination [≥28 days post a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S or ≥14 days post second BNT162b2 dose]).

The mechanism behind this is unknown, but it is possible that differences in the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiome between HIV-unexposed and HIV-exposed infants could play a role in perpetuating some outcomes.    We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 170 NP swabs of healthy HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU; n=10) infants and their HIV(+) mothers and HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU; n=10) infants and their HIV(-) mothers. These swabs were identified from a sample library collected in Lusaka, Zambia between 2015 and 2016. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the maturation of the microbiome over the first 14 weeks of life to determine what quantifiable differences exist between HEU and HUU infants, and what patterns are reflected in the mothers' NP microbiomes.

The gut-lung axis is associated with disease, and these common infections, especially the parasite   are associated with malnutrition. We sought to evaluate the association of respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens with short-term growth among children hospitalised with diarrhoeal disease.   In this sub-study, we followed 27 children (two-24 months) who tested positive for  spp. for eight weeks with two weekly sampling of the respiratory and GI tract. Respiratory and stool pathogens were detected using quantitative molecular methods. Nutritional outcomes were assessed as length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) z-scores. Changes over the study period were compared using repeated analysis of variance and mixed effects model analysis.   In this period,104 sputum and stool samples were collected. All stool samples had at least one pathogen detected, with an average of 5.1 (SD 2.1) stool pathogens, compared to 84% of the sputum samples with an average 3.5 (SD 1.8).

Adolescent learners, from three townships in South Africa, participated in a 44 session, after-school asset-building intervention (GAP Year), over 2 years providing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education. This paper explores adolescent learners’ SRH, sexual risk and rights knowledge; perceptions about transactional sex; and contraceptive method preferences and decision-making practices.   The intervention was conducted in 13 secondary schools across Khayelitsha, Thembisa, and Soweto, South Africa. A baseline survey collected socio-demographic data prior to the intervention. Overall, 26 focus group discussions (FGDs): 13 male and 13 female learner groups, purposively selected from schools, after completing the intervention (2 years after baseline data collection). Descriptive analyses were conducted on baseline data. Qualitative data were thematically coded, and NVivo was used for data analysis.   In total, 194 learners participated in the FGDs. Mean age at baseline was 13.7 years (standard deviation 0.91). Participants acquired SRH and rights knowledge during the GAP Year intervention. Although transactional sex was viewed as risky, some relationships were deemed beneficial and necessary for material gain. Negative healthcare provider attitudes were the main barrier to healthcare service utilisation. There was awareness about the benefits of contraceptives, but some myths about method use. The injectable was the preferred contraceptive method, followed by the implant, with equal preference for condoms and oral pill.   An afterschool intervention at school is a viable model for the provision of SRH and rights education to learners. Recommendations include the need for risk reduction strategies in the curriculum, dealing with misconceptions, and the promotion of informed decision making. Endeavours to ensure health services are youth friendly is a priority to limit barriers to accessing these services."

McCarthy,Raymond Hutubessy,Susan Annemarie Wang",,55,506,"As SARS-CoV-2 spread in early 2020, uncertainty about the scope, duration, and impact of the unfolding outbreaks caused numerous countries to interrupt many routine activities, including health services. Because immunization is an essential health service, modeling changes in SARS-CoV-2 infections among communities and health workers due to different vaccination activities was undertaken to understand the risks and to inform approaches to resume services.   Agent-based modeling examined the impact of Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) delivery strategies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities and health workers for six countries capturing various demographic profiles and health system performance: Angola, Ecuador, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, and Ukraine.   Urban, fixed-post SIAs during periods of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increased infections within the community by around 28 [range:0-79] per 1000 vaccinations. House-to-house SIAs in mixed urban and rural contexts may import infections into previously naïve communities. Infections are elevated by around 60 [range:0-230] per 1000 vaccinations, but outcomes are sensitive to prevalence in health workers and SIA timing relative to peak.   Incremental increases in SARS-CoV-2 infection due to SIAs was small and in proportion to overall prevalence. Younger populations experience lower transmission intensity and fewer excess infections per childhood vaccine delivered. Large rural populations have lower transmission intensity but face a greater risk of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 during an SIA."

This qualitative study explores providers’ views on three hormonal FP methods and why they think young women may choose these methods in Niger.                                                         In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 FP providers in 24 government health centers in Dosso region, Niger between February-March 2020. Providers were asked about the suitability of different FP methods for women, including unmarried adolescents and young married women with children. The interviews were translated and transcribed from Hausa and Zarma into French, thematically coded, and qualitatively analyzed.      Many providers believed discretion to be the most important method attribute for women. Providers report preferring implants for young clients because of the more rapid return to fertility. They disagreed on whether implants or injectables are more discrete for clients. That said, providers felt that clients appreciate the implant’s discretion, effectiveness, long-acting nature, and ease of use.  Providers perceived that the majority of women choose injectables due to familiarity with the method, the fact that it is “invisible” to an outsider, and a lack of awareness of implants. Providers stated that while women may not initially choose the implant, when given more information about it, they were more open to adopting it, or switching from another method, and less likely to believe local myths. Providers believed that women find pills to be indiscreet.      The findings highlight that while providers have perspectives on suitable methods for certain women, they also recognize that clients have their own preferences, such as how discreet the method is. As programs continue to expand method choice and new contraceptive technologies undergo research and development, highly desirable features such as discretion need to be considered."

Hence, we conducted this study to generate evidence on the effect of regular deworming on STH infection status and anemia status of WRAs in rural Bangladesh.   This was a quasi-experimental study conducted in rural Bangladesh using existing healthcare delivery platform (Community Clinics) for mass deworming of WRAs. Catchment areas of two community clinics constituted the intervention arm, where the WRAs received two cycles of deworming four months apart on top of government recommended iron-folate supplementation (IFA), and catchment areas of two different community clinics were considered as the control arm where the study population received IFA but no deworming medication. Baseline and endline surveys were conducted on randomly selected participants to measure prevalence of anemia and STH infection using HemoCue 201+ and Kato-Katz respectively.    The study area contained 4791 women aged 15-49 years. Among them, 2441 lived in the intervention area and 2350 lived in the control area. Compliance to deworming medication and IFA was 82% (2001 out of 2441) and 79% (1938 out of 2441) for the two cycles, respectively. In the baseline survey there was no significant difference in prevalence of anemia between the intervention and control arms (63.7% vs 65.7%; p=0.522). However, the endline survey yielded significant difference in anemia prevalence between the arms (47.5% vs 65.7%, p<0.001) rendering a 14% reduction in anemia due the intervention (p=0.004). Similarly, our intervention was shown to reduce STH infection by 16% (p<0.001)   Our study clearly showed that regular deworming of WRA benefits their anemia and STH infection status."

The Indian Government has established Special Neonatal Care Units (SNCUs) in district and sub-district level hospitals to reduce neonatal mortality, but mortality rates have stagnated. Reasons include lack of personnel and training and sub-optimal quality of care. The role of medical equipment is critical for the care of babies, but its role in improving neonatal outcomes has not been well studied.      In a qualitative study, we conducted seven focus group discussions with SNCU nurses and pediatric residents and thirty-five key informant interviews and with pediatricians, residents, nurses, annual equipment maintenance contractors, equipment manufacturers, and Ministry of Health personnel in Maharashtra between December 2019 and November 2020. The goal of the study was to understand challenges to SNCU care. In this paper, we focus on current gaps and future needs for SNCU equipment, quality of the power supply, and use of SNCU equipment.     Respondents described a range of issues but highlighted poor power quality as an important cause of equipment malfunction. Other concerns were lack of timely repair that resulted in needed equipment being unavailable for neonatal care. Participants recommended procuring uninterrupted power supply (UPS) to protect equipment, improving quality/durability of equipment to withstand constant use, ensuring regular proactive maintenance for SNCU equipment, and conducting local power audits to discern and address the causes of power fluctuations.     Poor power quality and its negative impact on equipment function are major unaddressed concerns of those responsible for the care and safety of babies in SNCUs in Central India. Further research on the power supply and protection of neonatal equipment is needed to determine a cost-effective way to improve access to supportive care in SNCUs and desired improvements in neonatal mortality rates."

Systemic proteome, metabolome, lipidome, lipopolysaccharides, haemoglobin variants, toxins, pathogens, intestinal microbiome and biomarkers of enteropathy will be determined. Computational systems biology analysis will include machine learning and multivariate predictive modelling with stacked generalization approaches accounting for the different characteristics of each biological modality. This systems approach is anticipated to yield mechanistic insights, show interactions and behaviours of the components of biological entities, and help develop interventions to reduce mortality among acutely ill children.   . The CHAIN Network cohort and CNCC was approved by institutional review boards of all partner sites.

Upon infection, neutrophils can undergo NETosis, a cell death characterized by release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The role of NETosis in TB progression remains poorly characterized. We aim to characterize mechanisms underlying NETosis during TB pathogenesis by identifying genes that drive the cell death, and to determine their potential as markers of disease progression in high-risk individuals. Finally, we intend to evaluate neutrophil associated genes as targets for host directed therapy to reduce pathological damage caused by NETosis.     Quantitative PCR will be used to quantify expression of specific genes identified in the blood of individuals with active lung disease (n=30), compared to those from healthy (n=30) and latently infected individuals (LTBI) (n=30). In addition, temporal events associated with NETosis will be measured using live microscopy in a neutrophil in vitro model of  (Mtb) infection. Candidate genes found to be associated with NETosis will be targeted with pharmaceutical inhibitors.     Genes associated with neutrophil mediated cell death may serve as potential biomarkers of pathological damage and disease progression, as well as targets for host-directed therapy."

Yet few studies have explored contraceptive continuation of clients who received FP services from pharmacies and drug shops. This paper uses longitudinal data and looks at women’s contraceptive continuation approximately nine months after they received FP services from CPs and PPMVs in Kaduna and Lagos states.    Longitudinal data for this analysis come from an evaluation of the IntegratE project. 491 women were interviewed within 10 days after receiving a FP service from an IntegratE CP or PPMV and approximately nine months later. The dependent variable is contraceptive continuation at the follow-up interview and the independent variable is fertility intentions as reported at enrollment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between fertility intentions and contraceptive continuation.   89% of women continued using contraception approximately 9 months after the enrollment interview. Women who intended to have a child in more than two years were significantly more likely to continue using contraception compared to women who intended to have a child within two-years (AOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.1). Among women who were asked about the quality of care received, 93% said the CP/PPMV asked whether they wanted to have a/another child in the future and 85% said they were asked when they would like to have that child.   The fertility intentions of women who seek FP services from CPs and PPMVs in Nigeria can predict contraceptive continuation. As Nigeria task shares FP services to CPs and PPMVs, training on comprehensive FP counseling will be essential for scale-up. Since many women continued using FP, CPs and PPMVs have the potential to expand access to, and support women’s continued use of, FP."

Study objectives were to 1) test a ring-fenced census approach consisting of an outlet census in a defined geographical area and a household survey in a smaller inner ring, to comprehensively map the total FP market in a local geography; 2) explore FP supply market dynamism through longitudinal data collection from contraceptive outlets; and 3) test a methodology for directly linking household and outlet data to measure the relationship between contraceptive demand and supply.   Data were collected from study sites in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda from 2019 to 2020. Longitudinal outlet census data and repeated cross-sectional household survey data from women ages 18-49 were collected at three quarterly time points. Outlets were located in an outer ring geography to encompass locations likely visited by women sampled from a smaller inner ring. Data from women who received a contraceptive method in the past 12 months were linked to data for the outlet from which they received the method.   Datasets include product audits for 22,380 individual FP products, collected from a total of 1,836 outlets across 12 study sites.

One of these challenges is the lack of standard tools and procedures to connect researchers to policy makers. A tool such as the Target Policy Profile (TPoP) can help to close this gap, since it is designed to optimize dialogue around the evidence needed to effect a change in policy. In this paper, we assessed the policy making process in Cameroon and suggest how the process can be optimized using the TPoP.     This study reports on qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews of purposively selected individuals, and quantitative data extracted from strategic plans and reports of 17 vertical health programs in Cameroon.   The majority (10/17) of our respondents were males and had an average of 6.5 years’ experience in policy making in Cameroon. A relatively small number of interventions/policies (19) were introduced by the assessed programs between 2015-2020. An even smaller number (9) are planned for introduction in the upcoming years. Four major gaps were identified in the policy making process, including lack of standardized methods and tools, limited use of evidence, limited ownership of the process by the state, and limited evaluation of newly introduced policies/interventions. Our respondents considered the TPoP to be a useful tool, which can help improve policy development, implementation, and evaluation across their different programs.   The TPoP can help address gaps identified in the health policy making process in Cameroon. Continued advocacy to help stakeholders understand its value proposition as well as training them on its use cases, may facilitate its adoption and use in Cameroon."

We examined factors associated with continuing, discontinuing, and switching methods among injectable users obtaining services from public health facilities in the Indian states of Karnataka and Maharashtra.    The study team recruited respondents (N=1009) that had received their first injectable dose from in public sector facilities between February – May 2019 and conducted a follow-up visit at their residence in December 2020.

S. Mohanan,Avishek Hazra",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,36,376,"Globally, women’s empowerment is captured through different combinations of indicators related to their collective and individual empowerment. In this paper, the association of diverse domains related to women’s collective and individual empowerment on their reproductive and maternal health practices were assessed. Collective empowerment referred to a cluster of indicators measuring mutual support, rights, and access to services women received, as a result of membership in self-help groups (SHGs) focused on micro-finance activities. Women’s individual empowerment was measured through their perception to make decisions on their own, be mobile, financially self-reliant, self-confident in expressing themselves, having self-esteem and being free from spousal violence.    Cross-sectional data were collected in 2017 from 2,197 SHG members across 57 administrative blocks of Uttar Pradesh, India. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the sub-domains of individual and collective empowerment were developed. The reproductive and maternal health indicators included antenatal care, delivery preparedness, postnatal care and current contraceptive use. Bivariate and multivariate analyses, using logistic regression, were carried out to measure the association of sub-domains of women’s empowerment with health practices.    Collective and individual empowerment were independently and jointly associated with correct health practices. Women with greater empowerment through independent mobility, high self-esteem, access to financial resources, and confidence in interacting with a frontline worker, were more likely to access antenatal care. Similarly, delivery preparedness—which entailed deciding on the place of delivery, arranging for transportation during labor, and managing expenses for the delivery—was positively influenced by collective support from fellow SHG members. Receiving postnatal care was positively associated with self-confidence and financial autonomy, and current family planning method use was positively associated with self-confidence, lower spousal violence and confidence in support from the group.    Women’s collective and individual empowerment were independently and jointly positively associated with health outcomes among SHG members."

Evidence on the role of such interventions for improving community health outcomes is steadily emerging, including for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). However, these interventions are complex social processes with numerous actors, multiple components, and a highly influential local context. Unsurprisingly, determining the mechanisms of change and what outcomes may be transferable to other similar settings can be a challenge. We report our methodological considerations to account for complexity in a social accountability intervention exploring contraceptive uptake and use in Ghana and Tanzania.   : The Community and Provider driven Social Accountability Intervention (CaPSAI) study explores the relationship between a health facility-focused social accountability intervention and contraceptive service provision in two countries. This 24-month mixed-method quasi-experimental study, using an interrupted time series with a parallel control group, is being undertaken in 16 sites across Ghana and Tanzania in collaboration with local research and implementation partners. The primary outcomes include changes in contraceptive uptake and use. We also measure outcomes related to current social accountability theories of change and undertake a process evaluation.  We present three design components: aspects of co-design, ‘conceptual’ fidelity, and how we aim to track the intervention as ‘intended vs. implemented’ to explore how the intervention could be responsive to the embedded routines, local contextual realities, and the processual nature of the social accountability intervention.   : Through a discussion of these design components and their rationale, we conclude by suggesting approaches to intervention design that may go some way in responding to recent challenges in accounting for social accountability interventions, bearing relevance for evaluating health system interventions."

Prior economic analyses that sought to quantify the economic benefits of some interventions encountered insufficient data and evidence associated with non-polio-specific activities. The 2022-2026 GPEI Strategic Plan explicitly identified integration and gender equity as funded mandates that must move forward in parallel with polio eradication, but these goals remain vaguely defined from a health economic perspective.   : To ensure unambiguous and full accounting for all financial investments in the GPEI, polio eradication, and other desirable objectives, we identify the health economic analysis methods and inputs needed to ensure transparent financial accountability and cost-effective use of funds.   : Sufficient inputs and methods exist to characterize the health and economic benefits of polio-specific activities, but we identified the need for additional information and method development for some non-polio-specific and cost-sharing activities. Donors who seek to support non-polio-specific objectives as part of the GPEI may want to provide dedicated support financing for which it may be difficult to apply typical health economic criteria and to expect net health and/or net economic benefits.   : Given the mixture of funding sources provided to the GPEI, which includes support by governments and private donors, we recommend that the GPEI separately account for financial needs that represent necessities for polio eradication from those used for other stated objectives. An added layer of specificity that identifies all funds according to each activity, the accountable party and/or parties, and the associated measurable health or other outcome(s), will enable improved health economic analyses and reporting to donors who seek to track returns on their investments."

However, services offering the method are not widely available in Nigeria and little evidence exists on the dynamics of its use. We examined the continuation rate and satisfaction with the IUS among the user population.   : This prospective longitudinal phone survey involved a baseline survey of users at two-weeks post-insertion of the LNG IUS, recruited from 40 clinics across 17 states in Nigeria, with a follow-up survey at the 3  and 12  months. A total of 208 users were interviewed at baseline, 98 at three months, and 73 at 12 months. User family planning and the IUS use experiences were elicited, as well as the continuation rate and satisfaction with the method at three and 12 months.   : At three- and 12 months post-insertion, 96.9% (95% CI: 91.3, 99.3) and 91.8% (95% CI: 82.9, 96.9), respectively, reported still using the LNG IUS, with none out of the few users who discontinued the method reporting a method failure. Discontinuation was mainly a result of the experience of menstrual bleeding or amenorrhea (25.0%), experiences of pain with the method (18.8%), and partner complaining about strings (16.7%). High satisfaction with the LNG IUS (76.5% at three months and 86.3% at 12 months post-insertion) was reported. Satisfaction with LNG IUS was significantly associated with not having breast tenderness/pain (88.2%) and no vaginal bacterial infection (87.5%) at 12 months compared to experiencing breast tender/pain (50.0%) and vaginal infection (0.0%) (p<0.05).   : High user continuation and satisfaction with IUS indicates the positive potential of the method as a contraceptive in Nigeria."

We examine FP2020 country data for signs of inequity in gains in modern contraceptive prevalence (MCP).   We selected 11 countries (Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Haiti, Malawi, Mali, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) to conduct a bivariate analysis. We evaluated if MCP growth had been equitable by assessing MCP between two surveys stratified by residence, levels of education, age groups, marital status, and wealth.   In most countries, MCP increased among rural women and in seven African countries these gains were significant. In six countries, MCP gains were significant both among women with no education and in the lowest wealth group. MCP gains among young women aged 15-19 and 20-24 were seen in four African countries: Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.   Our findings suggest that between two surveys since 2010 many countries saw MCP gains across different dimensions of equity and do not suggest a focus on expanded coverage at the expense of equity. As the family planning community begins to look ahead to the next partnership, this analysis can help inform the emerging FP2030 framework, which includes equity as a guiding principle."

Condoms are inexpensive and provide protection against transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) as well as against unintended pregnancy. As many as 16 billion condoms may be used annually in all low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In recent years the focus of HIV programs as been on testing and treatment and new technologies such as PrEP. Rates of condom use have stopped increasing short of UNAIDS targets and funding from donors is declining.   We applied a mathematical HIV transmission model to 77 high HIV burden countries to estimate the number of HIV infections that would have occurred from 1990 to 2019 if condom use had remained at 1990 levels.   The results suggest that current levels of HIV would be five times higher without condom use and that the scale-up in condoms use averted about 117 million HIV infections.    HIV programs should ensure that affordable condoms are consistently available and that the benefits of condom use are widely understood.

This substudy was restricted to those at highest risk of TB (CD4<200 cells/mm  or unknown) who had a negative initial Xpert result.  At attendance for the Xpert result, a repeat sputum sample was stored, and further investigations facilitated per national guidelines. Participants were reviewed monthly, with reinvestigation if indicated, for at least three months, when sputum and blood were cultured for mycobacteria, and the stored sputum tested using Xpert. We defined TB as “confirmed” if Xpert, line probe assay or  culture within six months of enrolment were positive, and “clinical” if TB treatment was started without microbiological confirmation.   Amongst 227 participants with an initial negative Xpert result (63% female, median age 37 years, median CD4 count 100 cells/mm ), 28 (12%) participants had TB diagnosed during study follow-up (16 confirmed, 12 clinical); stored sputum tested positive on Xpert in 5/227 (2%). Amongst 27 participants who started TB treatment, the basis was bacteriological confirmation 11/27 (41%); compatible imaging 11/27 (41%); compatible symptoms 2/27 (7%); and unknown 3/27 (11%).    Amongst HIV-positive individuals at high risk of active TB with a negative Xpert result, further investigation using appropriate diagnostic modalities is more likely to lead to TB treatment than immediately repeating sputum for Xpert. TB diagnostic tests with improved sensitivity are needed."

The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network aims to ascertain causes of child death in high child mortality settings (>50 deaths/1000 live-births). We aimed to develop a “greenfield” site for CHAMPS, based in Harar and Kersa, in Eastern Ethiopia. This very high mortality setting (>100 deaths/1000 live-births in Kersa) had limited previous surveillance capacity, weak infrastructure and political instability. Here we describe site development, from conception in 2015 to the end of the first year of recruitment.    We formed a collaboration between Haramaya University and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and engaged community, national and international partners to support a new CHAMPS programme. We developed laboratory infrastructure and recruited and trained staff. We established project specific procedures to implement CHAMPS network protocols including; death notifications, clinical and demographic data collection, post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling, microbiology and pathology testing, and verbal autopsy. We convened an expert local panel to determine cause-of-death. In partnership with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute we developed strategies to improve child and maternal health.    Despite considerable challenge, with financial support, personal commitment, and effective partnership, we successfully initiated CHAMPS. One year into recruitment (February 2020), we had received 1173 unique death notifications, investigated 59/99 MITS-eligible cases within the demographic surveillance site, and assigned an underlying and immediate cause of death to 53 children.    The most valuable data for global health policy are from high-mortality settings, but initiating CHAMPS has required considerable resource. To further leverage this investment, we need strong, sustained, local research leadership, and to broaden the scientific remit. To support this, we have set up a new collaboration, the “Hararghe Health Research Partnership”."

We aimed to summarize the evidence of bacterial etiology of pneumonia in children ≤2 months of age.   : We conducted a systematic review considering studies evaluating a variety of syndromes associated with pneumonia, and reporting on laboratory confirmed etiologies, considering any diagnostic method and a variety of clinical specimens.  We searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, WoS, Central and Index Medicus Global published in any language till April 30 , 2021. We included studies addressing the outcomes of interest in children ≤2 months of age and reporting on clinical trials, observational studies, and case series with at least 10 events. Screening of citations and data extraction were conducted in duplicate by independent reviewers, according to the study protocol registered on PROSPERO. Descriptive analyses of the various etiologic agents by syndrome are reported.   We identified 3,744 citations, of which 22 publications reporting on 13 studies were included. Study methods varied significantly. Nonetheless, gram positive organisms, in particular  , were identified as important etiologic agents of pneumonia in children ≤2 months of age. Viral etiologies, in particular Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rhinovirus, and Influenza were also identified.   This review provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the etiologies of pneumonia in children ≤2 months of age, suggesting that PCV impact is expected to occur in this age group. These results also have major implications for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in this age group."

We synthesized recent studies of DSD model costs in five African countries.   : The studies included cluster randomized trials in Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe and observational studies in Uganda and Zambia. For 3-5 models per country, studies collected patient-level data on clinical outcomes and provider costs for 12 months. We compared costs of differentiated models to those of conventional care, identified drivers of cost differences, and summarized patient costs of seeking care.   : The studies described 22 models, including conventional care. Of these, 13 were facility-based and 9 community-based models; 15 were individual and 7 group models. Average provider cost/patient/year ranged from $100 for conventional care in Zambia to $187 for conventional care with 3-month dispensing in Zimbabwe. Most DSD models had comparable costs to conventional care, with a difference in mean annual cost per patient ranging from 11.4% less to 9.2% more, though some models in Zambia cost substantially more. Compared to all other models, models incorporating 6-month dispensing were consistently slightly less expensive to the provider per patient treated. Savings to patients were substantial for most models, with patients’ costs roughly halved.   : In five field studies of the costs of DSD models for HIV treatment, most models within each country had relatively similar costs to one another and to conventional care. 6-month dispensing models were slightly less expensive, and most models provided substantial savings to patients. Limitations of our analysis included differences in costs included in each study. Research is needed to understand the effect of DSD models on the costs of ART programmes as a whole."

In 2020, a global network of published experts on neurological disease and refugees was convened. Nine physician experts from nine countries (2 low, 1 lower-middle income, 5 upper-middle, 1 high income) with experience treating displaced people originating from 18 countries participated in three survey and two discussion rounds in accordance with the Delphi method.     A consensus list of priority interventions for treating neurological conditions in displaced people was created, agnostic to cost considerations, with the ten highest ranking tests or treatments ranked as: computerized tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans, levetiracetam, acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, paracetamol, sodium valproate, basic blood tests, steroids and anti-tuberculous medication. The most important contextual considerations (100% consensus) were all economic and political, including the economic status of the displaced person’s country of origin, the host country, and the stage in the asylum seeking process. The annual cost to purchase the ten priority neurological interventions for the entire displaced population was estimated to be 220 million USD for medications and 4.2 billion USD for imaging and tests.     A need for neuroimaging and anti-seizure medications for forcibly displaced people was emphasized. These recommendations could guide future research and investment in neurological care for forcibly displaced people."

Within this population, those in long-term facilities represent >50% of the total COVID-19 related deaths per country. Among those without symptoms, the rate of pre-symptomatic illness is unclear, and potential predictors of progression for symptom development are unknown.  Our objective was to delineate the natural evolution of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in elders and identify determinants of progression.      We established a medical surveillance team monitoring 63 geriatric institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina during June-July 2020. When an index COVID-19 case emerged, we tested all other eligible asymptomatic elders ≥75 or >60 years old with at least 1 comorbidity. SARS-CoV-2 infected elders were followed for 28 days. Disease was diagnosed when any COVID-19 manifestation occurred. SARS-CoV-2 load at enrollment, shedding on day 15, and antibody responses were also studied.      After 28 days of follow-up, 74/113(65%) SARS-CoV-2-infected elders remained asymptomatic. 54% of pre-symptomatic patients developed hypoxemia and ten pre-symptomatic patients died.  Dementia was the only clinical risk factor associated with disease(OR 2.41(95%CI=1.08, 5.39). In a multivariable logistic regression model, dementia remained as risk factor for COVID-19 severe disease. Furthermore, dementia status showed a statistically significant different trend when assessing the cumulative probability of developing COVID-19 symptoms(log-rank p=0.027).  On day 15, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 30% of the asymptomatic group while in 61% of the pre-symptomatic(p=0.012).  No differences were observed among groups in RT-PCR mean cycle threshold at enrollment(p=0.391) and in the rates of antibody seropositivity(IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2).      In summary, 2/3 of our cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected elders from vulnerable communities in Argentina remained asymptomatic after 28 days of follow-up with high mortality among those developing symptoms.

The scale-up of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and multiple novel HIV prevention products on the horizon offer countries a unique opportunity to expand innovative approaches to deliver comprehensive, integrated HIV prevention/SRH services.   This article comparatively analyzes findings from rapid assessments in Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe across key themes to highlight cross-country trends and contextual realities around HIV prevention/SRH integration, with a focus on oral PrEP and contraception. In Kenya and Zimbabwe, assessments were completed by Ministries of Health (MOH) and the HIV Prevention Market Manager and include 20 health facility assessments, 73 key informant interviews (KIIs) and six community dialogues. In Malawi, the assessment was completed by the MOH and Georgetown University Center for Innovation in Global Health and includes 70 KIIs and a review of national policies and program implementation in Blantyre. Findings were contextualized through a review of literature and policies in each country.   Across countries, the policy environment is conducive to HIV prevention/SRH integration, though operationalization presents ongoing challenges, with most policies preceding and not accounting for oral PrEP rollout. National coordination mechanisms, youth-friendly health services and prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs are promising practices, while siloed and resource-constrained health systems, limited provider capacity, underfunded demand generation and structural factors exacerbate barriers to achieving integration.   As new HIV prevention products are introduced, demand for integrated HIV prevention/SRH services is likely to grow. Investing in HIV prevention/SRH integration can help to ensure a sustainable response to the HIV epidemic, streamline service delivery and improve the health outcomes and lives of AGYW."

Under the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) partnership, countries were encouraged to develop costed implementation plans and action plans in an effort to provide 120 million additional women and girls with contraception. As FP2020 becomes FP2030, reviewing these previously-developed strategies helps understand the extent to which countries considered the engagement of men as an important aspect of their family planning portfolios.   We conducted textual analysis on commitments and implementation plans related to achieving FP2020 commitments in six countries in Africa and one in Asia to determine the extent to which male engagement was incorporated into country or subnational family planning goals, with particular focus on FP policy, program, and financial commitments.    Some of the documents analyzed included robust plans for including male engagement in their efforts to expand access to FP.  The strongest aspects of male engagement programming were those that sought to engage men as advocates for women’s access to and use of FP services, and improve their knowledge and attitudes related to contraception and reproduction. The weakest aspects were engaging men as users of services and, vitally, tackling underlying gender norms which hamper men’s and women’s health-seeking behaviors and attitudes.   Developing FP programs that target men and boys as people deserving of reproductive health services, as partners with women in building their families, and as social activists in their communities, will complement and strengthen existing FP programs as well as promote broader goals related to gender equality."

Within these countries, we looked at indicators suggesting success in terms of detecting disease, containing the outbreak, and treating those who were unwell. To support comparability, we measured indicators per capita (per million) and across time. We then used the indicators to identify three countries with emerging success stories to include some diversity in global region, population demographics and form of government.       We identified 66 countries that met our inclusion criteria on 18  May 2020. Several of these countries had indicators of success against the set indicators at different times in the outbreak. Vietnam had high levels of testing and successful containment with no deaths reported. South Korea had high levels of testing early in the outbreak, supporting containment. Germany had high levels of sustained testing and slower increases in cases and deaths than seen in other comparable settings.    At the time of our assessment, Vietnam and South Korea were able to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 and avoid the exponential growth in cases seen elsewhere. Germany had more cases and deaths, but was nevertheless able to contain and mitigate the outbreak.

The current debates on reimagining technical assistance focus on the existing challenges of the different types of technical assistance and the (re)construction of an ideal model for delivering this type of support, with little discussion about the dilemmas involved in making day-to-day decisions and trade-offs in implementation. This article presents technical assistance as a policy option for governments and details the existing models of delivering technical assistance, their limitations, and the required enabling conditions. The models presented focus on the type of role for the technical advisers- as doers (performing government functions), partners (working with the government to perform a specific role) and facilitators (enabling and facilitating change programmes to address wicked problems). Finally, the paper provides a practical account of the implications of the programme design and suggests potential opportunities for change particularly in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.

New contraceptive technologies (CTs) have the potential to improve uptake and continuation. CT development has a long-time horizon; products will be introduced into markets that look very different than today. Identifying viable investments requires an understanding of these future markets. For this work the 2040 potential contraceptive market is described utilizing seven market segments based on marital status, fertility preferences, and patterns of sexual activity outside of marriage.     Market size estimates are developed by country for all countries in the world for a current market (2020) and a future market (2040). United Nation’s (UN) population projections of the number of women of reproductive age (WRA) form the basis of this work. WRA are then segmented into market segments based on marital status, fertility intentions, and patterns of sexual activity outside of marriage.  Each segment is further subdivided by contraceptive use versus non-use.  Segmentation draws from UN projections, household surveys, census data, and modeling techniques developed for this work.    The largest market increases will be seen in Africa; most notably among the segment of married women wanting no more children. By contrast, Asia will see declines across all three married segments, coupled with increases among sexually active unmarried segments.  Levels of contraceptive use are projected to vary widely by segment, with differential patters across regions.    This analysis projects the impact of demographic changes, evolving fertility preferences, shifts in sexual activity outside of marriage and increased utilization of contraceptives in shaping the contraceptive market of 2040. Results show that there is not one global market, but distinct markets that vary in size and shape across the world. This diversity suggests that a range of different new CTs could have potential for uptake."

Macharia,Roseline Ochieng,Guohai Zhou,Dustin Dunsmuir,Walter Karlen,J. Mark Ansermino",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,69,587,"Heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) can be challenging to measure accurately and reliably in neonates. The introduction of innovative, non-invasive measurement technologies suitable for resource-constrained settings is limited by the lack of appropriate clinical thresholds for accuracy comparison studies.   We collected measurements of photoplethysmography-recorded HR and capnography-recorded exhaled carbon dioxide across multiple 60-second epochs (observations) in enrolled neonates admitted to the neonatal care unit at Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Trained study nurses manually recorded HR, and the study team manually counted individual breaths from capnograms. For comparison, HR and RR also were measured using an automated signal detection algorithm. Clinical measurements were analyzed for repeatability.   A total of 297 epochs across 35 neonates were recorded. Manual HR showed a bias of -2.4 (-1.8%) and a spread between the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of 40.3 (29.6%) compared to the algorithm-derived median HR. Manual RR showed a bias of -3.2 (-6.6%) and a spread between the 95% LOA of 17.9 (37.3%) compared to the algorithm-derived median RR, and a bias of -0.5 (1.1%) and a spread between the 95% LOA of 4.4 (9.1%) compared to the algorithm-derived RR count. Manual HR and RR showed repeatability of 0.6 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-0.7), and 0.7 (IQR 0.5-0.8), respectively.   Appropriate clinical thresholds should be selected   when performing accuracy comparisons for HR and RR. Automated measurement technologies typically use a smoothing or averaging filter, which significantly impacts accuracy. A wider spread between the LOA, as much as 30%, should be considered to account for the observed physiological nuances and within- and between-neonate variability and different averaging methods. Wider adoption of thresholds by data standards organizations and technology developers and manufacturers will increase the robustness of clinical comparison studies."

Substance use amongst adolescents is increasing in South Africa, and limited research on frequency, risk and protective factors means that prevention interventions are difficult to design. This paper aims to describe and discuss factors associated with substance use among school-going adolescents in three peri-urban South African settings.   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using baseline data from participants in the Girls Achieve Power (GAP Year) trial. Grade 8 learners (N=2383), aged 11-18, were recruited from 26 lowest quintile public high schools in three townships: Soweto and Thembisa in Gauteng Province, and Khayelitsha in Western Cape Province. A baseline survey gathered demographic and behavioural data. Questions relevant to substance use and social support were used for this analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with substance use. The final variables were included in an unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression for current substance use, and a multinomial logistic regression for frequency of substance use.    A total of 22.5% (534) of participants indicated they had ever used substances. Being male was strongly associated with substance use (P<0.001), and less strongly with frequency of substance use. Age significantly predicted substance use, with older adolescents being more likely to engage in substance use (P<0.001); having a parent/guardian employed was negatively associated with substance use (P=0.021). Family-related social support variables were predictive of substance use. Being able to count on friends when things went wrong was predictive of lower frequency of substance use (P=0.019).    These results can inform the targeting of prevention interventions to males and younger learners, as well as ensuring youth interventions build family and peer support to make substance use less likely and less frequent."

This study aims to estimate the proportion of married women living with their mothers-in-law across countries and time.     Using household rosters from 250 Demographic and Health Surveys in 75 countries, this paper uses the “relationship to head of household” question to identify households where married women live with their mothers-in-law.  For select countries with large changes, we decompose changes in rates into changes in the age structure of married women and the rate of women living with their mothers-in-law by age.    This paper finds large variation in family structure around the globe, from 1% of married women in Rwanda to 49% in Tajikistan living with their mother-in-law.  Many countries with high co-residence in the 1990s continue to see high and increasing numbers today, especially in Central and Southern Asia, while some North and sub-Saharan African countries experienced substantial declines.  Decomposing changes by age and rates shows that changes in the age structure of married women is not driving changes in co-residence, but rather the rates are changing across age groups.     These findings show the large variation in women living with their mothers-in-law across the globe.  The authors provide publicly available code and future research ideas to encourage others to further our understanding of the impact of living with her mother-in-law on a woman’s life."

Concomitant administration of certain medications can result in contraceptive failure, and consequently unintended pregnancies due to drug–drug interactions (DDIs). The objective of this analysis was to estimate the economic impact of unintended pregnancies due to DDIs among women of reproductive age using an OC alone or in combination with an enzyme inducer co-medication in the USA from a payer perspective.   A Markov model using a cohort of 1,000 reproductive-age women was developed to estimate costs due to contraceptive failure for OC alone   OC with concomitant enzyme inducer drugs. All women were assumed to begin an initial state, continuing until experiencing an unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancies could result in birth, induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, or ectopic pregnancy. The cohort was analyzed over a time horizon of 1 year with a cycle length of 1 month. Estimates of costs and probabilities of unintended pregnancy outcomes were obtained from the literature. Probabilities from the Markov cohort trace was used to estimate number of pregnancy outcomes.    On average, enzyme inducers resulted in 20 additional unintended pregnancies with additional unadjusted and adjusted costs median (range) of USD136,304 (USD57,436–USD320,093) and USD65,146 (USD28,491–USD162,635), respectively. The major component of the direct cost is attributed to the cost of births. Considering the full range of events, DDIs with enzyme inducers could result in 16–25 additional unintended pregnancies and total unadjusted and adjusted costs ranging between USD46,041 to USD399,121 and USD22,839 to USD202,788 respectively.   The direct costs associated with unintended pregnancies due to DDIs may be substantial and are potentially avoidable. Greater awareness of DDI risk with oral contraceptives among payers, physicians, pharmacists and patients may reduce unintended pregnancies in at-risk populations."

In Kenya, HIV incidence remains high among youth (15–24 years), with women disproportionately affected. Morbidity and mortality are compounded by a high rate of early and unwanted pregnancies. Existing prevention efforts to reduce youth vulnerabilities overwhelmingly focus on HIV alone, with limited efforts made to address concurrent factors that increase vulnerability of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) to HIV infection and unplanned pregnancies. Jilinde, is a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded large-scale project that supports the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Kenya. This manuscript presents a protocol for a study that seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive package of user-centered interventions to optimize uptake of HIV and pregnancy prevention services among AGYW in four Kenyan counties.    The study employed a concurrent mixed-methods design including two parallel before and after population-based cross-sectional surveys, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Study participants included 1,280 AGYW, 1,080 individuals from the general population, 80 health service providers, and 32 county health managers. The study involved a formative, implementation phase and endline assessment. Survey data was collected using Research Electronic Data Capture and analyzed using regression modelling while adjusting for confounders.  Qualitative data will be analyzed using grounded theory techniques using NVivo 12.0.    This study will uncover useful insights on the effectiveness of user-centered interventions in increasing concurrent utilization of blended HIV and pregnancy prevention interventions in a routine low resource setting. The findings will be disseminated through technical briefs, manuscripts, conferences, and workshops. The consolidated evidence could inform the scale-up of integrated HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health interventions targeting AGYW."

This paper presents a use case analysis of the routine data used by national NTD programs targeting lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and trachoma.    The use cases were developed through a combination of secondary and primary research focused on both global trends and deep dives into Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Results were refined through a stakeholder convening and the final eight use cases were determined through iteration and prioritization with stakeholders.    Eight use cases were developed: improve treatment register data quality, strengthen supervision of drug distributors during mass drug administration (MDA), generate accurate community-level population data for MDAs, create and manage an accurate inventory of drugs, meet district coverage targets during MDA campaigns, feedback and performance to sub-district teams, feedback on performance to sub-national teams, and national-level program use of data for evaluation and decision making. Each use case identifies key actors and their data-related needs and critical challenges, defines the current and desired state, and articulates the profile of a solution (digital and non-digital) needed to complete the use case.    The systematic strengthening of data use for decision-making in NTD programs is key for reaching the 2030 Roadmap goals. Integrated together, the presented use cases, when translated into action using appropriate and innovative solutions, can help to ensure that accurate and timely data are present at every step of a program and empower countries to use these data to make program decisions."

Coelho",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,94,795,"Ensuring the delivery and availability of health products, including temperature-sensitive vaccines, is vital to saving lives in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  In many LMICs routes are hand drawn by logisticians and are adjusted based on vehicle availability and product quantities. Easy-to-use real-time supply chain tools are needed to create or adjust routes for available vehicles and road conditions. Having more efficient and optimized distribution is especially critical for COVID-19 vaccine distribution.    Route Optimization Tool (RoOT) works best for planning routes for 50 health facilities or less, in two minutes. We develop RoOT using a variant of a Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Algorithm (VeRSA) that is coded in Python but reads and writes Excel files to make data input and using outputs easier. RoOT can be used for routine operations or in emergency situations, such as delivery of new COVID-19 vaccine. The tool has a user-centric design with easy dropdown menus and the ability to optimize on time, risk, or combination of both. RoOT is an open-source tool for optimal routing of health products. It provides optimized routes faster than most commercial software and is tailored to meet the needs of government stakeholders    We trained supply chain logisticians in Mozambique on using RoOT, and their feedback validates that RoOT is a practical tool to improve planning and efficient distribution of health products, especially vaccines. We also illustrate how  RoOT can be adapted for an emergency situation by using a test scenario of a cyclone. Currently, RoOT does not allow multi-day routes, and is designed for trips that can be completed within twenty-four hours. Areas for future development include multi-day routing and integration with mapping software to facilitate distance calculations and visualization of routes."

Multiple repurposed drugs have shown promise in treating COVID-19. We describe a master protocol that will assess the efficacy of different repurposed drugs as treatments for early COVID-19 among outpatients at a high risk for severe complications.   The TOGETHER Trial is a multi-center platform adaptive randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Patients are included if they are at least 18 years of age, have a positive antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and have an indication for high risk of disease severity, including co-morbidities, older age, or high body mass index. Eligible patients are randomized with equal chance to an investigational product (IP) or to placebo.The primary endpoint is hospitalization defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting for greater than 6 hours or transfer to tertiary hospital due to COVID-19. Secondary outcomes include mortality, adverse events, adherence, and viral clearance. Scheduled interim analyses are conducted and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), who make recommendations on continuing or stopping each IP. The platform adaptive design go-no-go decision rules are extended to dynamically incorporate external evidence on COVID-19 interventions from ongoing independent randomized clinical trials.   Results from this trial will assist in the identification of therapeutics for the treatment of early diagnosed COVID-19. The novel methodological extension of the platform adaptive design to dynamically incorporate external evidence is one of the first of its kind and may provide highly valuable information for all COVID-19 trials going forward.

Tsui",,24,276,"Withdrawal dominates the contraceptive method mix in a geographical cluster of countries in South-Eastern Europe and Western Asia that have, in part, reached low fertility. This study examines the socio-demographic determinants associated with withdrawal use in Armenia, Albania, Jordan and Turkey that could explain withdrawal’s persistence and inform contraceptive programs in these unique settings.     Cross-sectional data on 31,569 married women 15 to 49 years were drawn from the Demographic and Health Surveys in Albania (2017-2018), Armenia (2015-2016), Jordan (2017-2018), and Turkey (2013). For each country, multinomial regression models estimating withdrawal use among all women and logistic regression models estimating withdrawal use among contraceptive users were used to evaluate the association with age, marital duration, parity, education, residence, and household wealth.     The socio-demographic determinants associated with withdrawal use varied by country among all women and among all contraceptive users. While these associations were not all significant for all four countries general trends included that women were more likely to use withdrawal than not use contraception, but less likely to use withdrawal than other methods with increasing parity, higher education, and greater household wealth. Measures of association are reported by country for each correlate.     Despite the similar contraceptive mix in these four countries, no single set of factors was found to explain withdrawal’s persistence. Withdrawal’s prevalence in this geographical cluster may instead result from different balances of intertwined circumstances that include couples’ fertility decisions, access to modern contraception and availability of abortion services."

Coulman,James C. Birchall",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,99,977,"It is estimated that 225 million women worldwide have an unmet need for family planning, and more than half live in low- and middle-income countries. Increasing the choice of contraceptive methods available can reduce this unmet need. Microneedle drug delivery systems represent a new technology for minimally invasive self-administration of contraceptives. We explored stakeholders’ views on different aspects of a proposed microneedle-based hormonal contraceptive delivery system. The feedback was used to iteratively develop this delivery system.    Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted with potential stakeholders (women and trans males of childbearing age, their partners, and health professionals and organisations that provide family planning advice and contraception services) in Uganda, The Gambia, Malawi, and the UK, exploring concept acceptability and gathering feedback on different aspects of design and usability of the proposed delivery system.    Participants viewed the concept of a new, microneedle-based contraceptive favourably. In Uganda, participants were presented with 7 different prototype applicators and identified desirable features of a preferred delivery device; their input reducing the number of prototypes that were subsequently evaluated by stakeholders in The Gambia and the UK. Participants in these countries helped to identify and/or confirm the most desirable characteristics of the applicator, resulting in design consolidation into a refined concept applicator. The final, optimised applicator prototype was validated during user research in Malawi. This human-centred design approach was also used to iteratively develop an information leaflet for the device. During these user studies, other preferred aspects of a contraceptive delivery system were also evaluated, such as anatomical site of application, duration of action, and return to fertility.    A new microneedle-based contraceptive delivery system was iteratively developed using a human-centred design approach and was favourably received by potential stakeholders. The product is now being refined for testing in pre-clinical studies."

If integrated into an electronic medical records (EMR) system, it would provide a patient identification solution that replaces unreliable paper, under-five card (UFC), or number-based identifiers. This study aims to understand the relative advantage of the biometric system, the sociocultural and pragmatic compatibility, and the extent of UFC deterioration over time.    Interviews on impressions of the novel biometric patient identification tool were conducted in urban and rural settings in Zambia. Focus group discussions included 59 participants and key informant interviews included 5 healthcare workers and 2 government officials. Transcripts were coded into thematic categories for analysis. We sought to understand 1) the perceived relative advantage of a biometric system over the traditional UFCs among Zambian mothers, 2) the perceived sociocultural compatibility of a biometric system in the healthcare setting, and 3) pragmatic compatibility of the proposed system.    We found that the current UFC system presents issues for continuity of care and quality of data management, therefore posing disadvantages relative to the proposed system. Sociocultural and pragmatic barriers to acceptance included the existing fear of Satanism and electrical power issues throughout Zambia. Mothers and healthcare workers expressed that adoption of the biometric system could be successful given efforts to sensitize the community.    Switching to an EMR backed by biometric identification would fill a critical gap in Zambian healthcare information systems and has numerous perceived advantages in both urban and rural settings. We determine that strategies for implementation should be localized, context informed, and conducted by trusted community members with knowledge of best approaches to diffusing information and a deep understanding of the novel biometric system."

Third, we explore proximate determinants and other influences on fertility and changes in contraception, examining the changes in the method mix and unmet need; marriage patterns, including the demographics of the married population, spousal separation, and time since last sex; postpartum insusceptibility; infecundity, both primary and secondary; and abortion, to see if any have shifted significantly enough to allow for fertility to decline with less contraceptive use.   We find that the decline in fertility in Jordan was driven by a reduction in mistimed or unwanted pregnancies and there was a significant increase in the share of reproductive aged women who are infecund. We also concluded that the changes in fertility and contraceptive use are driven by changes in Jordanian nationals, not by the growing Syrian refugee population.    Jordan is not the only country to be experiencing a shift in the typical relationship between CPR and TFR.  Results can inform both future approaches for family planning programs and our expectations regarding what kind of change our family planning investments might buy."

Final models were internally validated in an independent sample of Canadian infants, and externally validated in infant cohorts from the Philippines and China.     Cohorts included 39,666 infants from Canada, 82,909 from the Philippines and 4,448 from China.  For the full model including sex, birth weight and metabolomic markers, GA estimates were within ±5 days of ultrasound values in the Canadian internal validation (mean absolute error (MAE) 0.71, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.72), and within ±6 days of ultrasound GA in both the Filipino (0.90 (0.90, 0.91)) and Chinese cohorts (0.89 (0.86, 0.92)). Despite the decreased accuracy in external settings, our models incorporating metabolomic markers performed better than the baseline model, which relied on sex and birth weight alone. In preterm and growth-restricted infants, the accuracy of metabolomic models was markedly higher than the baseline model.    Accuracy of metabolic GA algorithms was attenuated when applied in external settings.  Models including metabolomic markers demonstrated higher accuracy than models using sex and birth weight alone. As innovators look to take this work to scale, further investigation of modeling and data normalization techniques will be needed to improve robustness and generalizability of metabolomic GA estimates in low resource settings, where this could have the most clinical utility"

We identified 373,032 polymerase chase reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 cases in the Cerner Labs database between 01-MAR-2020 and 31-DEC-2020 and identified patients that had received measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) or a recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine within the previous 5 years. We calculated heterogeneity scores to support interpretation of results across institutions, and used stepwise forward variable selection to construct covariable-based propensity scores. These scores were used to match cases and control for biasing and confounding issues inherent in observational data.   Neither the recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine nor MMR showed significant efficacy in prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We could not derive clinically significant results on the impact of MMR for case fatality rates due to persistently high rates of heterogeneity between institutions. However, we were able to achieve acceptable levels of heterogeneity for the analysis of the recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine, and found a clinically meaningful benefit of reduced case fatality rate, with an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38 – 0.48).   Using propensity score matching and heterogeneity statistics can help guide our interpretation of real-world data, and rigorous statistical methods are needed to reduce bias or disparities in data interpretation. Applying these methods to the impact of viral vaccines on COVID-19 case fatalities yields actionable findings for further analysis."

Cross-sectional serological studies including multiple pathogens offer a crucial insight into this problem.    We use data from three cross-sectional serological surveys (in 2003, 2007 and 2013) in a Baltimore emergency department to predict the prevalence for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV2), in a fourth survey (in 2016). We develop a mathematical model to make this prediction and to estimate the incidence of infection and coinfection in each age and ethnic group in each year.   Overall we find a much stronger age cohort effect than a time effect, so that, while incidence at a given age may decrease over time, individuals born at similar times experience a more constant force of infection over time.   These results emphasise the importance of age-cohort counselling and early intervention while people are young. Our approach adds value to data such as these by providing age- and time-specific incidence estimates which could not be obtained any other way, and allows forecasting to enable future public health planning."

Lawn",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,146,1079,"Sepsis and meningitis due to invasive group B   (iGBS) disease during early infancy is a leading cause of child mortality. Recent systematic estimates of the worldwide burden of GBS suggested that there are 319,000 cases of infant iGBS disease each year, and an estimated 147,000 stillbirths and young-infant deaths, with the highest burden occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The following priority data gaps were highlighted: (1) long-term outcome data after infant iGBS, including mild disability, to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and (2) economic burden for iGBS survivors and their families. Geographic data gaps were also noted with few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), where the GBS burden is estimated to be the highest. In this paper we present the protocol for a multi-country matched cohort study designed to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), socioemotional behaviors, and economic outcomes for children who survive invasive GBS disease in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Children will be identified from health demographic surveillance systems, hospital records, and among participants of previous epidemiological studies. The children will be aged between 18 months to 17 years. A tablet-based custom-designed application will be used to capture data from direct assessment of the child and interviews with the main caregiver. In addition, a parallel sub-study will prospectively measure the acute costs of hospitalization due to neonatal sepsis or meningitis, irrespective of underlying etiology. In summary, these data are necessary to characterize the consequences of iGBS disease and enable the advancement of effective strategies for survivors to reach their developmental and economic potential. In particular, our study will inform the development of a full public health value proposition on maternal GBS immunization that is being coordinated by the World Health Organization."

This study seeks to evaluate if cloth masks have increased efficiency with the addition of a filter material.   An adult airway and test lung model were exposed to nebulized ‘coarse’ aerosol droplets (0.5-11 µm) and humidified ‘fine’ water vapor particles (0.03-0.05 µm). Aerosol was quantified based on particles deposited on the face, airway and lung model. Tracheal humidity levels characterized fine particle permeability. Both phases of testing were conducted by evaluating the following testing conditions: 1) no mask; 2) cloth mask; 3) cloth mask with Swiffer™ filter; 4) cloth mask with Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 15 filter; 4) cloth mask with PM2.5 filter 5) surgical mask and 6) N95 respirator.    All mask conditions provided greater filtration from coarse particles when compared to no mask (P<0.05). All cloth mask with filter combinations were better at stopping fine particles in comparison to no mask. A cloth mask without a filter and surgical mask performed similarly to no mask with fine particles (P<0.05). The cloth mask with MERV 15 filter and the surgical mask performed similarly to the N95 with course particles, while the cloth mask with Swiffer™ performed similarly to the N95 with the fine particles (P<0.05).   Respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are spread through exposure to respiratory secretions that are aerosolized by infected individuals. The findings from this study suggest that a mask can filter these potentially infectious airborne particles."

Initiatives for national rollout are few, and subtle skepticism persists in several countries about the feasibility of national PrEP implementation. We describe the conceptual design of the   project, which is implementing oral PrEP as a routine service at a public health scale in Kenya. We describe the overlapping domains of supply, demand, and government and community ownership, which combine to produce a learning laboratory environment to explore the scale-up of PrEP.

We describe the “learning laboratory” approach that informs strategic and continuous learning, which allows for adjustments to the project.   conceptual model illustrates how the coalescence of these concepts can promote scale-up of PrEP in real-world conditions and offers critical lessons on an implementation model for scaling up oral PrEP in low- and middle-income countries."

The first of RTA’s two phases involved multiple design research activities, such as human-centered design and co-creation, while the second phase focused on secondary analysis of interviews and reports from the design research. This paper explores the limitations of current technical assistance (TA) approaches and maps opportunities to improve how TA is planned and delivered in the health sector.    We analyzed project reports and 68 interviews with TA funders, providers, and consumers to explore in greater detail their perspectives on TA, its characteristics and drawbacks as well as opportunities for improvement. We used qualitative content analysis techniques for this study.      The issues surrounding TA included the focus on donor-driven agendas over country priorities, poor accountability between and within TA actors, inadequate skill transfer from TA providers to government TA consumers, an emphasis on quick fixes and short-term thinking, and inadequate governance mechanisms to oversee and manage TA. Consequently, health systems do not achieve the highest levels of resilience and autonomy.    Participants in project workshops and interviews called for a transformation in TA centered on a redistribution of power enabling governments to establish their health agendas in keeping with the issues that are of greatest importance to them, followed by collaboration with donors to develop TA interventions. Recommended improvements to the TA landscape in this paper include nine critical shifts, four domains of change, and 20 new guiding principles."

This research aimed to determine growth of infants from birth to two months (around age of vaccination) and the mortality risk of underweight LBW infants compared to normal birth weight (NBW) infants at two and six months age.   A secondary analysis of a birth cohort of 1103 infants in Burkina Faso was conducted. Anthropometry was performed monthly from 0 to 12 months. We assessed associations with mortality using Cox proportional hazards models and assessed discriminatory values using area under receiver operating characteristics curves.   Eighty-six (7.8%) children died by age one year, 26/86 (30%) and 51/86 (59%) within two and six months, respectively. At age two months, weight gain since birth did not better discriminate mortality risk than current weight-for-age (P=0.72) or mid-upper arm circumference (P=0.21). In total, 227 (21%) LBW infants had increased risk of mortality: adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) 3.30 (95%CI 2.09 to 4.90).  Among infants who were underweight at two and six months, LBW infants (64% and 49%, respectively) were not at reduced risk of death compared to NBW infants (aHR 2.63 (95%CI 0.76 to 9.15) and 2.43 (95%CI 0.74 to 7.98), respectively).   Assessing weight gain since birth does not offer advantages over immediate anthropometry for discriminating mortality risk. LBW infants who are later identified as underweight require care to help prevent mortality."

Due to its multi-functionality, assessing the placenta can provide critical information about maternal and child health and risks of adverse outcomes.    We aimed to quantify the percentage of human pregnancy studies that include placenta data.    We conducted a rapid review of pregnancy studies conducted in the US that were published as original research in PubMed in 2018. Human studies conducted during the second trimester, third trimester, or labor and/or delivery were eligible. The systematic search produced 1,448 publications. After screening and full article review, 290 studies met all eligibility criteria. We then extracted data on study design, reporting of placenta data, time and type of data collection, and study objective categorization.    In total, 32% of studies were randomized controlled trials; the remaining were observational studies. Only 14% included placenta data of any kind. A total of 10% included placenta data during pregnancy and 7% included data after delivery; only 2% included both. Most data during pregnancy were collected by ultrasound and most data on the delivered placenta were from pathology exams. Study objectives were focused on maternal and/or infant outcomes (99.7%), while only one study had a placenta outcome.    Based on this rapid review, a small proportion of pregnancy studies use placenta data in research. The placenta, an essential component of understanding healthy or adverse outcomes, deserves much more attention in pregnancy research."

Current targets to achieve elimination were set to 2020 but are being extended to 2030. Mathematical and statistical models suggest that 2030 is a realistic timeline for elimination as a public health problem in most trachoma endemic areas. Although the goal can be achieved, it is important to develop appropriate monitoring tools for surveillance after having achieved the elimination target to check for the possibility of resurgence. For this purpose, a standardized serological approach or the use of multiple diagnostics in complement would likely be required."

This study was conducted in 2019 in the FHD to assess tetanus vaccine coverage among mothers for their last pregnancy and the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered to the mothers.   This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in the FHD in 2019. Mothers living in the district with at least one child younger than five years were included and were selected by random stratified cluster sampling. Trained surveyors used a face-to-face questionnaire, data extraction grid and data-tracking grid to review and collect data from antenatal care booklets, vaccination cards and the women’s own reports of immunization. The immunization coverage per vaccine dose and vaccination completeness rate were estimated.    From 621 women visited, 602 (96.9%) responded. A total of 176/511 women (34.4%) had evidence of vaccination. For the last pregnancy, the two-dose immunization proportion was 21.7% (111/511) for documented coverage and 47.6% (243/511) for undocumented coverage. 306/570 women (53.7%) had received more than the recommended five doses necessary for lifetime protection.

Domestically based and locally owned funding models provide alternative financing solutions. 2)   Various populations still face challenges in accessing FP. Youth-inclusive and user-centered programming show promise in addressing such challenges. 3)  Unsafe abortions tend to be more common among younger, poor, uneducated and rural women. Legislation is still needed to facilitate a culture of safe abortions. 4)  Couples who share equitable responsibility in decision-making processes are more likely to use contraceptives; couple disagreement influences women’s decisions to covertly use FP. 5)  Male champions can successfully promote uptake of FP. Gender-transformative programming promotes gender equity and impacts behavior change. 6)   Recent advances include user-centered contraceptive technologies that allow for self-administration and information systems which optimize supply chain management.

We propose a framework, adapted from the CoP model developed by Etienne Wenger, for systematically understanding the stages a CoP may go through as it develops its capacity to identify and solve problems and implement good practices. Our framework is based on the experience of practitioners of the LISTEN model (Local Initiatives Scaled Through Enterprise Networks) in eight local-level CoPs in Kenya and Eswatini. LISTEN seeks to help CoPs integrate continuous improvement processes, data, and human-centered design into their development and solutioning activities. The four stages in our framework for a CoP’s problem-solving journey are: 1)   Identify and understand the CoP’s purpose and goals, and build rapport with its members and leaders; 2)   Use a process of human-centered design to obtain a rapid and clear success in addressing a problem that the CoP has identified for itself and which it can tackle with its own resources; 3)   Support the CoP in addressing more complex or long-term issues, including links to other CoPs at the local-community or higher levels to disseminate knowledge and obtain resources and support, where needed; and 4)   Support the CoP as it transitions into potentially new structures or functions. For each stage of the framework, we describe the kinds of support that may be provided to the CoP in the LISTEN model, and the types of tools that could be developed to assist them in problem-solving and in disseminating sustainable solutions."

While many literature sources and guidance point to the inadequacy of individual informed consent for any genetically modified mosquito release, including gene drive ones, (outside of epidemiological studies that might require blood samples) and at the need for a community-level decision, researchers often find themselves with no specific guidance on how that decision should be made, expressed and by whom. Target Malaria, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Pan African Mosquito Control Association co-organised a workshop with researchers and practitioners on this topic to question the model proposed by Target Malaria in its research so far that involved the release of genetically modified sterile male mosquitoes and how this could be adapted to future studies involving gene drive mosquito releases for them to offer reflections about potential best practices. This paper shares the outcomes of that workshop and highlights the remaining topics for discussion before a comprehensive model can be designed."

Peters",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,74,583,"Livestock mortality impacts farmer livelihoods and household nutrition. Capturing trends in livestock mortality at localised or national levels is essential to planning, monitoring and evaluating interventions and programs aimed at decreasing mortality rates. However, livestock mortality data is disparate, and indicators used have not been standardised. This review aims to assess livestock mortality indicator definitions reported in literature, and define the ages where mortality has greatest impact.    A systematic review was conducted, limited to articles focussed on mortality of cattle, sheep and goats. Peer-reviewed articles in Web of Science until year 2020 were assessed for inclusion of age-based definitions for mortality indicators and data on age distribution of mortality. Indicator definitions for each species were collated and similar terms and age groups most targeted were compared. The cumulative distribution of age at mortality was compared across studies graphically where possible; otherwise, age patterns for mortality were collated.    Most studies reported mortality risk rather than rate, and there was little agreement between indicator definitions used in the literature. The most common indicators reported were perinatal and neonatal mortality in cattle, and for perinatal, neonatal and pre-weaning mortality indicators for sheep and goats. Direct comparison of age distribution of mortality was only possible for cattle, which found that approximately 80% of all mortalities within the first 12 months had occurred by six months of age. A significant finding of the study is the variation in age groups for which mortality is reported, which impedes the comparison of mortality risk across studies, particularly for sheep and goats.    This study demonstrates the importance and value of standardising mortality risk indicators for general use, including a young stock mortality risk indicator measuring mortality in the highest risk period of birth to six months of age in cattle, sheep and goats."

Chaves,Nancy A. Otieno,Marc-Alain Widdowson,Jennifer Verani,Paula Frew,Andrew Wilson,Saad B. Omer,Fauzia Malik",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,66,691,"Maternal immunization is known to be one of the best strategies to protect both mothers and their infants from infectious diseases. Studies have shown that healthcare providers play a critical role in implementation of maternal immunization. However, little is known about providers’ attitudes and beliefs towards vaccination that can influence their vaccine recommendations, specifically in low to middle income countries (LMIC).   A self-administrated knowledge, attitude and behavior (KAB) survey was provided to 150 antenatal care providers across four different regions (Nairobi, Mombasa, Marsabit, and Siaya counties) of Kenya. The research staff visited the 150 clinics and hospitals and distributed a quantitative KAB survey.   Nearly all of the antenatal care providers (99%) recommended tetanus maternal vaccination. Similarly, 99% of the providers agreed that they would agree to provide additional vaccinations for pregnant women and reported that they always advise their patients to get vaccinated. Between 80 and 90% of the providers reported that religious beliefs, ethnicity, cultural background and political leaders do not affect their attitude or beliefs towards recommending vaccines.   Considering the positive responses of healthcare providers towards vaccine acceptance and recommendation, these results highlight an opportunity to work in partnership with these providers to improve coverage of maternal vaccination and to introduce additional vaccines (such as influenza). In order to achieve this, logistical barriers that have affected the coverage of the currently recommended vaccines, should be addressed as part of this partnership."

To understand contextual challenges in care pathways, we explored patterns in care-seeking amongst children who died of pneumonia in Malawi.     We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of verbal autopsies (VA) amongst deaths in children aged 1-59 months from 10/2011 to 06/2016 in Mchinji district, Malawi. Suspected pneumonia deaths were defined as: 1. caregiver reported cough and fast breathing in the 2-weeks prior to death; or, 2. the caregiver specifically stated the child died of pneumonia; or 3. cause of death assigned as ‘acute respiratory infection’ using InterVA-4. Data were extracted from free-text narratives based on domains in the ‘Pathways to Survival’ framework, and described using proportions. Qualitative analysis used a framework approach, with pre-specified themes.      We analysed 171 suspected pneumonia deaths. In total, 86% of children were taken to a healthcare facility during their final illness episode, and 44% sought care more than once.  Of children who went to hospital (n=119), 70% were admitted, and 25% received oxygen. Half of the children died within a healthcare setting (43% hospital, 5% health centre and 2% private clinics), 64 (37%) at home, and 22 (13%) in transit. Challenges in delayed care, transport and quality of care (including oxygen), were reported.      Healthcare was frequently sought for children who died of suspected pneumonia, however several missed opportunities for care were seen. Sustained investment in timely appropriate care seeking, quick transportation to hospital and improved case management at all levels of the system is needed."

Weinberger",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,60,803,"In 2017, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced into the Indian immunization program as a priority. However, monitoring the implementation of this program has been a major challenge in rural India. Novel digital health platforms, used to track vaccine delivery, can address this issue.   : We analyzed data collected in a rural part of the Udaipur District of India, which recently introduced PCV13 into the routine immunization program. The data were collected by Khushi Baby, a novel technology platform which facilitates tracking the vaccination status of individual children. We assessed the percent of children receiving 1, 2, or 3 doses of the vaccine at different ages and time points, as well as geographic variations in uptake. Only doses received before 12 months of age were considered for this analysis.    More than 96% of children captured by the database received the first dose of PCV13. Uptake of the second dose ranged from 69% to 90% across the five regions, and 44% to 76% of children received the third (booster) dose within 3 months of the recommended date.   These data provide early evidence that the primary doses of PCV13 are being administered at a high level in rural India; however, there is considerable variability between regions. Additionally, the receipt of the booster dose may be lower than desired. Given the importance of the booster dose in reducing pneumococcal transmission, its delivery is essential to ensure maximal benefit of the vaccine program."

Few programs have systematically utilized all contacts a woman and her baby have with the health system, from pregnancy through the first year postpartum, to promote PPFP. Nested into a larger study covering two districts, this study assessed the use, acceptability, and feasibility of tools for tracking women’s decision-making and use of PPFP in the community health system in Oromia region, Ethiopia. Community-level tracking tools included a modified Integrated Maternal and Child Health (IMCH) card with new PPFP content, and a newly developed tool for pregnant and postpartum women for use by Women Development Armies (WDAs). Proper completion of the tools was monitored during supervision visits.   In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with health officials, health extension workers, and volunteers. A total of 34 audio-files were transcribed and translated into English, double-coded using MAXQDA, and analyzed using a thematic approach.   The results describe how HEWs used the modified IMCH card to track women’s decision making through the continuum of care, to assess pregnancy risk and to strengthen client-provider interaction. Supervision data demonstrated how well HEWs completed the modified IMCH card. The WDA tool was intended to promote PPFP and encourage multiple contacts with facilities from pregnancy to extended postpartum period. HEWs have reservations about the engagement of WDAs and their use of the WDA tool.   To conclude, the IMCH card improves counseling practices through the continuum of care and is acceptable and feasible to apply. Some elements have been incorporated into a revised national tool and can serve as example for other low-income countries with similar community health systems. Further study is warranted to determine how to engage WDAs in promoting PPFP."

In low-income settings, where a significant proportion of deaths take place at home or in poorly-resourced peripheral health facilities, data on CoD often relies on verbal autopsies (VAs). Validations of VAs have been performed against clinical diagnosis, but never before against an acceptable gold standard: the complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA).   We have validated a computer-coded verbal autopsy method –the InterVA- using individual and population metrics to determine CoD against the CDA, in 316 deceased patients of different age groups who died in a tertiary-level hospital in Maputo, Mozambique between 2013 and 2015.    We found a low agreement of the model across all age groups at the individual (kappa statistic ranging from -0.030 to 0.232, lowest in stillbirths and highest in adults) and population levels (chance-corrected cause-specific mortality fraction accuracy ranging from -1.00 to 0.62, lowest in stillbirths, highest in children). The sensitivity in identifying infectious diseases was low (0% for tuberculosis, diarrhea, and disseminated infections, 32% for HIV-related infections, 33% for malaria and 36% for pneumonia). Of maternal deaths, 26 were assigned to eclampsia but only four patients actually died of eclampsia.   These findings do not lead to building confidence in current estimates of CoD. They also call to the need to implement autopsy methods where they may be feasible, and to improve the quality and performance of current VA techniques."

We contribute to implementation science by analyzing the implementation of an organizational change intervention in a large, hierarchical and bureaucratic public service in a LMIC health system.    Using qualitative methods, we critically interrogate the implementation of an intervention to improve quality of obstetric and newborn services across 692 facilities in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states of India to reveal how to go about making change happen in LMIC public health services.    We found that focusing the interventions on a discreet part of the health service (labour rooms) ensured minimal disruption of the status quo and created room for initiating change. Establishing and maintaining respectful, trusting relationships is critical, and it takes time and much effort to cultivate such relationships. Investing in doing so allows one to create a safe space for change; it helps thaw entrenched practices, behaviours and attitudes, thereby creating opportunities for change. Those at the frontline of change processes need to be enabled and supported to: lead by example, model and embody desirable behaviours, be empathetic and humble, and make the change process a positive and meaningful experience for all involved. They need discretionary space to tailor activities to local contexts and need support from higher levels of the organisation to exercise discretion.    We conclude that making change happen in LMIC public health services, is possible, and is best approached as a flexible, incremental, localised, learning process. Smaller change interventions targeting discreet parts of the public health services, if appropriately contextualised, can set the stage for incremental system wide changes and improvements to be initiated. To succeed, change initiatives need to cultivate and foster support across all levels of the organisation."

However, everyday life has been dramatically affected by highly restrictive government-imposed measures such as stay-at-home curfews, prohibitions on mobility across national and county boundaries, and strict policing, especially of the urban poor, which has culminated in violence. This open letter highlights the effects of these measures on how three community-based organizations (CBOs) deliver HIV programs and services to highly stigmatized communities of men who have sex with men living in the counties of Kisumu, Kiambu and Mombasa. In particular, emphasis is placed on how HIV testing programs, which are supported by systematic peer outreach, are being disrupted at a time when global policymakers call for expanded HIV testing and treatment targets among key populations. While COVID 19 measures have greatly undermined local efforts to deliver health services to members and strengthen existing HIV testing programs, each of the three CBOs has taken innovative steps to adapt to the restrictions and to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Although HIV testing in clinical spaces among those who were once regular and occasional program attendees dropped off noticeably in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdown, the program eventually began to rebound as outreach approaches shifted to virtual platforms and strategies. Importantly and unexpectedly, HIV self-testing kits proved to fill a major gap in clinic-based HIV testing at a time of crisis."

This research note analyses differences in contraceptive method mix across Sustainable Development Goal regions and applies assumed method-specific declines in use (from 0 per cent to 20 per cent) to produce an illustrative scenario of the potential impact of COVID-19 on contraceptive use and on the proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods. Globally, it had been estimated that 77 per cent of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) would have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods in 2020. However, taking into account the potential impact of COVID-19 on method-specific use, this could fall to 71 per cent, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. Overall declines in contraceptive use will depend on the methods used by women and their partners and on the types of disruptions experienced. The analysis concludes with the recommendation that countries should include family planning and reproductive health services in the package of essential services and develop strategies to ensure that women and couples are able to exercise their reproductive rights during the COVID-19 crisis."

Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, their use for health-care coupled with a biometric identification method, present a unique opportunity to address this challenge. Our research proposes an Android-based solution of an ear biometric tool for reliable identification. Unlike many popular biometric approaches (e.g., fingerprints, irises, facial recognition), ears are noninvasive and easily accessible on individuals across a lifespan. Our ear biometric tool uses a combination of hardware and software to identify a person using an image of their ear. The hardware supports an image capturing process that reduces undesired variability. The software uses a pattern recognition algorithm to transform an image of the ear into a unique identifier. We created three cross-sectional datasets of ear images, each increasing in complexity, with the final dataset representing our target use-case population of Zambian infants (N=224, aged 6days-6months). Using these datasets, we conducted a series of validation experiments, which informed iterative improvements to the system. Results of the improved system, which yielded high recognition rates across the three datasets, demonstrate the feasibility of an Android ear biometric tool as a solution to the persisting patient identification challenge."

As disease protection during the first six months of life is provided via placental transfer of maternal antibodies, a maternal GBS vaccine may provide an effective strategy to reduce infectious death and disability. An efficacy study may be difficult because of the large sample size required and alternative approaches such as serocorrelates of protection based on natural antibody concentration are being considered. Such studies would need to be undertaken in high burden settings such as Uganda. We therefore aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a GBS sero-epidemiology study in Kampala, Uganda.   : This is a prospective cohort and nested case-control study, conducted across two-centres with two entry points. A) consecutive women and their infants at birth, with collection of maternal swab, cord and maternal blood, and follow up by telephone until the infant is 3 months old; B) any infant under 3 months of age, presenting with signs of sepsis to any of the paediatric units, with collection of blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs. Any infants identified as having GBS disease (defined as GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) will be recruited and followed up for two years to assess their neurodevelopment. A nested qualitative study will investigate stakeholder (pregnant women and their families, healthcare workers and community leaders) opinions of sampling for such a study and understanding and potential uptake of vaccines in pregnancy.   : The primary aim is to determine anti-GBS antibody concentration in infants with GBS disease compared to healthy controls. Secondary outcomes include stillbirth and all-cause infection and acceptance of sample methods and vaccination. The findings will inform scalability and sustainability of the programme in Uganda."

We introduce stochastic differential equation (SDE) models into child growth research. SDEs describe flexible dynamic processes comprising: drift - gradual smooth changes – such as physiology or gut microbiome, and diffusion - sudden perturbations, such as illness or infection.   : We present a case study applying SDE models to child growth trajectory data from the Haydom, Tanzania and Venda, South Africa sites within the MAL-ED cohort. These data comprise n=460 children aged 0-24 months. A comparison with classical curve fitting (linear mixed models) is also presented.   : The SDE models offered a wide range of new flexible shapes and parameterizations compared to classical additive models, with performance as good or better than standard approaches. The predictions from the SDE models suggest distinct longitudinal clusters that form distinct ‘streams’ hidden by the large between-child variability.   : Using SDE models to predict future growth trajectories revealed new insights in the observed data, where trajectories appear to cluster together in bands, which may have a future risk assessment application. SDEs offer an attractive approach for child growth modelling and potentially offer new insights."

However, there is still much confusion about the meaning and uses of the CET, how it should be calculated, and what constitutes an adequate evidence base for its formulation. One widely referenced and used threshold in the last decade has been the 1-3 GDP per capita, which is often attributed to the Commission on Macroeconomics and  WHO guidelines on Choosing Interventions that are Cost Effective (WHO-CHOICE). For many reasons, however, this threshold has been widely criticised; which has led experts across the world, including the WHO, to discourage its use. This has left a vacuum for policy-makers and technical staff at a time when countries are wanting to move towards Universal Health Coverage    This article seeks to address this gap by offering five practical options for decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries that can be used instead of the 1-3 GDP rule, to combine existing evidence with fair decision-rules or develop locally relevant CETs.

Recently, social accountability programs have shown promising results in addressing barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services. As a highly complex participatory process with multiple and interrelated components, steps and actors, studying social accountability poses methodological challenges. The Community and Provider driven Social Accountability Intervention (CaPSAI) Project study protocol was developed to measure the impact of a social accountability intervention on contraceptive uptake and use and to understand the mechanisms and contextual factors that influence and generate these effects (with emphasis on health services actors and community members).   : CaPSAI Project is implementing a social accountability intervention where service users and providers assess the quality of local FP/C services and jointly identify ways to improve the delivery and quality of such services. In the project, a quasi-experimental study utilizing an interrupted time series design with a control group is conducted in eight intervention and eight control facilities in each study country, which are Ghana and Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey of service users and health care providers is used to measure social accountability outcomes, and a cohort of women who are new users of FP/C is followed up after the completion of the intervention to measure contraceptive use and continuation. The process evaluation utilizes a range of methods and data sources to enable a fuller description of how the findings were produced.   : This complex study design could provide researchers and implementers with the means to better measure and understand the mechanisms and contextual factors that influence social accountability processes in reproductive health, adding important findings to the evidence base."

However, the effectiveness of family planning is constrained by unmet needs. This study determined the proportion and identify factors associated with unmet family planning needs among women of childbearing age in The Gambia.    We utilized cross-sectional population-based Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Gambian women aged 15-49 years in 2013. The outcome measured was the total unmet/met need for FP.  The sample comprised 10,233 women aged 15-49 years old. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used.   Of the 10,233 eligible women recruited in the study, the mean age was 27.4±9.1 years while 67.5% were married. Overall, 17.6% of women reported unmet FP need, of whom 14.0% and 3.6% reported unmet birth spacing and birth limitation needs, respectively. The women's age, region, ethnicity, number of live children, number of household/family members, the optimal number of children, and husband/partners’ desire for the children were found as significant determinants of unmet FP needs. Furthermore, breastfeeding has been identified as the key reason for the non-use of FP in mothers.   The study findings suggest a need to expand FP programs and related strategic communications especially for younger women in order to improve their contraceptive prevalence.

Mirelman,James Love-Koh,Sangjun Kim,Rodrigo Moreno-Serra,Paul Revill,Mark Sculpher,Marc Suhrcke",,98,676,"Health impact evaluations (HIEs) are currently the main way of assessing policy changes in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, evidence on effectiveness alone cannot reliably inform decisions over the allocation of limited resources. Health economic evaluation provides a suitable framework for ‘value for money’ assessments.    In this article we explore to what extent economic evaluations have been conducted alongside published health impact evaluations, then we assess the quality of these, using criteria from an economic evaluation reference case developed for use in LMICs.    Among the 2419 HIEs stored in the International Initiative for Impact Evaluations (3ie) database, and among the 8155 studies identified by the Ovid Medline database search, only 70 studies included an economic evaluation. When measured against the quality assessment criteria, study quality showed great variation. Many studies did not fulfil the basic requirements for economic evaluation, such as stating the perspective of the budget holder, using generic health measures that can be compared across diseases, or suitably reflecting uncertainty.    Greater effort should be directed towards bringing the fields of impact evaluation and economic evaluation together to better inform resource allocation decisions in global health."

Over the last few years, the use of virtual platforms and internet sites to seek male sexual partners has increased manyfold in Kenya. New approaches are required to map, estimate and profile MSM who operate through virtual platforms to design interventions for them.    This study was conducted in three counties in Kenya: Kiambu, Kisumu and Mombasa with MSM who use virtual platforms such as geosocial networking (GSN) and social networking applications to find and connect with male sex partners. The platforms were profiled through a multi-stage approach and the number of MSM associated with these platforms were estimated. In the final stage, 435 respondents randomly selected from the virtual platforms were interviewed in a secure location after informed consent. Data analysis focused on calculating an estimate of MSM for each virtual platform in each site, adjusting for duplicate profiles and multiple registrations.    We identified 24 GSN apps, 18 Facebook accounts/pages and 18 WhatsApp groups across the three counties, with Facebook being the preferred platform. Kiambu had the highest number of estimated MSM at 3,635 (95%CI = 3,335 to 3,990) followed by Kisumu at 1,567 (95%CI = 1,480 to 1,665) and Mombasa at 1,469 (95%CI = 1,335 to 1,604) who used virtual platforms to find other male sexual partners. On average, each MSM had 3.7 profiles on multiple platforms, with an average of 2.1 profiles used in the past month.    The use of conventional population size estimation approaches that focus on physical sites alone may underestimate the total number of MSM in a geography. Virtual mapping should be used in conjunction with conventional hot spot based size estimation methodologies to estimate numbers of MSM to set programmatic targets."

Novel technologies for arboviruses control are being developed, such as the   method, implemented by the World Mosquito Program (WMP). Here we discuss and analyse the framework for community engagement implemented by the WMP in Brazil, during the large-scale deployment of the method in the municipalities of Niterói and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our experience indicates that the community engagement work for arboviruses control should be understood as an opportunity for local development. It is necessary, based on an integrated analysis of the territory, to understand that the actions for arboviruses control could be a catalyst for the necessary socioenvironmental, cultural and public health changes. Furthermore, it is essential to understand that community engagement goes beyond informing or asking for population consent, but it constitutes a possibility for dialogue and exchange between the various stakeholders present in the territories, to build on cooperation for mosquito-borne disease control."

Johnson",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,66,664,": South Africa began offering medical male circumcision (MMC) in 2010. We evaluated the current and future impact of this program to see if it is effective in preventing new HIV infections.   : The Thembisa, Goals and Epidemiological Modeling Software (EMOD) HIV transmission models were calibrated to South Africa’s HIV epidemic, fitting to household survey data on HIV prevalence, risk behaviors, and proportions of men circumcised, and to programmatic data on intervention roll-out including program-reported MMCs over 2009-2017. We compared the actual program accomplishments through 2017 and program targets through 2021 with a counterfactual scenario of no MMC program.   : The MMC program averted 71,000-83,000 new HIV infections from 2010 to 2017. The future benefit of the circumcision already conducted will grow to 496,000-518,000 infections (6-7% of all new infections) by 2030. If program targets are met by 2021 the benefits will increase to 723,000-760,000 infections averted by 2030. The cost would be $1,070-1,220 per infection averted relative to no MMC. The savings from averted treatment needs would become larger than the costs of the MMC program around 2034-2039.  In the Thembisa model, when modelling South Africa’s 9 provinces individually, the 9-provinces-aggregate results were similar to those of the single national model. Across provinces, projected long-term impacts were largest in Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga (23-27% reduction over 2017-2030), reflecting these provinces’ greater MMC scale-up.   : MMC has already had a modest impact on HIV incidence in South Africa and can substantially impact South Africa’s HIV epidemic in the coming years."

Reliable gestational age estimates are useful for quantifying population burdens of preterm birth and informing allocation of resources to address the problem. However, evaluating gestational age in low-resource settings can be challenging, particularly in places where access to ultrasound is limited. Our group has developed an algorithm using newborn screening analyte values derived from dried blood spots from newborns born in Ontario, Canada for estimating gestational age within one to two weeks. The primary objective of this study is to validate a program that derives gestational age estimates from dried blood spot samples (heel-prick or cord blood) collected from health and demographic surveillance sites and population representative health facilities in low-resource settings in Zambia, Kenya, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. We will also pilot the use of an algorithm to identify birth percentiles based on gestational age estimates and weight to identify small for gestational age infants. Once collected from local sites, samples will be tested by the Newborn Screening Ontario laboratory at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa, Canada. Analyte values will be obtained through laboratory analysis for estimation of gestational age as well as screening for other diseases routinely conducted at Ontario’s newborn screening program. For select conditions, abnormal screening results will be reported back to the sites in real time to facilitate counseling and future clinical management. We will determine the accuracy of our existing algorithm for estimation of gestational age in these newborn samples. Results from this research hold the potential to create a feasible method to assess gestational age at birth in low- and middle-income countries where reliable estimation may be otherwise unavailable."

Post Pregnancy Family Planning Choices, an operations research study, aims to examine the effectiveness of a package of postpregnancy FP interventions, inclusive of postpartum and postabortion FP. The interventions are being implemented in selected public and private facilities in Indonesia and Kenya and focus on quality FP counseling and service provision prior to discharge. This manuscript presents the study protocol, documenting how the study team intends to determine key factors that influence uptake of postpregnancy FP.   This is a multi-country, quasi-experimental three-year operations research study in Brebes and Batang Districts of Indonesia and Meru and Kilifi Counties of Kenya. Quantitative and qualitative data is collected longitudinally through interviews and health facility assessments at multiple time points. Data is gathered from 22 health facilities; 8,796 antenatal, postpartum, and postabortion clients; and key informants at national, subnational, facility, and community levels. Quantitative study data is collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Once data are thoroughly cleaned and reviewed, regression models and multilevel analyses will explore quantitative data. Qualitative study data is collected using audio recordings and transcribed to Microsoft Word, then analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Qualitative datasets will be analyzed using grounded theory methods.   The ultimate goals of the study are to generate and disseminate actionable evidence of positive drivers, barriers, and activities that do not yield results with regard to increasing postpregnancy FP programmatic activities, and to institutionalize postpregnancy FP in the public and private sectors in Indonesia and Kenya. We hope these learnings and experience will contribute to global efforts to advance and scale up postpregnancy FP in similar settings beyond these two countries.   ClinicalTrials.gov"

These adverse effects limit their use such that the growing burden of iron deficiency has not abated in recent decades. Here, we summarize the protocol of the “Safe Iron Study”, the first clinical study examining the safety and efficacy of novel forms of iron in healthy, iron-replete adults. The Safe Iron Study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Boston, MA, USA. This study compares ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO ·H O) with two novel forms of iron supplements (iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT) and organic fungal iron metabolite (Aspiron™ Natural Koji Iron)). In Phase I, we will compare each source of iron administrated at a low dose (60 mg Fe/day). We will also determine the effect of FeSO co-administrated with a multiple micronutrient powder and weekly administration of FeSO . The forms of iron found to produce no adverse effects, or adverse effects no greater than FeSO  in Phase I, Phase II will evaluate a higher, i.e., a therapeutic dose (120 mg Fe/day). The primary outcomes of this study include  malaria ( ) infectivity of host erythrocytes,  bacterial proliferation (of selected species) in presence of host plasma and intestinal inflammation assessed by fecal calprotectin. This study will test the hypotheses that the novel forms of iron, administered at equivalent doses to FeSO , will produce similar increases in iron status in iron-replete subjects, yet lower increases in   malaria infectivity,   bacterial proliferation, gut inflammation. Ultimately, this study seeks to contribute to development of safe and effective forms of supplemental iron to address the global burden of iron deficiency and anemia.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - such as hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive lung diseases – are key drivers of this widening gap, because they disproportionately afflict vulnerable populations.     Vulnerable populations with non-communicable diseases, in turn, are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 itself – but also at increased risk of poor outcomes from those underlying conditions. Proven strategies for NCD control must be adapted to help vulnerable patients react to these dual threats. We detail six key policy interventions – task shifting, workforce protection, telehealth and mobile services, insurance restructuring and increased funding for NCDs, prescription policies for NCDs and community partnerships - to bridge this care gap. Long-term integration of these care models post-COVID-19 may prevent care shocks during future pandemics, bolstering emerging universal primary care models."

This has happened during previous crises, and early indications point towards similar disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. To mitigate this, countries need to build resilient health systems capable of maintaining essential maternal and child health interventions, while also responding to COVID. How can this be accomplished?  To find some answers, we can learn from countries in the past who improved health outcomes in the face of challenging circumstances. Specific to child health, countries with positive-outlier performance in reducing under-five mortality provide helpful strategies. These lessons include a clear national plan that drives rapid response, leveraging existing data systems to inform decision-making, engaging communities via community health workers, and focusing on equity.  Today, countries around the world are facing the challenge of responding to the pandemic while building resilient health systems that continue to deliver invaluable maternal and child health services. Studying lessons from previous success stories can help inform the road ahead."

A “game-changer” vaccine targeting smallholders should be universal to protect against all field viral strains and reduce significantly, if not totally eliminate, the need for costly post-vaccination surveillance.  The ease of administration of this vaccine (eye drop or one single injection) would further contribute to its relevance in the field.  These characteristics are considered essential for the product profile of an AI vaccine that can contribute in a meaningful way to the livelihoods of poultry smallholders."

However, the Covid-19 deaths data reported by some countries display a significant weekly variability, which can make the interpretation and use of the death data in analysis and modeling difficult.   : We derive the mathematical relationship between the series of new daily deaths by reporting date and the series of deaths by death date. We then apply this formalism to the corresponding time-series reported by Sweden during the Covid-19 pandemic.   : The practice of reporting new deaths daily, as is standard procedure during an outbreak in most countries and regions, should be viewed as a time-dependent filter, modulating the underlying true death curve. After having characterized the Swedish reporting process, we show how smoothing of the Swedish reported daily deaths series results in a curve distinctly different from the true death curve. We also comment on the use of nowcasting methods.   : Modelers and analysts using the series of new daily deaths by reporting date should take extra care when it is highly variable and when there is a significant reporting delay. It might be appropriate to instead use the series of deaths by death date combined with a nowcasting algorithm as basis for their analysis."

Lockdown regulations make it more difficult for people to visit health providers to obtain information about family planning, to discuss side-effects or problems they are experiencing with their current method, and go out to obtain new family planning supplies (e.g., to renew their contraceptive injection). The inability to earn income during the lockdown may also make family planning products and services unaffordable. As a result, efforts to curb the pandemic may cause unintended interruptions in contraceptive use and may prevent non-users from adopting a contraceptive method.  Given these rapidly changing circumstances, it is important that family planning implementers make program adjustments without delay. When a timely programmatic response is of the essence, program implementers need simple behavior change models that can be used to inform programmatic decisions. This paper presents a case study of how DKT/Nigeria applied a behavior change model from persuasive design - the Fogg Behavior Model – to make timely adjustments to their contraceptive social marketing program during the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. Other public health programs, including programs that target health areas other than family planning, may be able to use similar approaches to guide the design of timely and responsive program adjustments."

Declines in the shortest intervals soon after birth reflect recent fertility declines. Variations are large by both age and parity, but in quite different patterns. Past modeling analyses demonstrate the effects of female and spouse mortality, declining fecundability, contraceptive use, and reduced sexual exposure. Both period and cohort effects can impact the curve. The open interval distribution is modelled in an equation with two parameters and calculated for the latest surveys in the 75 countries.    The time since a woman’s birth is easily captured with a single question in successive surveys. Changes in the open interval distribution serve as sensitive indicators of recent fertility changes, and the dynamics of reproductive behavior across women’s life stages are captured in new ways, as gauged by age and parity trends in the distributions."

Weinberger,Lucia H. de Oliveira",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,58,489,"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have prevented deaths due to pneumonia among children. The effect may differ between higher- and lower-income populations due to various factors, such as differences in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes, healthcare access, and PCV uptake. This study aims to evaluate an association between increasing PCV coverage and population-level declines in death due to pneumonia and its variation by socioeconomic status of subnational regions.   We analyzed municipality-level mortality data from 2005 and 2015 for children aged 2-23 months in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. We fit Poisson regression models to estimate the relationship between changes in PCV uptake and deaths due to all-cause pneumonia among subnational regions with different income levels. We controlled for changes unrelated to PCV by using data on non-respiratory deaths over time.   Uptake of the third dose of PCV varied across subnational regions and was higher in high-income regions. Higher uptake of PCV was associated with larger declines in pneumonia mortality. This association did not differ by income level of the region in Brazil and Colombia. In Peru, low-income regions observed larger declines in pneumonia deaths, but there was large uncertainty in the difference between the low- and high-income regions. We estimated that, with 90% coverage, there would be 4-38% declines in all-cause pneumonia mortality across income levels and countries.   Regions with higher PCV coverage experienced larger declines in pneumonia deaths, regardless of the income level. Having more reliable data on mortality records and vaccine uptake would improve the reliability of vaccine impact estimates."

The Bill and Melinda Gates-funded Jilinde Project was designed to identify the best ways to introduce and support PrEP services in Kenya for female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and adolescent girls and young women. We chose Developmental Evaluation (DE) as a core project approach because our goal was not just to recruit 20,000 new PrEP users, but to learn how to deliver PrEP effectively to optimally benefit users in a complex, dynamic, resource-limited setting. This paper describes how we incorporated DE into the Jilinde Project, and shares experiences and lessons learned about the value of DE in PrEP service implementation in a real-world situation.    With the Ministry of Health, Jilinde developed consensus about the structure and roll-out of PrEP services. The DE evaluator, embedded in Jilinde, designed and implemented the five-step DE methodology—collect, review, reflect, record and act—according to a core set of project guiding principles. The paper describes how we operationalized the five elements, citing findings reported and actions taken reflecting on the data. It summarizes challenges to DE implementation, such as uneven uptake and competing demands, and how we addressed those challenges.    Used consistently, DE helped adapt and refine PrEP services, improve service access, reach target audiences and improve continuation rates. The look, feel and yield of our DE efforts evolved over time, increasingly integrated into existing systems and providing deeper and richer understandings, and we learned how to better implement DE in the future.    This case study provides practical guidance for using a DE approach in program design. The DE process can be used successfully working with partners on a common complex public health challenge within a dynamic environment in a way that feeds back into and improves programs."

While there is strong evidence in favor of EBF, the evidence with regards to other interventions for linear growth is unclear. We evaluated intervention domains of micronutrients, food supplements, deworming, maternal education, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and kangaroo care, for their comparative effectiveness on linear growth.    For this review, we searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of the interventions provided to infants aged 0-6 months and/or their breastfeeding mothers in low- and middle-income countries reporting on length-for-age z-score (LAZ), stunting, length, and head circumference. We searched for reports published until September 17 , 2019 and hand-searched bibliographies of existing reviews. For LAZ and stunting, we used network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the effects of all interventions except for kangaroo care, where we used pairwise meta-analysis to compare its effects versus standard-of-care. For length and head circumference, we qualitatively summarized our findings.    We found 29 RCTs (40 papers) involving 35,119 mother and infant pairs reporting on the effects of aforementioned interventions on linear growth outcomes. Our NMA on LAZ found that compared to standard-of-care, multiple micronutrients administered to infants (MMN-C) improved LAZ (mean difference: 0.20; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.03,0.35), whereas supplementing breastfeeding mothers with MMN did not (MMN-M, mean difference: -0.02, 95%CrI: -0.18,0.13). No interventions including MMN-C (relative risk: 0.74; 95%CrI: 0.36,1.44) reduced risk for stunting compared to standard-of-care. Kangaroo care, on the other hand, improved head circumference (mean difference: 0.20 cm/week; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.09,0.31 cm/week) and length (mean difference: 0.23 cm/week; 95%CI: 0.10,0.35 cm/week) compared to standard-of-care.      Our study found important improvements for kangaroo care, but we did not find sufficient evidence for other interventions.

Several interventions, such as micronutrient and food supplements, deworming, maternal education, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), could potentially be provided to prevent stunting, but their comparative effectiveness are currently unclear. In this study, we evaluated comparative effectiveness of interventions under these domains on child linear growth outcomes of height-for-age z-score (HAZ) and stunting (HAZ <-2SD)   For this study, we searched for low- and middle-income country (LMIC)-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of aforementioned interventions provided to children during CFP.

Ozonation of drinking water, which previously has only been possible at large centralized facilities, can now be accomplished on a small-scale using microplasma technology. The efficacy of decentralized solar-powered drinking water treatment systems has not previously been described.    We established a 1,000L decentralized solar-powered water treatment system located in Kisumu County, Kenya. Highly contaminated surface water is pumped to the treatment system, which includes flocculation and filtration steps prior to ozonation. Turbidity, total coliform bacteria, and  were measured at various stages of water treatment, and bacterial log reduction values (LRVs) were calculated.    Forty-seven trials were conducted in which1000L of water were flocculated, filtered, and ozonated for 180 minutes. Baseline turbidity and   concentrations were reduced from a median of 238 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and 2,419.7 most probable number/100mL, respectively, in surface water to 1.0 NTU and undetectable   after ozonation for 180 minutes. The median  LRV was 3.99.    The solar-powered, decentralized water treatment system that utilizes ozonation for disinfection was founded to reduce   by more than 3 log-orders of magnitude despite the high turbidity of the raw water. Further research is needed to characterize limitations, scalability, economic viability, and community perspectives that could help determine the role for similar systems in other settings."

Following from the success of recent intervention programmes against gHAT, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a 2030 goal of global elimination of transmission (EOT). The key proposed indicator to measure achievement of the goal is zero reported cases. Results of previous mathematical modelling and quantitative analyses are brought together to explore both the implications of the proposed indicator and the feasibility of achieving the WHO goal.  Whilst the indicator of zero case reporting is clear and measurable, it is an imperfect proxy for EOT and could arise either before or after EOT is achieved. Lagging reporting of infection and imperfect diagnostic specificity could result in case reporting after EOT, whereas the converse could be true due to underreporting, lack of coverage, and cryptic human and animal reservoirs. At the village-scale, the WHO recommendation of continuing active screening until there are three years of zero cases yields a high probability of local EOT, but extrapolating this result to larger spatial scales is complex.  Predictive modelling of gHAT has consistently found that EOT by 2030 is unlikely across key endemic regions if current medical-only strategies are not bolstered by improved coverage, reduced time to detection and/or complementary vector control.  Unfortunately, projected costs for strategies expected to meet EOT are high in the short term and strategies that are cost-effective in reducing burden are unlikely to result in EOT by 2030. Future modelling work should aim to provide predictions while taking into account uncertainties in stochastic dynamics and infection reservoirs, as well as assessment of multiple spatial scales, reactive strategies, and measurable proxies of EOT."

Few interventions have aimed to improve person-centered family planning (PCFP) in low and middle-income countries. In this study, we tested the impact of a quality improvement (QI) intervention in Kenya on aspects of PCFP included in a validated measure of PCFP and on the overall PCFP scale.   We conducted QI cycles in three facilities providing family planning in Nairobi and Kiambu Counties, Kenya, with three facilities serving as controls. Cross-sectional baseline data was collected from 478 women receiving family planning in 2016 and end line data was collected from 640 in 2017-18.  We analysed the impact of the QI intervention on PCFP using difference-in-difference models.    We found no impact of the QI intervention on either PCFP or the overall PCFP scale.   We take away key lessons learned from the null findings of the intervention that are important for future interventions. Lessons learned include the need to be flexible in light of external factors that prolonged the study and probably led to burnout; and simplifying measurement and procedures."

A population-based retrospective study was undertaken to assess effectiveness of the PPIA model in care pathways of 64 (Patna) and 86 (Mumbai) patients through in-depth interviews conducted within 6 months of initiation treatments to identify types and facilities accessed, duration to diagnosis and treatment. Median durations based on facilities accessed were statistically analysed.  Comparisons were made with baseline values and endline pathways of patients accessing PPIA engaged/non-engaged facilities in private and public sectors.   Compared to non-engaged facilities, persons accessing engaged facilities at first point-of-care had shorter pathways (Mumbai: 32 vs 43 days), (Patna: 15 vs 40 days).  Duration for first care-seeking was considerably shorter for patients accessing PPIA in Patna and for both engaged and non-engaged private facilities in Mumbai (4 days).  Whilst PPIA engaged facilities diagnosed more cases than others, the RNTCP in Mumbai provided diagnosis early.  There was good retention of patients by PPIA-engaged (1 ) facilities (90% post-diagnosis in Patna) but this was affected by the hub-spoke referral system in Mumbai (13%). Second diagnosis is a common feature in Mumbai.  The spoke-hub model in Mumbai contributed considerably to treatment delay; PPIA-engaged providers were better at retaining patients post treatment initiation 11/25 (44%).   PPIA-engaged facilities, accessed at onset, result in marked reduction in pathway durations.  Such initiatives should engage a critical mass of competent providers, proximal investigation facilities with enhanced disease awareness and literacy efforts amongst communities.  Patient movement should be minimized for early treatment and retention."

Wu,Prabhat Jha,Sheila Dutta,Patricio Marquez",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,70,971,"Vietnam had about 15 million male smokers in 2015. To reduce adult tobacco use in Vietnam through an increase in the excise tax of cigarettes, we conducted an extended cost-effectiveness analysis to examine the impact of two scenarios of cigarette price increases.    We estimated, across income quintiles, the life-years gained, treatment cost averted, number of men avoiding catastrophic health expenditure and extreme poverty, and additional tax revenue under a 32% and a 62% increase in cigarette price through increased excise tax. We considered only male smokers as they constitute majority of the smokers. We used the average price elasticity of demand for cigarettes in Vietnam of -0.53.    Under both scenarios of price increase, men in the poorest quintile would gain about 2.8 times the life-years and avert 2.5 times the treatment cost averted by the richest quintile. With a 32% price increase, about 285,000 men would avoid catastrophic health expenditure; as a result, about 95,000 men, more than half of whom in the poorest quintile, would avoid falling into extreme poverty. In contrast to the distribution of health benefits, the extra revenue generated from men in the richest quintile would be 1.2 times that from the poorest quintile. With a 62% price increase, about 553,000 men would avoid catastrophic health expenditure, and about 183,000 men, more than half of whom in the poorest quintile, would avoid falling into extreme poverty. The extra revenue generated from men in the richest quintile would be 3.8 times that from the poorest quintile.    Higher cigarette prices would particularly benefit the poorest income quintile of Vietnamese, in terms of health and financial outcomes. Thus, tobacco taxes are an effective way to improve health and reduce poverty in Vietnam."

Tobacco taxation is the most effective intervention in reducing smoking. In this paper, we examine the impact of a one-time large cigarette price increase, through an increase in excise tax, on health and financing outcomes in four Indian states.   : We used extended cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate, across income quintiles, the life-years gained, treatment cost averted, number of men avoiding catastrophic health expenditures and extreme poverty, additional tax revenue collected, and savings to the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) with a cigarette price increase to Indian Rupees (INR) 10 plus 10%   in four Indian states.   : With the price increase, about 1.5 million men would quit smoking across the four states, with the bottom income group having 7.4 times as many quitters as the top income group (485,725 vs 65,762). As a result of quitting, about 665,000 deaths would be averted. This would yield about 11.9 million life-years, with the bottom income group gaining 7.3 times more than the top income group. Of the INR 1,729 crore in treatment cost averted, the bottom income group would avert 7.4 times more than the top income group. About 454,000 men would avoid catastrophic health expenditures and 75,000 men would avoid falling into extreme poverty. The treatment cost and impoverishment averted would save about INR 672 crore in AB-PMJAY. The tax increase would in turn, generate an additional tax revenue of about INR 4,385 crore. In contrast to the distribution of health benefits, the extra revenue generated from the top income group would be about 3.1 times that from the bottom income group.   : Cigarette tax increase can provide significant health and economic gains and is a pro-poor policy for India."

We conducted a quasi-experimental trial to evaluate the impact of scaled  releases on dengue incidence in an endemic setting in Indonesia.   In Yogyakarta City, Indonesia, following extensive community engagement,  Mel  -carrying mosquitoes were released every two weeks for 13–15 rounds over seven months in 2016–17, in a contiguous 5 km  area (population 65,000).

Thirty-four dengue cases were notified from the intervention area and 53 from the control area (incidence 26 vs 79 per 100,000 person-years) during 24 months following   deployment. This corresponded in the regression model to a 73% reduction in dengue incidence (95% confidence interval 49%,86%) associated with the  intervention.

Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods have been developed to close this gap. The main aim of this study is to identify factors associated with the use of LARCs among women of reproductive age and to examine the relationship between knowledge of LARCs and the current use of LARCs in Nigeria.   This study assessed the PMA2020 methodology and secondary dataset using female datasets from PMA 2016 (Round 3) exercise. The survey was conducted out in seven states of Nigeria. The target population for this study was women of reproductive age (15-49 years) currently using contraception prior to the survey. The sample size of women that met the inclusion criteria was 1927. The data were analyzed using frequency distribution, chi-square, and logistic regression at a 5% level of significance.   The results showed that 21.0% of women were using traditional methods. 14.8% of the sampled women were using LARCs methods. Findings further showed that at both levels of analyses, there is a significant relationship (P<0.05 and P=0.00 for binary and logistic regression, respectively) between knowledge of LARCs and the use of LARCs. This means that knowledge of LARCs and socio-demographic variables among women of reproductive age in Nigeria can influence the use of LARCs.   We concluded in this study that 14.8% of women using contraception were using LARCs. Additionally, the level of education, age of women, household wealth, and the number of living children were significantly associated with using LARCs in Nigeria. Also, when discussing contraception with women, health care practitioners should discuss the risks and benefits of LARCs with women of reproductive age and recommend them as a first-line method."

Despite new evidence highlighting the global burden of prematurity, policymakers have failed to adequately prioritize preterm birth despite the magnitude of its health impacts. Given current levels of political attention and investment, it is unlikely that the global community will be adequately mobilized to meet the 2012   report goal of reducing the preterm birth rate by 50% by 2025.      : This study adapts the Shiffman and Smith framework for political priority to examine four components contributing to policy action in global health: actor power, ideas, political context, and issue characteristics. We conducted key informant interviews with 18 experts in prematurity and reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) and reviewed key literature on preterm birth. We aimed to identify the factors that shape the global political priority of preterm birth and to describe policy opportunities to increase its priority moving forward.      : The global preterm birth community (academic researchers, multilateral organizations, government agencies, and civil society organizations) lacks evidence about the causes of and solutions to preterm birth; and country-level data quality is poor with gaps in the understanding required for implementing effective interventions. Limited funding compounds these challenges, creating divisions among experts on what policy actions to recommend. These factors contribute to the lack of priority and underrepresentation of preterm birth within the larger RMNCH agenda.      : Increasing the political priority of prematurity is essential to reduce preventable newborn and child mortality, a key target of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for health (target 3.2). This study identifies three policy recommendations for the preterm birth community: address data and evidence gaps, clarify and invest in viable solutions, and bring visibility to prematurity within the larger RMNCH agendas."

As national programs in Africa launch PrEP programs for young women, it is critical to understand how to effectively create awareness, stimulate interest, and increase uptake of PrEP.  Methods: Behavior-centered design (BCD) guided the development of a PrEP social marketing campaign for young women. Ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and focus-group discussions with young South African women informed the content and design of a 90-second PrEP demand creation video and two informational brochures. A short survey was administered to young women at their homes after watching a video to evaluate PrEP interest. Of 800 households with a 16-25-year-old female identified from a Cape Town township census, 320 women in these households viewed the video and completed a survey about the video and their interest in PrEP.  Results: In focus groups, young women from the township preferred local characters and messaging that was empowering, simple, and motivational. From the household survey of young women who viewed the video, most reported interest in learning more about PrEP (67.7% ‘definitely interested’ and 9.4% ‘somewhat interested’) and taking PrEP (56.4% ‘definitely interested’ and 12.5% ‘somewhat interested’). Factors significantly associated with interest in taking PrEP were having a primary partner with whom they regularly have sex (80.0% vs. 65.2% without a primary partner; adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.1, 95% CI: 1.3, 7.0) and being in a sexual partnership for <6 months (86.8% vs. 68.5% for >12 months; AOR=3.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 7.3).

An assessment using the Accelerated Transition Method and Family Planning Estimation Model,"Niamh Cahill,Michelle Weinberger,Leontine Alkema",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,61,611,"Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 aims to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health services. One suggested benchmark is to have at least 75% of the demand for contraception satisfied with modern methods (DS) in all countries by 2030. The translation of DS-based targets into targets for the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) is needed to make targets actionable.       We propose the Accelerated Transition (AT) method for determining the mCPR needed to reach demand-satisfied targets by 2030. The starting point for this method is the projection of DS under “business as usual” using the one-country implementation of the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPEMcountry). For countries in which the DS target is projected to be later than 2030, the AT method assumes that meeting the DS target by 2030 requires an acceleration of the contraceptive use transition such that the DS target, and its associated mCPR, will be reached in 2030 as opposed to the later year. The DS-target-associated mCPR becomes the mCPR target for the year 2030.      We apply the AT method to assess progress needed for attaining the 75% DS target for married or in-union women in the world’s poorest countries. For 50 out of 68 countries, we estimate that accelerations are needed, with required mCPR increases ranging from 4.3 to 50.8 percentage points.       The AT method quantifies the acceleration needed – as compared to business as usual projections – for a country to meet a family planning target. The method can be used to determine the mCPR needed to reach demand-satisfied targets."

Team leaders were comprised of both males and females; half had clinical backgrounds. There was no association between coaches’ or team leaders’ characteristics, namely gender, type of degree, or years of clinical training, and attendants’ adherence to essential birth practices. However, a significant inverse relationship was detected between the coach or team leader’s age and years of experience and the birth attendants’ adherence to the checklist.    Younger, less experienced coaches were more successful in promoting essential birth practices adherence in this population.

Willis,Nick Hamon",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,57,466,"The international development community has shown an increased interest in the links between malaria and gender inequality over the past two decades. Working towards the ambitious goal of eradicating malaria by 2040, suppressing the malaria burden could accelerate progress in reducing gender inequality within agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. Although numerous studies have examined narrow aspects of the relationship between malaria and gender inequality, little progress has been made in understanding how eliminating malaria could affect gender inequality within agricultural households. This Open Letter focuses on the amount of time women farmers dedicate to caregiving for malaria cases among children in agricultural households, and how reducing time spent on this activity could reduce gender inequalities and impact agricultural productivity. We argue that a research agenda is needed to inform a multi-disciplinary approach to gain this understanding. We conclude by discussing the means through which a reduction in gender inequalities in agricultural households could impact the effectiveness of vector control interventions."

The pilot was implemented from May 2017 to July 2017 in 29 public health facilities in three districts. A total of 161 CBDs received a comprehensive training in DMPA-SC, which included counselling about the method, potential side effects, correct administration and waste management. Post-training mentorship and supervision was conducted. Routine client level data was collected through Ministry of Health management information system.    During the pilot, 12,818 clients were provided with modern voluntary FP methods, with 16.4% (2,100) opting for DMPA-SC. The age range of clients opting for DMPA-SC was between 15 and 50 years, with an average of 31 years. Slightly less than half (43%) of DMPA-SC clients were adolescents and young women, with 11% aged 15–19 and 32% aged 20–24. No adverse events were reported during or immediately subsequent to the introduction of DMPA-SC administration by CBDs.    The pilot demonstrated that CBDs can safely provide DMPA-SC at the community level with appropriate public sector coordination and oversight."

This process analysis aimed to understand the degree of fidelity with which the group antenatal care model was implemented during the trial period.    We used two discreet questionnaires to collect data from two groups about the fidelity with which the group antenatal care model was implemented during this trial period. Group care facilitators recorded descriptive data about each visit and self-assessed process fidelity with a series of yes/no checkboxes. Master Trainers assessed process fidelity with an 11-item tool using a 5-point scale of 0 (worst) to 4 (best).    We analyzed 2763 questionnaires completed by group care facilitators that documented discreet group visits among pregnant and postnatal women and 140 questionnaires completed by Master Trainers during supervision visits. Data recorded by both groups was available for 84 group care visits, and we compared these assessments by visit. Approximately 80% of all group visits were provided as intended, with respect to both objective measures (e.g. group size) and process fidelity. We did not find reliable correlations between conceptually-related items scored by Master Trainers and self-assessment data reported by group visit facilitators.    We recommend both the continued participation of expert observers at new and existing group care sites and ongoing self-assessment by group care facilitators.

Sgaier",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,472,4434,"A pressing goal in global development and other sectors is often to understand what drives people’s behaviors, and how to influence them. Yet designing behavior change interventions is often an unsystematic process, hobbled by insufficient understanding of contextual and perceptual behavioral drivers and a narrow focus on limited research methods to assess them. We propose a toolkit (CUBES) of two solutions to help programs arrive at more effective interventions. First, we introduce a novel framework of behavior, which is a practical tool for programs to structure potential drivers and match corresponding interventions. This evidence-based framework was developed through extensive cross-sectoral literature research and refined through application in large-scale global development programs. Second, we propose a set of descriptive, experimental, and simulation approaches that can enhance and expand the methods commonly used in global development. Since not all methods are equally suited to capture the different types of drivers of behavior, we present a decision aid for method selection. We recommend that existing commonly used methods, such as observations and surveys, use CUBES as a scaffold and incorporate validated measures of specific types of drivers in order to comprehensively test all the potential components of a target behavior. We also recommend under-used methods from sectors such as market research, experimental psychology, and decision science, which programs can use to extend their toolkit and test the importance and impact of key enablers and barriers. The CUBES toolkit enables programs across sectors to streamline the process of conceptualizing, designing, and optimizing interventions, and ultimately to change behaviors and achieve targeted outcomes."

Mehta,Elizabeth Sasser",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,95,911,": Women living with HIV have the right to choose whether, when and how many children to have. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and contraceptives, including implants, continues to increase in Kenya. Studies have reported drug-drug interactions leading to contraceptive failures among implant users on ART. This retrospective record review aimed to determine unintentional pregnancy rates among women 15-49 years of age, living with HIV and concurrently using implants and ART in western Kenya between 2011 and 2015.   : We reviewed charts of women with more than three months of concurrent implant and ART use. Implant failure was defined as implant removal due to pregnancy or birth after implant placement, but prior to scheduled removal date. The incidence of contraceptive failure was calculated by woman-years at risk, assuming a constant rate.   : Data from 1,152 charts were abstracted, resulting in 1,190 implant and ART combinations. We identified 115 pregnancies, yielding a pregnancy incidence rate of 6.32 (5.27–7.59), with 9.26 among ETG and 4.74 among LNG implant users, respectively. Pregnancy incidence rates did not differ between EFV- and NVP-based regimens (IRR=1.00, CI: 0.71-1.43). No pregnancies were recorded among women on PI-based regimens, whereas pregnancy rates for efavirenz and nevirapine-containing regimens were similar, at 6.41 (4.70–8.73) and 6.44 (5.13–8.07), respectively. Pregnancy rates also differed significantly by implant type, with LNG implant users half as likely to experience pregnancy as ETG implant users (0.51, CI: 0.33-0.79, p>0.01).   : Our findings highlight the implications of drug-drug interaction on women’s choices for contraception."

Carolina Danovaro-Holliday",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,126,888,"Household survey data are frequently used to estimate vaccination coverage - a key indicator for monitoring and guiding immunization programs - in low and middle-income countries. Surveys typically rely on documented evidence from home-based records (HBR) and/or maternal recall to determine a child’s vaccination history, and may also include health facility sources, BCG scars, and/or serological data. However, there is no gold standard source for vaccination history and the accuracy of existing sources has been called into question.    We conducted a systematic review of literature published January 1, 1975 through December 11, 2017 that compared vaccination status at the child-level from at least two sources of vaccination history. 27 articles met inclusion criteria. The percentage point difference in coverage estimates varied substantially when comparing caregiver recall to HBRs (median: +1, range: -43 to +17), to health facility records (median: +5, range: -29 to +34) and to serology (median: -20, range: -32 to +2). Ranges were also wide comparing HBRs to facility-based records (median: +17, range: -61 to +21) and to serology (median: +2, range: -38 to +36). Across 10 studies comparing recall to HBRs, Kappa values exceeded 0.60 in 45% of comparisons; across 7 studies comparing recall to facility-based records, Kappa never reached 0.60. Agreement varied depending on study setting, coverage level, antigen type, number of doses, and child age.    Recall and HBR provide relatively concordant vaccination histories in some settings, but both have poor agreement with facility-based records and serology. Long-term, improving clinical decision making and vaccination coverage estimates will depend on strengthening administrative systems and record keeping practices. Short-term, there must be greater recognition of imperfections across available vaccination history sources and explicit clarity regarding survey goals and the level of precision, potential biases, and associated resources needed to achieve these goals."

Chakraborty,Lisa Calhoun,Ilene S. Speizer",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,131,1102,"Several measures to assess family planning service quality (FPQ) exist, yet there is limited evidence on their association with contraceptive discontinuation. Using data from the Measurement, Learning & Evaluation (MLE) Project, this study investigates the association between FPQ and discontinuation-while-in-need without switching in five cities in Kenya. Two measures of FPQ are examined – the Method Information Index (MII) and a comprehensive service delivery point (SDP) assessment rooted in the Bruce Framework for FPQ.   Three models were constructed: two to assess MII reported in household interviews (as an ordinal and binary variable) among 1,033 FP users, and one for facility-level quality domains among 938 FP users who could be linked to a facility type included in the SDP assessment. Cox proportional hazards ratios were estimated where the event of interest was discontinuation-while-in-need without switching. Facility-level FPQ domains were identified using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using SDP assessment data from 124 facilities.   A woman’s likelihood of discontinuation-while-in-need was approximately halved whether she was informed of one aspect of MII (HR: 0.45, p < 0.05), or all three (HR: 0.51, p < 0.01) versus receiving no information, when MII was assessed as an ordinal variable. Six facility-level quality domains were identified in EFA. Higher scores in information exchange, privacy, autonomy & dignity and technical competence were associated with a reduced risk of discontinuation-while-in-need (p < 0.05).   The MII has potential as an actionable metric for FPQ monitoring at the health facility level. Furthermore, family planning facilities and programs should emphasize information provision and client-centered approaches to care alongside technical competence in the provision of FP care."

The same is true for a pleasure-positive approach to sex education curricula and programmes. This research provides empirical evidence from the Love Matters' websites in Mexico, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, and India to highlight the prevalence and importance of talking about pleasure-related topics with young people.    Love Matters is an online sex education platform targeting seven countries and attracting 30 million website visits in 2018. We analysed data through Google Analytics to explore the difference between sex education-focused content and pleasure-focused content and how young people engage with different types of sexual health information on the Love Matters platforms.    Pleasure-focused content is 1.5 times more popular than sex education-focused content across all platforms. However, education-focused content attracts more organic traffic, suggesting young people purposefully search for sexual health information online. Users generally spend longer on the site engaging with sex education-focused content than pleasure-focused content.    This research provides empirical evidence from five countries in the Global South to support the notion that young people are actively looking for sexual health information that covers the full scope of sexual experience and pleasure, including – but not limited to – the reduction of health risks. This paper furthers the efforts to adopt a pleasure-positive approach to both online and offline sex education interventions."

Keshri",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,113,735,"Health economics is a sub-discipline of economics that has significant relevance to public health. The academic discipline of health economics has not evolved in India till now. Since India became independent country, the public health practice in India has revolved largely around public health systems; the private health system has functioned in parallel with negligible regulatory control by the government. The recent launch of a large health insurance program by the Indian government has opened the door of public resources for the private sector in health. It is envisaged that a substantial portion of public money will be diverted to the private sector with little regulation. This situation will potentially change the landscape of public health care delivery in the country.  With this change, the role of health economists is bound to increase, given the increased demand for economic evaluation. Ironically, there is a complete dearth of educational institutions offering specialised training in health economics in India. To fulfil this demand-supply gap, there is an urgent need to introduce the discipline of health economics at master’s level within existing university economics departments and schools of public health. Building on this foundation, academic research degrees in health economics can be evolved to fulfil future research gaps."

We intend to identify currently active maternal and neonatal data collection systems in LMICs, with the potential to inform active safety electronic surveillance for novel vaccines using standardized definitions.    A scoping review will be conducted based on established methodology. Multiple databases of indexed and grey literature will be searched with a specific focus on existing electronic and paper-electronic systems in LMICs that collect continuous, prospective, and individual-level data from antenatal care, delivery, neonatal care (up to 28 days), and postpartum (up to 42 days) at the facility and community level, at the national and district level, and at large hospitals. Also, experts will be contacted to identify unpublished information on relevant data collection systems. General and specific descriptions of Health Information Systems (HIS) extracted from the different sources will be combined and duplicated HIS will be removed, producing a list of unique statements. We will present a final list of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health systems considered flexible enough to be updated with necessary improvements to detect, assess and respond to safety concerns during the introduction of vaccines and other maternal health interventions. Selected experts will participate in an in-person consultation meeting to select up to three systems to be further explored in situ.

WHO and partners have launched a global campaign to reach zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. The primary tools for reaching this target are mass dog vaccination to interrupt transmission in domestic dog populations that maintain infection, appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies-exposed persons to prevent the fatal onset of disease, together with education to support their effective uptake. Models have been developed to assess the feasibility, impact and cost-effectiveness of these measures. From these models, we argue that the 2030 target of zero human rabies deaths is achievable, but will require concerted effort, engagement and investment. A proposed Gavi investment in human rabies vaccines has potential to drive progress towards the 2030 target; however, concomitant investment is needed to scale up mass dog vaccination or this target will be missed. Predicted economic benefits of mass dog vaccination vary according to national PEP provisioning and healthcare access. Integrated Bite Case Management can enhance surveillance and rationalize PEP use, but needs adapting to and integrating within local health systems and international reporting systems to improve PEP accountability, monitor impacts and support verification of disease freedom. Modelling approaches need refining to project realistic and geographically specific timelines for achieving targets. Model iterations informed by data on the implementation of interventions can be used to evaluate progress and guide future strategies. Critically such models are needed to advocate for investment, since the greatest risk to the ‘Zero by 30’ strategy is the limited long-term cross-sectoral or targeted financing to support countries to deliver and sustain mass dog vaccination."

As a result, some providers, including HEWs, acknowledged that married adolescent girls were previously ‘neglected’ by them, while husbands indicated that they had not previously been included in FP counselling. Findings also revealed some challenges with SS implementation as HEWs were ‘deprioritizing’ the intervention and many HEWs had been   for several years and were overworked and frustrated. Against this backdrop, A360 was viewed as adding to the HEW workload. While the programme design was focused on adolescent users, there was increasing recognition that HEWs also needed to be at the centre of solution design.   Despite challenges associated with the HEP, Ethiopia FP2020 plans to support the ‘next generation’ of HEWs, including a focus on adolescents and youth. To gain deeper insight and put the HEW at the centre of design, A360 will continue to work with the process evaluation to understand contextual barriers and enablers from the perspective of the HEW."

O’Connell,Levent Cagatay,Sumon Sengupta,Sunita Singal",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,93,870,"To accelerate progress toward Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) goals, the government of India focused on improving the quality of intrauterine device (IUD) services. EngenderHealth, an international sexual and reproductive health and rights organization, has been supporting the governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan since 2014 through the Expanding Access to IUD Services in India (EAISI) project by building the capacity of service providers, monitoring compliance with standard practices, and strengthening health systems. This study sought to assess whether EAISI-trained providers offer higher quality IUD services than non-EAISI-trained providers, as indicated by a reduction in confirmed IUD complications.   The study team conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of secondary data collected from follow-up registers at 176 intervention facilities (38 in Gujarat and 138 in Rajasthan) during Phase I of the EAISI project. The analysis included follow-up clients who returned to the same facility between April 2018 and March 2019. We performed a multivariate logistic regression to determine factors associated with IUD complications.   During the period of assessment, 56,733 clients received IUD insertions, and 10,747 (18.9%) clients returned for follow-up services. Of the returning clients, 49.4% (N=5,305) had received IUDs from EAISI-trained providers, while 50.6% (N=5,442) had received IUDs from non-EAISI-trained providers. A total of 4.0% (N=432) of all returning clients experienced complications (expulsion: 1.3%, missing strings: 1.7%, infection: 1.1%). Clients who received IUDs from non-EAISI-trained providers were 55.5% more likely (95% CI [26.2%, 91.5%], p<0.0005) to have experienced complications than clients who received insertions from EAISI-trained providers. The type of IUD, the timing of the insertion, and the timing of the follow-up visit also affected complication prevalence.   Our findings indicate that intensive, practical clinical skills training for IUD insertion can reduce the prevalence of complications."

Wall,Rosine Ingabire,Susan Allen,Etienne Karita",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,87,1179,"In two high-volume government hospitals, their two affiliated health facilities, and two additional health facilities, we developed and implemented postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD) and postpartum (PP) implant promotional counseling and service delivery procedures between May-July 2017 in Kigali, Rwanda. Between August 2017 and July 2018, 9,073 pregnant women received PPIUD/PP implant promotions who later delivered in one of our selected facilities. Of those, 2,633 had PPIUDs inserted, and 955 had PP implants inserted. The goal of the present analysis is to detail implementation expenditures and estimate incremental costs per insertion and couple years of protection (CYP) for PPIUD and PP implant users.    We detail the incremental costs during the implementation from the health system perspective (including both the implementation costs and the cost of contraceptive methods) and use of standard methods to estimate the cost per insertion and CYP for PPIUD and PP implant users. In addition to the incremental costs of labor and supplies, the costs of promotional activities are included. Research costs for formative work were excluded.    A total of $74,147 USD was spent on the implementation between August 2017 and July 2018. The largest expense (34% of total expenses) went toward personnel, including doctoral-level, administrative, data management and nurse counseling staff. Training for PPIUD and implant providers and promoters comprised 8% of total expenses. Recruitment and reimbursements comprised 6% of expenses. Costs of implants to the government comprised 12% of the expenses, much higher than the cost of IUDs (1%). Costs per insertion were $25/PPIUDs and $77/PP implant. Costs per CYP were $6/PPIUDs and $21/PP implant.     Understanding the cost per PPIUD/PP implant inserted and CYP can help to inform the cost of scaling up PPIUD/PP implant service implementation activities and resource allocation decision-making by the Rwandan Ministry of Health."

In these, yaws has been targeted for eradication by 2030, with 50% of member states certified free of yaws transmission by 2023. Here we summarise the yaws modelling literature and discuss the proposed goal and strategy. The current Morges strategy involves rounds of Total Community Treatment (TCT), in which all members of the community are treated, and Total Targeted Treatment (TTT), treating active cases and their contacts. However, modelling and empirical work suggest that latent infections are often not found in the same household as active cases, reducing the utility of household-based contact tracing for a TTT strategy. Economic modelling has also discovered uncertainty in the cost of eradication, requiring further data to give greater information. We also note the need for improved active surveillance in previously endemic countries, in order to plan future intervention efforts and ensure global eradication."

One impediment to mobilizing resources is a lack of information on product candidates, the estimated costs to move them through the pipeline, and the likelihood of specific launches. This study aimed to help fill these information gaps.   : We conducted a pipeline portfolio review to identify current candidates for 35 neglected diseases. Using an adapted version of the Portfolio to Impact financial modelling tool, we estimated the costs to move these candidates through the pipeline over the next decade and the likely launches. Since the current pipeline is unlikely to yield several critical products, we estimated the costs to develop a set of priority “missing” products.   We found 685 neglected disease product candidates as of August 31, 2017; 538 candidates met inclusion criteria for input into the model. It would cost about $16.3 billion (range $13.4-19.8B) to move these candidates through the pipeline, with three-quarters of the costs incurred in the first 5 years, resulting in about 128 (89-160) expected product launches.  Based on the current pipeline, there would be few launches of complex new chemical entities; launches of highly efficacious HIV, tuberculosis, or malaria vaccines would be unlikely. Estimated additional costs to launch one of each of 18 key missing products are $13.6B assuming lowest product complexity or $21.8B assuming highest complexity ($8.1B-36.6B). Over the next 5 years, total estimated costs to move current candidates through the pipeline and develop these 18 missing products would be around $4.5B (low complexity missing products) or $5.8B/year (high complexity missing products).   : Since current annual global spending on product development is about $3B, this study suggests the annual funding gap over the next 5 years is at least $1.5-2.8B."

Todd",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,58,610,"Afghanistan ranks among the most disadvantaged globally for many key reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) indicators, despite important gains in the past decade. Youth (15 to 24 years) are a key audience for RMNCH information as they enter adulthood, marry and begin families; however, reaching Afghan youth with health information is challenging. Internally displaced persons (IDPs), including youth, experience additional challenges to obtaining health-related information and services. This study measured current and preferred RMNCH information channels to explore the feasibility of using mobile phone technology to provide RMNCH information to IDP youth in Afghanistan.    We conducted a sub-group analysis of survey data from a mixed-methods, cross-sectional, formative assessment to understand current access to RMNCH information. The target population for this analysis includes 15-25-year-old male and female IDP youth from three Afghan Provinces. Survey data were collected using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Data were analyzed descriptively.    A total of 450 IDP youth were surveyed in the three provinces (225 male and 225 female). Access to RMNCH information outside of health facilities was limited. Mobile phone ownership was nearly universal among male participants, yet considerably lower among females; nearly all participants without personal phones reported access to phones when needed. Although few participants spontaneously mentioned mobile phones as a preferred source of RMNCH information, most male and female respondents reported they would be very or somewhat likely to use a free, mobile-phone-based system to access such information if offered.    Given widespread access and considerable interest voiced by participants, mobile phones may be a viable way to reach IDP youth with important RMNCH health information in this fragile setting. Interventions should be designed and pilot-tested to identify the most appropriate platforms and information content and to further document feasibility and acceptability."

In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) set out goals to reduce dengue mortality and morbidity by 50% and 25%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020. These goals will not be met. This is, in part, due to existing interventions being insufficiently effective to prevent spread. Further, complex and variable patterns of disease presentation coupled with imperfect surveillance systems mean that even tracking changes in burden is rarely possible. As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, WHO will propose new dengue-specific goals for 2030. The 2030 goals provide an opportunity for focused action on tackling dengue burden but should be carefully developed to be ambitious but also technically feasible. Here we discuss the potential for clearly defined case fatality rates and the rollout of new and effective intervention technologies to form the foundation of these future goals. Further, we highlight how the complexity of dengue epidemiology limits the feasibility of goals that instead target dengue outbreaks."

This study sought to evaluate the EHR system in six departments (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, laboratory, reception cashiers and MCH managers) of these MCH centers in terms of ease of performing tasks and satisfaction with the system.   A cross-sectional method with formative evaluation was used to address the objective. A sample size of 54 were used for the investigation. The participants were from six departments (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, laboratory, reception cashiers and MCH managers) within three MCH centers. Data was collected using structured, self-administered questionnaires and interviews and analyzed using SPSS 20.   In total, 83% of respondents found that performing tasks using EHR made tasks easier; the lowest score was from Pharmacy department (48%). The overall satisfaction with EHR was 87%. The lowest score is from the indicator “the system meets my needs” (80%).   Staffs in all department reported the EHR system as “very good” for both ease of performing their daily tasks and satisfaction with the system. In addition, the study revealed that ease of performing tasks and satisfaction with the system were varied by department and specific task within the department. It is essential to know the needs and requirements of each department before implementation of the system and user feedback for long lasting uptake and impact."

On the Indian subcontinent (ISC), VL is targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for elimination as a public health problem by 2020, which is defined as <1 VL case (new and relapse) per 10,000 population at district level in Nepal and sub-district level in Bangladesh and India. WHO is currently in the process of formulating 2030 targets, asking whether to maintain the 2020 target or to modify it, while adding a target of zero mortality among detected cases. The NTD Modelling Consortium has developed various mathematical VL transmission models to gain insight into the transmission dynamics of VL, identify the main knowledge gaps, and predict the feasibility of achieving and sustaining the targets by simulating the impact of varying intervention strategies. According to the models, the current target is feasible at the appropriate district/sub-district level in settings with medium VL endemicities (up to 5 reported VL cases per 10,000 population per year) prior to the start of the interventions. However, in settings with higher pre-control endemicities, additional efforts may be required. We also highlight the risk that those with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may pose to reaching and sustaining the VL targets, and therefore advocate adding control of PKDL cases to the new 2030 targets. Spatial analyses revealed that local hotspots with high VL incidence remain. We warn that the current target provides a perverse incentive to not detect/report cases as the target is approached, posing a risk for truly achieving elimination as a public health problem although this is taken into consideration by the WHO procedures for validation. Ongoing modelling work focuses on the risk of recrudescence when interventions are relaxed after the elimination target has been achieved."

Our modelling insights on   have shown that EPHP is likely to be attainable in low to moderate prevalence settings using the current guidelines. However, as prevalence rises within high prevalence settings, EPHP is less likely to be achieved unless both school-aged children and adults are treated (with coverage levels increasing with the adult burden of infection). We highlight the challenges that are faced by treatment programmes, such as non-adherence to treatment and resurgence, which can hinder progress towards achieving and maintaining EPHP. Additionally, even though EPHP may be reached, prevalence can still be high due to persisting infections. Therefore, without interruption of transmission, treatment will likely have to continue to maintain EPHP. Further modelling work is being carried out, including extending our results to  .

However, discontinuation rates among injectable users were high (38%). Given that the public sector is the major source for injectable contraceptives, John Snow Inc. (JSI) in collaboration with ideas42 worked with Ethiopia’s flagship Health Extension Program to apply behavioral design to mitigate discontinuation of injectable contraceptives.    We applied behavioral economics insights to mitigate the discontinuation of injectable contraceptives. This process created an intervention package, consisting of a health worker planning calendar, a client counseling job aid, and client appointment cards. A stratified-pair cluster-randomized field trial tested the effectiveness of the intervention. The study area included two districts from the four regions where JSI was implementing a family planning program. One district from each region was randomly allocated to the intervention arm. Women visiting health posts to use injectable contraceptives were enrolled in the study. Regression methods, adjusted for study design, participants’ backgrounds, and contextual factors, estimated the intervention’s effect on discontinuation rates.    A behavioral design methodology was feasibly implemented in a rural, low-resource setting in Ethiopia. The resultant intervention package was successfully delivered in 19 satellite health posts in four districts. Intervention adherence was high for the appointment cards and counseling job aid, but not for the planning calendar. The injectable discontinuation rate was 10.8 % (95% confidence interval: 2.2, 19.3) points lower in the intervention area compared to the control area during the post-intervention follow-up survey.    The use of two tools informed by behavioral economics —the appointment card and counseling job aid—effectively decreased injectable discontinuation even with the presence of other health system bottlenecks. Behavioral economics insights and the behavioral design methodology have the potential to enhance family planning programs in Ethiopia and elsewhere."

These youth leaders provided their perspectives on the most important influencers for youth FP use, how easy or hard it is for youth to obtain FP, preferred sources of FP methods for youth, and perceptions of commonly used terms in FP programming. We examined differences in perceptions of unmarried and married youth’s access to and use of FP using bivariate analyses.   : Respondents reported that peers/friends were the most important influencer on use of FP among unmarried youth (80.2%), while spouse/partner was the most important for married youth (80.4%). Oral contraceptive pills, injectable contraception, and contraceptive implants were perceived as significantly harder for unmarried youth to access. Privacy, confidentiality, and anonymity were all important factors for the locations to access FP for unmarried youth, while married youth were more influenced by cost. None of the commonly used terms for FP were perceived positively by a majority of respondents, with the exception of ‘birth spacing’ by African respondents (51.0%).   : These findings indicate that the preferences and needs of unmarried youth are different than married youth, but that all young people face barriers accessing FP. Unmarried youth seeking FP are more influenced by peers and friends and continue to face difficulty accessing methods compared to married youth. These findings indicate the importance of including youth perspectives in development of youth-focused family planning programs."

Dried blood spot (DBS) is a robust potential alternative sample source for epidemiological studies & bio banking. A stable source of genomic DNA (gDNA) is required for long term storage in bio bank for its downstream applications. Our objective is to optimize the methods of gDNA extraction from stored DBS and with the aim of revealing its utility in large scale epidemiological studies.    The purpose of this study was to extract the maximum amount of gDNA from DBS on Whatman 903 protein saver card. gDNA was extracted through column  (Qiagen) & magnetic bead based (Invitrogen) methods. Quantification of extracted gDNA was performed with a spectrophotometer, fluorometer, and integrity analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.    Large variation was observed in quantity & purity (260/280 ratio, 1.8-2.9) of the extracted gDNA. The intact gDNA bands on the electrophoresis gel reflect the robustness of DBS for gDNA even after prolonged storage time. The extracted gDNA amount 2.16 – 24 ng/µl is sufficient for its PCR based downstream application, but unfortunately it can’t be used for whole genome sequencing or genotyping from extracted gDNA. Sequencing or genotyping can be achieved by after increasing template copy number through whole genome amplification of extracted gDNA. The obtained results create a base for future research to develop high-throughput research and extraction methods from blood samples.   The above results reveal, DBS can be utilized as a potential and robust sample source for bio banking in field epidemiological studies."

This analysis seeks to compare the contraceptive method mix in routine and post-abortion contraception services and to suggest how multifaceted service delivery approaches can help address the unmet family planning need.   The intervention was implemented in 127 public health facilities providing both routine and post-abortion contraception services, from 2010 to 2017.  The intervention focused on service delivery and program management gaps identified during the baseline assessment.  Service data regularly collected from intervention facilities and entered into a Microsoft Excel database to conduct descriptive analysis, review trends, and monitor progress.   Trend analysis of method choice patterns revealed that the share of method mix for long-acting reversible contraceptives(LARCs) rose from 3% in 2010 to 40% in 2017 in routine family planning service, whereas in the post-abortion contraception service, the share for LARCs climbed from 2% in 2010 to 62% in 2017(P<0.001).  Trend analysis of LARC uptake in post-abortion contraception revealed that implant use rose from 2% in 2010 to 54% in 2017, while intrauterine device (IUD) use increased from 0.1% in 2010 to 9% in 2017.  In routine program, proportion of implant acceptors increased from 3% in 2010 to 35% in 2017, while IUD acceptance increased far more slowly, from only 0.07% to 5% over the same period.   Comprehensive contraceptive service delivery strategies, such as integration of family planning with other maternal health services can help the service to reach clients with a variety of needs, a key factor for a higher uptake of LARCs by abortion clients as compared to routine family planning program."

The designers/implementers had previously, successfully implemented a tobacco control intervention with adolescents in Botswana. This experience had informed the initial intervention design in Ghana. As the feedback generated by evaluators started demonstrating just how different the Ghanaian social and media contexts were from the Botswanan one, implementers started making changes to their selection of channels, resulting in a design which was quite different from the original one. The close involvement of the donor in this process enabled implementers to make rapid changes to the design of the intervention. This illustration adds to a small but growing literature establishing the importance of feedback loops to improve the design and implementation of development interventions."

Community-based family planning (CBFP) is a key strategy in expanding access to FP services through community health workers or Village Health Team (VHTs) members in Uganda. We established the first CBFP learning site in Busia district, Uganda, using a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) model. This process evaluation aims to understand the QIC adaptation process, supportive implementation factors and trends in FP uptake and retention.    We collected data from two program districts: Busia (learning site) and Oyam (scale-up). We used a descriptive mixed-methods process evaluation design: desk review of program documents, program monitoring data and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions.    The quality improvement (QI) process strengthened linkages between health services provided in communities and health centers. Routine interaction of VHTs, clients and midwives generated improvement ideas. Participants reported increased learning through midwife mentorship of VHTs, supportive supervision, monthly meetings, data interpretation and learning sessions. Three areas for potential sustainability and institutionalization of the QI efforts were identified: the integration of QI into other services, district-level plans and support for the QIC and motivation of QI teams. Challenges in the replication of this model include the community-level capacity for data recording and interpretation, the need to simplify QI terminology and tools for VHTs and travel reimbursements for meetings. We found positive trends in the number of women on an FP method, the number of returning clients and the number of couples counseled.    A QIC can be a positive approach to improve VHT service delivery. Working with VHTs on QI presents specific challenges compared to working at the facility level.

Hayes,Luke Mason,Anna Blasi,Samantha McCann,Momodou K. Darboe,Michelle de Haan,Sophie E. Moore,Sarah Lloyd-Fox,Clare E. Elwell",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,236,1532,"Infants and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are frequently exposed to a range of environmental risk factors which may negatively affect their neurocognitive development. The mechanisms by which factors such as undernutrition and poverty impact development and cognitive outcomes in early childhood are poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is due in part to a paucity of objective assessment tools which can be implemented across different cultural settings and in very young infants. Over the last decade, technological advances, particularly in neuroimaging, have opened new avenues for research into the developing human brain, allowing us to investigate novel biological associations. This paper presents functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking (ET) as objective, cross-cultural methods for studying infant neurocognitive development in LMICs, and specifically their implementation in rural Gambia, West Africa. These measures are currently included, as part of a broader battery of assessments, in the Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) project, which is developing brain function for age curves in Gambian and UK infants from birth to 24 months of age. The BRIGHT project combines fNIRS, EEG and ET with behavioural, growth, health and sociodemographic measures. The implementation of these measures in rural Gambia are discussed, including methodological and technical challenges that needed to be addressed to ensure successful data acquisition. The aim is to provide guidance to other groups seeking to implement similar methods in their research in other LMICs to better understand associations between environmental risk and early neurocognitive development."

Ghana formally launched the National Community Health Worker (CHW) program in 2014, to augment the pre-existing Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS). To date, however, there is scant data about the program’s implementation. We describe the current supervision and service delivery status of CHWs throughout the country.      Data were collected regarding CHW supervision and service delivery during the 2017 round of the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey. Descriptive analyses were performed by facility type, supervisor type, service delivery type, and regional distribution.      Over 80% of CHWs had at least monthly supervision interactions, but there was variability in the frequency of interactions. Frequency of supervision interactions did not vary by facility or supervisor type. The types of services delivered by CHWs varied greatly by facility type and region. Community mobilization, health education, and outreach for loss-to-follow-up were delivered by over three quarters of CHWs, while mental health counseling and postnatal care are provided by fewer than one third of CHWs. The Western region and Greater Accra had especially low rates of CHW service provision. Non-communicable disease treatment, which is not included in the national guidelines, was reportedly provided by some CHWs in nine out of ten regions.      Overall, this study demonstrates variability in supervision frequency and CHW activities. A high proportion of CHWs already meet the expected frequency of supervision. Meanwhile, there are substantial differences by region of CHW service provision, which requires further research, particularly on novel CHW services such as non-communicable disease treatment. While there are important limitations to these data, these findings can be instructive for Ghanaian policymakers and implementers to target improvement initiatives for community-based services."

In total 76% of Rwandan women want family planning postpartum, yet a 26% unmet need remains. Currently, the four most commonly used postpartum family planning methods in Rwanda are injections, subdermal implants, pills, and condoms. The economic and health benefit impact of the current method selection has not yet been evaluated.    To evaluate the impact of current usage rates and method types, this cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) compared the most frequently used family planning methods in Rwanda broken into two categories, longer-acting reversible contraception (LARC) (injections and subdermal implants) and shorter-acting reversible contraceptives (non-LARC) (pills and condoms). A time horizon of 24 months was used to reflect the World Health Organization suggested two-year spacing from birth until the next pregnancy, and was conducted from a health systems perspective. This CEA compared two service package options to provide a comparator for the two method types, thus enabling insights to differences between the two.    For women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in Rwanda, including LARC postpartum family planning methods in the options, saves $18.73 per pregnancy averted, compared to family planning options that offer non-LARC methods exclusively.    There is an opportunity to avert unplanned pregnancies associated with increased utilization of LARC methods. The full benefits of LARC are not yet realized in Rwanda. Under the conditions presented in this study, a service package that includes LARC has the potential to be cost-saving compared with one non-LARC methods. Effective health messaging of LARC use for the postpartum population could both enhance health and reduce costs."

New contraceptive technologies may improve uptake and use. This study examines desirable product characteristics.   : We added a module to the female questionnaire of the PMA2020 surveys in Burkina Faso and Uganda and conducted 50 focus group discussions (FGDs) with women, 10 FGDs with men, and 37 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with providers across the two countries. FGDs with women and IDIs with providers included a semi-structured ranking exercise on pre-selected product characteristics.   : Effectiveness, duration, few side effects, cost, and access were the characteristics most commonly reported as important in choosing a method by survey respondents across both countries. Half or more of women surveyed in each country would like a method that lasts at least one year, while 65% in Burkina Faso and 40% in Uganda said they would use a method causing amenorrhea. Qualitative findings show that women want methods with minimal and predictable side effects. Reactions to increased bleeding were negative, especially in Burkina Faso, but perspectives on reduced bleeding were more mixed. Women and providers preferred methods that are discreet and not user-dependent, and associate duration with convenience of use. Some women in Uganda expressed concerns about the invasive nature of long-acting methods, and cost was an important consideration in both countries. In the ranking exercise, discreet use and few side effects often ranked high, while causing amenorrhea and not requiring a pelvic exam often ranked low.   : Product development should consider user preferences for success in these settings."

Although impressive progress has been made, the initial target year of 2020 will not be met everywhere. The World Health Organization recently proposed 2030 as the new target year for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem. In this letter, LF modelers of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) Modelling Consortium reflect on the proposed targets for 2030 from a quantitative perspective. While elimination as a public health problem seems technically and operationally feasible, it is uncertain whether this will eventually also lead to complete elimination of transmission. The risk of resurgence needs to be mitigated by strong surveillance after stopping interventions and sometimes perhaps additional interventions."

Measuring access in resource-limited settings, however, is challenging, especially with the data available at the district level, which is the primary administrative division for most immunization programs. Despite calls to improve routine data collection and use, there remains a lack of structured methods and practical tools to target underserved populations. Herein, we describe a prospective study that aims to develop, pilot, and validate a set of user-friendly tools to identify geographic areas with limited access to immunization services and by extension, low immunization coverage. The approach will leverage routinely-collected data from public health facilities combined with novel methods of household mapping to perform spatial analyses using open-access platforms. In addition, we will triangulate the analyses across datasets representing common reasons for care seeking – namely, visits for vaccination, antenatal care, and malaria – to improve the accuracy of our estimates. The ultimate goal of this project is to equip front-line providers and district level program managers with novel tools that facilitate timely and accurate analysis of routinely-collected data to guide immunization efforts."

There is currently no formal global scabies control programmes or existing WHO guidelines on scabies control although at least two countries, Fiji and Ethiopia, have adopted national approaches to scabies control. In February 2019 WHO held a first Informal Consultation on a Framework for Scabies Control, in part as a response to multiple national requests for guidance on public health management in high disease burden areas. Below we outline control strategies proposed at this meeting and summarise the role that modelling can play in supporting the development of evidence to translate these proposals into formal WHO recommendations and national and global control programmes. Provisional proposals discussed at the WHO Informal Consultation for a scabies control programme include the use of mass drug administration when the community prevalence of scabies is ≥ 10% (generally considered to reflect a childhood prevalence of at least 20%) and the use of intensified case management when the prevalence is below 10%."

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed goals for CD elimination as a public health problem to be reached by 2030 by means of achieving intradomiciliary transmission interruption (IDTI), blood transfusion and transplant transmission interruption, diagnostic and treatment scaling-up and prevention and control of congenital transmission. The NTD Modelling Consortium has developed mathematical models to study  transmission dynamics and the potential impact of control measures. Modelling insights have shown that IDTI is feasible in areas with sustained vector control programmes and no presence of native triatomine vector populations. However, IDTI in areas with native vectors it is not feasible in a sustainable manner. Combining vector control with trypanocidal treatment can reduce the timeframes necessary to reach operational thresholds for IDTI (<2% seroprevalence in children aged <5 years), but the most informative age groups for serological monitoring are yet to be identified. Measuring progress towards the 2030 goals will require availability of vector surveillance and seroprevalence data at a fine scale, and a more active surveillance system, as well as a better understanding of the risks of vector re-colonization and disease resurgence after vector control cessation. Also, achieving scaling-up in terms of access to treatment to the expected levels (75%) will require a substantial increase in screening asymptomatic populations, which is anticipated to become very costly as CD prevalence decreases. Further modelling work includes refining and extending mathematical models (including transmission dynamics and statistical frameworks) to predict transmission at a sub-national scale, and developing quantitative tools to inform IDTI certification, post-certification and re-certification protocols. Potential perverse incentives associated with operational thresholds are discussed. These modelling insights aim to inform discussions on the goals and treatment guidelines for CD."

For two decades, CHPS has been Ghana’s flagship program for achieving universal health coverage (UHC). When monitoring during its first decade determined that the pace of CHPS scale-up was unacceptably slow, the Ghana Health Service launched the Ghana Essential Health Interventions Program (GEHIP) in four Upper East Region districts to test means of accelerating to CHPS implementation and improving its quality of care. To evaluate GEHIP, a two-round randomized sample survey was fielded with clusters sampled at baseline that were reused in the endline to facilitate difference-in-difference estimation of changes in fertility associated with GEHIP exposure.  Monitoring operations assessed the location, timing, and content of CHPS primary health care. Discrete time hazard regression analysis on merged baseline and endline birth history data permit estimation of GEHIP fertility and CHPS access effects, adjusting for hospital and clinical service access and household social and economic confounders.    GEHIP exposure was associated with an immediate acceleration of CHPS implementation and coverage. Women residing in households with CHPS services had only slightly lower fertility than women who lacked convenient access to CHPS. GEHIP impact on contraceptive use was statistically significant but marginal; GEHIP exposure was associated with increasing unmet need.    Results challenge the assumption that achieving UHC will reduce excess fertility.  Social mobilization, community-outreach, connection of family planning discussions with male social networks are elements of the Navrongo success story that have atrophied with CHPS scale-up.  Achieving UHC does not address the need for renewed attention to these family planning focused strategies."

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of CBHI on modern family planning (FP) utilization as part of its routine outcome monitoring activities.   The USAID Transform: Primary Health Care project, conducted a continuous monitoring follow up visit using a multistage sampling technique in its four major targeted regions. A total of 3433 households were selected and 3313 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were interviewed. The questionnaire captured the CBHI status of each household and FP use data from randomly selected women. Microsoft Access database was used to enter the data, which was then transferred to SPSS Version 20 for further analysis.    49% of women (aged 15-49 years) were found to be enrolled in CBHI scheme.  Half of the women (50.2%) use any family planning method, of which 49% of them used modern family planning method in project-supported areas. Over half of women (57%) who are exposed to CBHI schemes utilized family planning method which is statistically significant    Modern FP utilization among insured women was higher compared with uninsured women. While FP methods are provided for free, CBHI enrollment improves FP use among women of child-bearing age. Women who have access to CBHI may frequently visit health facilities seeking services for themselves and their families, during which they may be introduced to FP services. This in turn may improve their awareness and attitude towards FP. The results will increase awareness for program implementer's of the benefits of CBHI schemes in FP programming, particularly in rural settings, and provide an opportunity to increase lifelong returns in Ethiopia."

This study evaluates the efficacy of one such tool, the Parental Evaluation of Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones (PEDS:DM), developed in the United States and tested in the lower income Asian country of Bhutan. We aimed to test the PEDS:DM instrument to measure neurodevelopmental delay in children in Bhutan.       In total, 96 community-dwelling Bhutanese children (3-7 years old) without diagnosed neurocognitive conditions were recruited from ambulatory clinics in urban Bhutan in 2016 as part of a larger study on retinal imaging and cognitive and growth parameters. Scoring was based on neurocognitive domains (gross and fine motor, receptive and expressive speech, self-help, social-emotional). Rates of failure (meant to indicate delay) within domains were calculated.       Modifications of some standard questions were deemed necessary by the study staff to suit the cultural context, such as replacing kickball with football in a question regarding games played with rules to maintain local relevance. In a modified PEDS:DM test with these improvised modifications, the mean percentage of age-appropriate domains failed was 58.8% and the mean percent delay was 12.3% (range 0-41.4%, available in n=83). The highest prevalence of failures was 59.4% for receptive language and 76.3% for expressive language, much higher than the lowest rate of failure seen in self-help (5.4%).        The PEDS:DM requires further modifications and validation studies before it can be reliably implemented to assess developmental delay in children in Bhutan. In this pilot study, the rate of delay as reported by the PEDS:DM would be scored as markedly elevated, especially when compared to available epidemiologic studies in the region."

The available evidence is limited, but demonstrates that such integrated programming can catalyze improved outcomes in both sectors. We reviewed available program evidence to explore what information is available to implementers regarding potential best practices.    Economic growth is a broad sector; we focused specifically on the need for evidence related to integration of family planning with microfinance and livelihood programs. We conducted an extensive literature search and reviewed both published and gray literature according to two criteria: whether the papers explicitly focused on FP/EG integration and whether they included program descriptions, including discussions of what specific interventions were implemented.    We find that only limited information exists regarding how best to design and implement such programs for FP/RH and economic growth. We provide ideas drawn from the identified program evidence about potential best practices for FP/RH and economic growth integrated programs, and find an increasing need for tools and resources on related best practices.    Both family planning and economic growth programs should consider strengthening linkages between the two sectors, to accelerate the achievement of global family planning goals as well as to improve economic growth outcomes. We call for additional research and improved documentation to clarify the apparent contributions and effectiveness of FP/EG integration, as well as to confirm promising practices. The integration of family planning and economic growth sectors is particularly important as the global community works toward achieving broader global and country-level development goals."

A cross-sectional study,"Victor Chima,Oluwatobi Abel Alawode",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,127,1550,"The world currently has the highest number of adolescents in all of history. Africa is home to quite a number of them, with most of these adolescents in Africa live in rural areas where they are more disadvantaged and their reproductive decisions could have telling impacts on their lives, family planning (contraception) has been identified as important to avoid such impacts. Factors associated with the use of modern contraceptives among female adolescents have been extensively researched but the importance of mass media family planning messages on modern contraceptives use among female adolescents in rural Nigeria is under-researched, hence this study.   This paper uses the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data with a weighted sample size (n=4473) to examine the association between exposure to family planning messages and use of modern contraceptives among female adolescents in rural Nigeria.   Findings indicated that exposure to family planning messages on radio and television were significantly associated with modern contraceptive use, however, educational attainment and region of residence were other factors that influenced modern contraceptive use..   The study concludes that family planning messages through mass media especially radio and television are associated with modern contraceptives use among rural adolescents. The continued use of mass media would enhance opportunities to achieve more results, however, other interventions addressing education with objectives of closing the rural-urban socio-economic gap should be encouraged also, as these factors play critical roles in improving uptake of family planning among rural adolescents.  Further, messages on modern contraceptive use should be sensitive to regional divides in terms of content and delivery."

The public sector program featured a proactive community-based distribution (CBD) model, led by community health extension workers (CHEWs) and supported by community health volunteers (CHVs).      We conducted monitoring and evaluation (M&E) alongside program implementation to understand the program’s reach, particularly in terms of clients served, and their proportions of new users of modern contraception and younger women. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated from end-user data digitized from client registers. To evaluate performance trends over time and understand geographic variation, we analyzed quarterly data in Excel and Stata 15, and complemented these analyses with data from interviews conducted periodically with program staff and performance documentation submitted by implementing partners.      The program reached 144,505 clients, of whom 88% (n=127,315) were women. Among women reached, 92% (n=116,614) chose DMPA-SC. The program reached a high percentage of new users of modern contraception: 80% (n=93,075) of DMPA-SC clients were new users, as were 80% (n=111,350) of overall clients. However, only 26% (n=36,313) of clients were under 25. From performance reports and interviews with program staff, many involved credited the CBD model with reaching a client base largely comprised of new users of modern contraception.      Our analysis of the Nigeria public sector DMPA-SC program suggests that the combination of DMPA-SC and proactive CBD may accelerate contraceptive uptake and reduce unmet need in Nigeria. While some strategies for increasing the cost-efficiency of the CBD emerged, future research on this delivery model should focus on key concerns about the modality’s sustainability."

From October 2017 to February 2018, 459 women (N =235; N =224) completed a phone survey from a convenience sample of 1,444 women (N =912; N =532) who obtained DMPA-SC from participating providers and agreed to be contacted. We examined the sociodemographic predictors of attending a public vs. private provider and analyzed differences in care-seeking across sectors (becoming aware of DMPA-SC, choosing a provider, choosing DMPA-SC, quality of care).    Respondents obtaining DMPA-SC from public providers were younger and less educated than those attending private providers. Both program respondents were comprised of similar percentages of new users of modern contraception (58.7-60.3%), although most respondents became aware of DMPA-SC through a friend/family member (43.1%) or a provider (41.5%). Relatively more public sector respondents also heard about DMPA-SC through community outreaches whereas relatively more private sector respondents became aware through media. Convenience was the most common reason for choosing a provider—43.8% among all respondents (higher among public sector respondents). Private sector respondents were also more likely to choose a past or usual provider. Having overall higher quality interactions were more likely among clients who attended private providers than public providers, but responses to individual quality item measures show specific areas of poor quality for providers in each sector.    Training emphasizing technical thoroughness, sensitivity toward younger women, and client choice may help improve women’s experiences with obtaining DMPA-SC, ultimately contributing to accelerating demand for and uptake of DMPA-SC specifically and contraception in general."

As such, its health systems and health infrastructure are exposed to recurrent disasters. Research studying the impacts of natural disasters on reproductive health in particular is lacking. This research contributes to this knowledge gap by studying the challenges related to menstrual regulation and post-abortion care at both the facility and community levels, and the care-seeking patterns of pregnant women during the 2016 flood in Belkuchi, Bangladesh.   Six government-run primary health care facilities were assessed using a structured assessment tool prior to the flood of 2016. In total, 370 structured interviews were conducted with women in three unions of Belkuchi (Belkuchi Sadar, Daulatpur and Bhangabari) 4 months after the 2016 flood.   The main challenges at the facility level are a lack of services and a shortage of medicines, equipment and trained health workers. The main challenges at the community level are displacement, high rates of self-diagnosed spontaneous abortion and a lack of treatment for post-abortion complications. A majority of the interviewed women (48%) sought menstrual regulation from the residence of a nurse or family welfare visitor. In total, 73.2% of the women who experienced post-abortion complications sought medical care.   To overcome the challenges at the facility level, it is important to construct flood-resistant health infrastructure and train health workers in menstrual regulation and post-abortion care, so that these services can be made available during a flood. At the community level, more research is required to understand the reasons for spontaneous abortions so that these, and the subsequent chronic conditions/complications women experience, may be avoided. Context specific interventions that can overcome local challenges (both at the community and facility levels) are required to promote disaster resilience at primary health care facilities."

Gilchrist,Robert Newton,Calman A. MacLennan",,46,309,"Invasive nontyphoidal   (iNTS) disease is a major cause of deaths among children and HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. Acquisition of IgG to iNTS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen in Malawi in early childhood corresponds with a fall in cases of iNTS disease suggesting that vaccines able to induce such antibodies could confer protection. To better understand the acquisition of IgG to iNTS in other African settings, we performed a cross-sectional seroepidemiological study using sera from 1090 Ugandan individuals aged from infancy to old age. Sera were analysed for IgG to LPS O-antigen of  . Typhimurium and  . Enteritidis using an in-house ELISA. Below 18 months of age, most children lacked IgG to both serovars. Thereafter, specific IgG levels increased with age, peaking in adulthood, and did not wane noticeably in old age. There was no clear difference in antibody levels between the sexes and the few HIV-infected individuals in the study did not have obviously different levels from uninfected subjects. While IgG to iNTS is acquired at a younger age in Malawian compared with Ugandan children, it is not clear whether this is due to differences in the populations themselves, their exposure to iNTS, or variations between assays used. In conclusion, there is a need to develop a harmonised method and standards for measuring antibodies to iNTS across studies and to investigate acquisition of such antibodies with age across different sites in sub-Saharan Africa."

A two-arm, two-phase, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) (non-blinded) is being conducted in Kenya and Nigeria. Public health facilities were matched and randomized to either standard individual ANC (control) or G-ANC (intervention) prior to enrollment. Participants include pregnant women attending first ANC at gestational age <24 weeks, health care providers, and sub-national health managers. Enrollment ended in June 2017 for both countries. In the intervention arm, pregnant women are assigned to cohorts at first ANC visit and receive subsequent care together during five meetings facilitated by a health care provider (Phase 1). After birth, the same cohorts meet four times over 12 months with their babies (Phase 2). Data collection was performed through surveys, clinical data extraction, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Phase 1 data collection ended in January 2018 and Phase 2 concludes in November 2018. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to evaluate primary outcomes for Phases 1 and 2: health facility delivery and use of a modern method of family planning at 12 months postpartum, respectively. Data analysis and reporting of results will be consistent with norms for cRCTs. General estimating equation models that account for clustering will be employed for primary outcome analyzes.    Overall 1,075 and 1,013 pregnant women were enrolled in Nigeria and Kenya, respectively. Final study results will be available in February 2019.    This is the first cRCT on G-ANC in Africa.

There is limited information on awareness and accessibility to family planning services among women living with HIV in Myanmar.    A mixed-methods cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from Feb-March, 2018 at two antiretroviral therapy (ART) centers in Myanmar.    This study included 184 women living with HIV. The mean (SD) age was 38 (9) years. In total, 90 women (49%) were married, 10 (5%) were single. Among the respondents, 124 (67%) have never received health education on family planning, and 64 (35%) didn’t know any source of information for family planning services. In the last six months, 55 (30%) of them have used any type of contraception. Among married women, 16 (29%) intended to have a child. One-fourth of women with HIV responded that transmission of HIV from mother to child cannot be preventable. Perceived geographical accessibility to any type of family planning services was measured, and only 7% had high accessibility. The main barriers to accessing family planning information and services among women living with HIV were also explored. Most participants responded that they had poor knowledge and received insufficient information on the family planning services. Some of them mentioned they had financial constraints to access modern contraceptive methods. Key informant interviews with public service providers revealed that there was the lack of referral system, and poor linkage between ART teams and maternal and reproductive health teams for women living with HIV to provide the quality family planning services.    This study highlighted the need for awareness raising among women living with HIV about family planning, and effective referral system between maternal and reproductive health unit, and HIV/AIDS care unit in Myanmar."

Female sex workers (FSWs) are at increased risk of both unintended pregnancy and acquiring HIV, which could lead to adverse sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. We sought to assess contraceptive use or non-use, preferences and determinants among a cohort of FSWs screened for an HIV prevention clinical trial in Kisumu, Kenya.   A cross sectional study of healthy FSWs referred for possible recruitment into the Antibody Mediated HIV Prevention (AMP) Study was conducted between December 2016 and September 2018. Potentially eligible participants were screened for HIV and data on social-demographic, contraceptive use and other SRH characteristics were collected. Those not on a method recorded their contraceptive preferences.     Data on 210 FSWs with a median age of 24.5 years (interquartile range, IQR 22-26) are presented. Of these, 187 (89.1%) had two children or fewer; only 56 (26.7%) had completed secondary or higher education. At the time of the interview, 18 (8.6%) were HIV-infected and 181 (86.2%) were using a modern contraceptive. Implants (48.6%) and depot injections (37.6%) were the most commonly used methods. Most (41.4%) of those not on family planning preferred oral pills. Respondents who had two or more children were three times more likely than their primiparous and nulliparous counterparts to report use of a contraceptive. Use of modern contraception methods did not differ by respondent’s ownership of a medical insurance cover or other occupation.   There is high use of modern contraception among FSWs in Kisumu with the majority using subdermal implants. Reproductive health programs should implement targeted SRH interventions for specific populations and risk groups. Effective contraceptive counselling and interventions among FSWs should consider the client’s parity and level of education."

One area that has not received enough attention is that of women’s empowerment. This study sought a better understanding of how women’s empowerment influences contraceptive uptake.    A structured questionnaire was used to interview 761 currently married or cohabiting women aged 15-49 years who were residents of Asawasi and Oforikrom for at least two years and consented to be part of the study. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to link the exposure variables: the three measures of empowerment and other variables such as age, marital status, religion, education, ethnicity, income and number of living children with the outcome variable (current or future contraceptive use). Excel was used for data entry and STATA for analyses.   In total, 29% of respondents were empowered in all the three categories used to measure empowerment in this study; 34% were empowered in two of the three categories, 29% were empowered in only one category while 9% of the women were not empowered in any of the categories. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds of empowered women using contraceptives was significantly higher than the odds of women who were not empowered.   Provision of economic interventions to empower and uplift conditions of women is needed to bring change in the economic status of their families and remove their dependence upon family members. This would make women in peri-urban Kumasi economically independent in making contraceptive choices and decisions, which would help in the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals: One (to end poverty in all its forms everywhere) and Five (to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls)."

Pilcher,Alex Welte,Brian Rice,Gary Murphy",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,53,363,"New challenges for diagnosis of HIV infection abound, including the impact on key viral and immunological markers of HIV vaccine studies, pre-exposure prophylaxis usage and breakthrough infections, and very early initiation of anti-retroviral treatment. These challenges impact the performance of current diagnostic assays, and require suitable specimens for development and evaluation. In this article we review and describe an archive developed by the Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA), in order to identify the critical features required to create a centralized specimen archive to support these current and future developments.    We review and describe the CEPHIA repository, a large, consolidated repository comprised of over 31,000 highly-selected plasma samples and other body fluid specimen types, with over 50 purposely designed specimen panels distributed to 19 groups since 2012. The CEPHIA repository provided financial return on investment, supported the standardization of HIV incidence assays, and informed guidance and standards set by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. Unified data from extensively characterized specimens has allowed this resource to support biomarker discovery, assay optimization, and development of new strategies for estimating duration of HIV infection. Critical features of a high-value repository include 1) extensively-characterized samples, 2) high-quality clinical background data, 3) multiple collaborations facilitating ongoing sample replenishment, and 4) sustained history of high-level specimen utilization.    With strong governance and leadership, a large consolidated archive of samples from multiple studies provides investigators and assay developers with easy access to diverse samples designed to address challenges associated with HIV diagnosis, helping to enable improvements to HIV diagnostic assays and ultimately elimination of HIV. Its creation and ongoing utilization should compel funders, institutions and researchers to address and improve upon current approaches to sharing specimens."

We reviewed autopsy findings in SSA to observe whether the prevalence of 14 AIDS-defining illnesses changed from the pre-ART era to the post-ART era.    We conducted a systematic review of autopsy findings in SSA using Medline, CINAHL, Evidence Based Medicine, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and abstracts from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, for literature published between January 1, 1990 and September 30, 2018. We focused on 14 AIDS-defining illnesses as causes of death.   In total, 33 studies were identified, including 9 from South Africa, 4 from the Ivory Coast, and the rest from eastern regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Of these, 18 studies were included in the meta-analyses for each of the AIDS-defining illnesses for adults. A ‘mixed group’ of studies that included adults and children was used for separate meta-analyses. Most opportunistic infections (OIs) showed a decrease in prevalence, with the notable exception of tuberculosis (TB), which showed a 13% increase in adult deaths and a 5% increase in mixed population group deaths. Kaposi’s sarcoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma both showed a notable increase in prevalence, and liver disease showed a 10% increase in prevalence in the adult group.    Even though ART has reduced the contribution of OIs to causes of death for people infected with HIV in SSA, targeted and strategic efforts are needed in order to strengthen existing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TB. More research is required to understand the complex role ARTs have on liver and kidney diseases."

The surgical techniques recommended to perform the two steps of the vasectomy procedure (isolation/exposition and occlusion of the vas deferens) were extracted from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Documents describing male sterilisation standards and practice from Kenya, Rwanda, India, Nepal, Mexico, Honduras, Colombia and Haiti were reviewed to assess adequacy with international guideline recommendations.   Best recommended techniques are 1) a minimally invasive technique including the no-scalpel technique (known as the no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV)) to isolate and expose the vas deferens, and 2) cautery of the mucosa of the vas preferably combined with interposition of the fascia (FI) to occlude the vas deferens. The NSV is largely adopted and performed to isolate the vas in selected low-resources countries. Ligation and excision (LE) of a small segment of the vas deferens combined with FI is the most common vas occlusion technique mentioned in the country standards. Cautery as recommended in the guidelines is seldom used in selected countries.     Effective and adapted vasectomy vas occlusion techniques are available, but are still underused in many low-resource countries. Providing the most effective vasectomy surgical techniques increases users’ confidence and satisfaction regarding male sterilization and may lead to higher acceptability and uptake."

The objective of the paper is to present providers’ perspectives on delivering a GE-focused FP intervention, CHARM, to married couples in rural India.     In-depth interviews were carried out with 22 male village health care providers who were delivering a GE-focused FP intervention, CHARM, to 428 husbands (247 couples) rural Maharashtra, India. Providers were interviewed on their experiences and perspectives during delivery of CHARM. Major domains were identified during a thematic analysis.    Local male health providers are interested and can be engaged in delivering a GE-focused FP intervention. Providers believed that the CHARM intervention improves couples’ communication, contraceptive use and strengthened their own capacity to provide FP services in accordance with national FP programmatic efforts. Providers found the low-tech flipchart including pictures and information helpful in supporting their service provision. Providers reported some challenges including lack of privacy and space for counselling, limited access to contraceptive options beyond pill and condom, numerous myths and misconceptions about contraceptives. Providers also reported persistent social norms related to expectancy of pregnancy early in marriage, and son preference.    Providers in rural areas with high fertility and related maternal health complications are interested in and can successfully implement a GE-focused FP intervention. Future efforts using this approach may benefit from greater focus to support broader array of spacing contraceptives particularly among first time parents, none or one child parents. There is a need to better support engagement of wives possibly through female provider led sessions parallel to male programs, i.e. gender synchronized rather than couples’ sessions.     : ClinicalTrials.gov  , May 8, 2012."

We recruit pregnant women from district health centers and the WNH and offer ultrasound examination to determine eligibility. Participants receive routine obstetrical care, lab testing, midtrimester cervical length measurement, and serial fetal growth monitoring. At delivery, we assess gestational age, birthweight, vital status, and sex and assign a delivery phenotype. We collect blood, urine, and vaginal swab specimens at scheduled visits and store them in an on-site biorepository. In September 2017, enrollment of the ZAPPS Phase 1—the subject of this report—was completed. Phase 2, which is limited to HIV-uninfected women, reopened in January 2018.    Between August 2015 and September 2017, we screened 1784 women, of whom 1450 (81.2%) met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The median age at enrollment was 27 years (IQR 23–32) and median gestational age was 16 weeks (IQR 13–18).

Screening existing registered pesticides, predominantly those developed for use in agriculture, may provide a more rapid and less logistically challenging route to identifying active ingredients of value to public health than screening and chemical synthesis programmes for novel compounds.    Insecticides and acaricides from all IRAC classes, including those with unclassified modes of action, were assessed for inclusion in a laboratory bioassay testing cascade against adult female   mosquitoes. A longlist of representative candidate compounds was selected, excluding those with safety concerns, unsuitable physiochemical properties, and likely hurdles to registration for public health use.  An initial screen using topical application eliminated compounds with insufficient intrinsic activity, and a tarsal contact assay identified those with activity at an appropriate concentration. Compounds of interest were ranked by relative potency using dose response assays and discriminating dose calculations.    Inclusion of an adjuvant enhanced the tarsal efficacy of several compounds, facilitating the promotion of chemistries with great potential, given suitable formulation, which would not progress based on activity of compound alone. Comparison of data between stages in the testing cascade suggest that a more streamlined approach, topical application to test for intrinsic activity and determining the discriminating dose to compare relative potency of compounds, may be sufficient to identify compounds with potential value for use in long lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spray products.    Identified were 11 compounds of interest as vector control agents (in descending order of potency): clothianidin, spinetoram, metaflumizone, dinotefuran, indoxacarb, abamectin, sulfoxaflor, oxazosulfyl, triflumezopyrim, fenpyroximate, and tolfenpyrad."

Data collectors visited each of the facilities and collected data through a pre-programmed smartphone. Frequencies of selected indicators were calculated by province and facility type—general referral hospital (GRH) and primary health centers (HC).   Facility conditions varied across province and facility type. Maternity wards and delivery rooms were available in the highest frequency of rooms assessed (>95% of all facilities). Drinking water was available in 25.0% of all facilities; electricity was available in 49.2% of labor rooms and 67.6% of delivery rooms in all facilities. Antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care services were available but varied across facilities. While the proportion of blood pressure measured during antenatal care was high (94.9%), the antenatal screening rate for proteinuria was low (14.7%). The use of uterotonics immediately after birth was observed in high numbers across both provinces (94.4% in Kwango and 75.6% in Kwilu) and facility type (91.3% in GRH and 81.4% in HC). The provision of immediate postnatal care to mothers every 15 minutes was provided in less than 50% of all facilities. GRH facilities generally had higher frequencies of available equipment and more services available than HC. GRH facilities provided an average of 6 EmONC signal functions (range: 2-9).   Despite poor facility conditions and a lack of supplies, GRH and HC facilities were able to provide EmONC care in rural DRC. These findings could guide the provision of essential needs to the health facilities for better delivery of maternal and neonatal care."

This study projected FP’s benefits for maternal health and child survival over the Sustainable Development Goals period.   : The Demographic Dividend Model created by the Health Policy Project using a large range of data was applied based exclusively on assumptions on FP policy options between 2015 and 2030.   : It was found that, under the base scenario with no improvements in FP, education and economic variables, however unrealistic, the number of children per Beninese woman would be the same in 2030 as it was in 2015 – about 4.5 children per woman. Benin’s age structure would remain very young and be dominated by dependents. But, FP–scenarios of improvements in contraceptive variables alone showed a negative and linear relationship between FP use and maternal and child deaths. Under the optimistic scenario, increasing access to and use of FP alone from 7.9% (2015) to 33.95% (2030) will save lives of about 200,000 under five year children and 10,000 mothers by 2030. In addition, the average number of children per woman will fall to 3.5 increasing female life expectancy by 5 years. Benin’s age structure will be balanced with more working age people. The country will also record an increase in its human development indicator.   : To accelerate progresses towards improvement of maternal health and child survival, and get on track in meeting related health targets of SDGs, the present study revealed the importance of strengthening actions toward access to and use of FP in Benin Republic. There is also a need to strengthen education and economic policies to successfully harness the demographic dividend."

In this article we introduce a simple intuitive open-source browser-based clinical trial simulator for planning adaptive and platform trials. The software application is implemented in  and features a graphical user interface that allows the user to set key clinical trial parameters and explore multiple scenarios such as varying treatment effects, control response and adherence, as well as number of interim looks and adaptation rules. The software provides simulation options for a number of designs such as dropping treatment arms for futility, adding a new treatment arm (i.e., platform design), and stopping a trial early based on superiority. All available adaptations are based on underlying Bayesian probabilities. The software comes with a number of graphical outputs to examine properties of individual simulated trials. The main output is a comparison of trial design performance across several simulations, graphically summarizing type I error (false positive risk), power, and expected cost/time to completion of the considered designs.   We have developed and validated an intuitive highly efficient clinical trial simulator for planning of clinical trials. The software is open-source and caters to clinical trial investigators who do not have the statistical capacity for trial simulations available in their team.

However, local health facilities are often under-resourced and lack technical capacity that feed into the larger supply chain. This study’s objective was to assess whether changes in facility CS indicators were associated with participation in 2014-2016 implementation and scale-up of a quality improvement methodology—Client-Oriented, Provider efficient services (COPE®) for Contraceptive Security—in 60 facilities across 10 districts of Malawi. The intervention included facility self-assessment guides and action plans to address local challenges.  Results showed significant improvements in facilities having   a trained provider and contraceptive supplies. The percentage of health centers with all requirements for implant services increased significantly, including implant removal (from 26.5%; 95% CI: 14.9-41.1 to 77.6%; 95% CI: 63.4-88.2, p<.001). Health centers (from 0.0%; 95% CI: 0.0-7.3 to 10.2%; 95% CI: 3.4-22.2, p<0.05) and hospitals (from 45.5%; 95% CI: 16.7-76.7 to 90.9%; 95% CI: 58.7-99.8, p<0.05) significantly improved in the percentage of facilities able to insert intrauterine devices. Hospitals improved their ability to offer female sterilizations (27.2%; 95% CI: 6.0-61.0 to 63.6%; 95% CI: 30.7-89.1, p<0.05) and male sterilizations. Low performing health centers showed significant improvement in staff capacity, logistics management information systems, equipment, and total CS performance. The percentage of facilities placing emergency orders for contraceptives during the three months prior to an assessment showed a decreasing, non-significant trend among hospitals but was significant among health centers (from 69.2%; 95% CI: 54.6-81.7 to 36.7%; 95% CI: 23.4-51.7; p<0.001). Facility staff commitment was associated with action item completion. Improvements tended to be sustained over time. Community engagement is thought to be important to intervention success.  COPE for CS may be an effective intervention and future research/programs can build off of this preliminary programmatic experience when seeking to address last mile challenges."

This nuanced understanding can inform programmatic direction for countries especially in need.     Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from the two most recent surveys of ten study countries—five countries that have not yet experienced a fertility transition (“pre-transitional”) and five countries that began the fertility transition but stalled (“transitional”)—we explore trends in reasons for non-use.    We find that that reasons for non-use are changing. Specifically, in pre-transition study countries, women are increasingly citing attitudes opposing contraception as reasons for non-use.  In transition countries, women are increasingly citing reasons related to service quality and method side effects. Perceived low fecundability is increasingly cited among both pre-transition and transition study countries. Geographical access and cost are not prominent frequently cited at either time point.     These findings highlight the need for prioritized programmatic attention aimed at: reducing opposition to contraception in pre-transitional countries; improving service quality and addressing issues of side-effects, both experienced and perceived, in transitional countries; and addressing fecundability perceptions in both types of country contexts.  We remind policy makers that even in contexts of fertility stagnation, underlying attitudes, norms, and barriers to contraceptive uptake are shifting.  Lack of change at the population-level can mask important changes at the individual-level that must be accounted for in program development and implementation."

This review sought to understand how male engagement in FP is defined, identify gaps in M&E of male engagement and make recommendations.   We conducted key informant interviews and a desk review of peer-reviewed articles and gray literature, including national FP strategies and policies.  We then facilitated an online forum with experts in the field of male engagement in FP to provide feedback on our proposed indicators for male engagement in FP to reach consensus on and validate key indicators.   Although there is no universal definition of male engagement in FP, the most common definition is the inclusion of men in FP programming as FP clients, supportive partners, and agents of change. The most common approach was engaging men as clients exclusively, followed by engaging men as partners. Few papers reported on programs that engaged men across the full spectrum of the definition. There’s significant variation in the degree to which male engagement in FP is included in M&E, planning, and approaches. Few programs reported findings disaggregated by sex and by contraceptive method, making it difficult to determine the effect of programming on male use of methods. There is a dearth of indicators for measuring male engagement in FP in national strategies and policies. Other gaps are a lack of core indicators for male engagement, qualitative indicators, and indicator reference sheets for many commonly used indicators. Among over 100 indicators being used to monitor and evaluate male engagement in FP, 15 key indicators were identified and validated, with accompanying guidance.   As programming for male engagement in FP increases, coordinated efforts should be made to improve the systems that collect, analyze, and use data."

This article draws on research completed by the EngenderHealth’s   project in three urban areas of Togo on the extent to which monitoring and evaluation systems of health services, which operated within the   project area in Togo, captured integrated family planning services.    This mixed methods case study used 25 health facility assessments with health service record review in hospitals, large community clinics, a dispensary, and private clinics and 41 key informant interviews with health faculty, individuals working at reproductive health organizations, individuals involved in reproductive health policy and politics, health care workers, and health facility directors.    The study found the reporting system for health care was labor intensive and involved multiple steps for health care workers. The system lacked a standardized method to record family planning services as part of other health care at the patient level, yet the Ministry of Health required integrated family planning services to be reported on district and partner organization reporting forms. Key informants suggested improving the system by using computer-based monitoring, streamlining the reporting process to include all necessary information at the patient level, and standardizing what information is needed for the Ministry of Health and partner organizations.    Future research should focus on assessing the best methods for recording integrated health services and task shifting of reporting. Recommendations for future policy and programming include consolidating data for reproductive health indicators, ensuring type of information needed is captured at all levels, and reducing provider workload for reporting."

Education and place of residence have been cited as factors affecting modern contraceptive use.   We investigated the separate and joint effects of the place of residence and education on the time to modern contraceptive uptake among women aged 15-24 in Niger. The study used data from the second round of the 2016 Niger Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) project. Survival analysis was applied for 830 women.   Nelson-Aalen curves show that urban women had higher hazards of (and shorter delays in) modern contraceptive uptake as compared to their rural counterparts. Also, the higher the level of education, the higher the hazards of (and the shorter the delays in) modern contraceptive uptake. Findings from the multivariate (survival) analysis confirms these figures and provides the net effect of the place of residence on modern contraceptive uptake. Whether living in urban or rural areas of Niger, what matters more is the level of education.   : Family planning programmes concerning adolescent and young women should focus more on women with no education and those that are illiterate."

Assessing state-level prospects of achieving 2030 sustainable development goals for neonatal and under-five mortality,"Osondu Ogbuoji,Gavin Yamey",,69,790,"Nigeria’s neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-five mortality rate (U5MR) are 39 per 1,000 and 120 per 1,000 live births, respectively. On average, 0.23 million neonates and 0.7 million under-five children die every year, but some states contribute more to this burden than others. If the country is to meet its sustainable development goal (SDG) targets for NMR and U5MR, it needs to make progress at both the national and subnational levels.    Using the 2016-2017 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), we estimated state-level neonatal and under-five mortality rates.  Next, we estimated how long it would take for each state to reach the SDG targets for NMR and U5MR. Finally, we estimated the average number of neonatal and under-five deaths that could be averted between 2018 and 2030 in each state under different scenarios.    At current average annual rates of decline, Nigeria is unlikely to meet both sustainable development goals targets for NMR and U5MR. At the subnational level, some states are close to or have met both NMR and U5MR targets, while others are projected to meet the targets as late as 2088 (58 years delayed). Between 850,000 and 1.89 million neonatal deaths could be averted between 2018 and 2030, while 3.1 million to 5.96 million under-five deaths could be averted over the same period.    Nigeria has the potential to achieve its SDG targets for NMR and U5MR, and in the process avert millions of preventable child deaths. But this will not happen under a business-as-usual approach. The NMR and U5MR trajectories achieved by high-performing states is evidence that achieving these SDG targets is possible. For the country to achieve positive results nationally, systems that encourage peer learning and transfer of technical expertise between states are needed."

This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted in eight urban districts in and around Dakar and two urban districts outside of Dakar employing an audit of 225 pharmacies, a survey with 486 private sector pharmacy staff and a survey with 3,567 women exiting private sector pharmacies.    Most (54%) pharmacies reported offering method-specific counseling to clients. Family planning  commodities were available in all pharmacies, and 72% had a private space available to offer counseling. Three quarters (76%) did not have any counseling materials available.  49% of pharmacists and 47% of assistant pharmacists reported receiving training on family planning during their professional studies. Half had received counseling training. Few pharmacists met pre-determined criteria to be considered highly knowledgeable of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and injectable contraceptive provision (0.6% and 1.1%).  Overall, 60% of women surveyed were current family planning users and 11% procured their method through a private sector pharmacy. Among non-users of family planning, and current users who did not obtain their method through a pharmacy, 47% said they would be interested in procuring a method through a private sector pharmacy.    There is both actual and latent demand for accessing family planning through Senegal’s urban, private sector pharmacies. With proper training, pharmacy staff could better provide effective counseling and provision of OCPs and injectables, and lifting the requirement for a prescription could help support gains in contraceptive prevalence."

MacQuarrie,Christina Juan",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,137,925,"Child marriage, defined as marriage before the age of 18, is a human rights violation and is associated with numerous adverse health, social, and economic outcomes.  As such, the phenomena of child marriage garners substantial programmatic and policy action.   However, a better understanding of specifically how child marriage is or is not changing is needed.    This study analyzes trends in the age structure of child marriage with cumulative incidence functions using data from Demographic and Health Surveys in four Asian countries.  It further uses equiplots and chi-square tests of independence to identify specific patterns of and trends in inequalities of child marriage across three socio-economic factors: education, wealth, and residence.    We find significant decreases in child marriage in all four countries since the 1990s.  The rate of change has been unevenly paced, with rapid increases in age at marriage followed by periods of little observable change.  Child marriage generally falls first during the youngest ages, followed by decreases in marriage later in adolescence.  Marriage remains an adolescent experience for the majority of women in Bangladesh and Nepal.  Child marriage is most common in Bangladesh and least common in Indonesia, while India has experienced the largest declines in child marriage.  There is no discernible trend toward non-marriage, but rather a trend toward delayed marriage only. We find widespread education-, wealth-, and residence-based inequalities, with child marriage concentrated among more disadvantaged groups.  Inequalities based on education are wider than either those based on wealth or residence.  Inequalities have mostly lessened over the previous decade, except in Nepal.  A pattern of mass deprivation is observed with regard to education, while wealth-based inequalities follow a queuing pattern.     These inequality patterns suggest delayed marriage be broadly promoted, alongside targeted interventions directed to the most disadvantaged groups."

A low-dose, high-frequency (LDHF) training approach was introduced in 40 hospitals in Ghana to improve newborn survival. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore healthcare workers’ experiences with the LDHF approach to in-service training.   A total of 20 in-depth interviews and nine focus group discussions were conducted in 2016 in three regions of Ghana with healthcare workers who participated in implementation of the LDHF training approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 master mentors and peer practice coordinators; 51 practicing doctors, midwives and nurses participated in focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.   Healthcare workers reflected on the differences between the LDHF approach and past learning experiences, highlighting how the skills-based team training approach, coupled with high-frequency practice and mobile mentoring, built their competency and confidence. As participants shared their experiences, they highlighted relationships established between Master Mentors and healthcare workers, and motivation stemming from pride in contributing to reductions in maternal and newborn deaths as critical factors in improving quality of care at participating health facilities.   This nested qualitative study documents experiences of healthcare workers and mentors involved in implementation of a multi-faceted intervention that effectively improved maternal and newborn care at health facilities in Ghana. The way the intervention was implemented created an environment conducive to learning within the hospital setting, thus providing an opportunity for professional growth and quality improvement for all staff working in the maternity ward."

Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of  , a free sexual and reproductive health information service.    : We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats.    : Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to   and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common.    : Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy.

Although the unmet need for contraception for Women of Child Bearing Age (WCBA) in Nigeria is 12.7%, the value is higher (35.3%) among adolescents aged 15 – 19 years. Additionally, the unmet need for family planning (FP) among WCBA in Kaduna state is 5.8%, with 33.3% of women aged 20-24 years in Kaduna reported to have had a live birth before the age of 18 years. This study sought to evaluate adolescent contraceptive use in three referral health facilities of Kaduna metropolis.    This is a descriptive cross-sectional desk review of 5543 FP clients that attended three referral centers between 2014 and 2016. Data on their age, parity and the use of contraceptives were collected from the clinic registers and analyzed using SPSS 22.   The FP client age ranged from 12 to 57 years, of which only 3.6% were adolescent. The annual proportion of adolescent contraceptive users ranged from 3.1 – 4.1%. More than 96% of the adolescents had given birth to at least one child. Around 62% of the adolescents used injectable contraceptives but there was no IUD use reported by any adolescent.   The low proportion of adolescent contraceptive users and their limited choice of contraceptive methods, emanating from multiplicity of client and provider bias, calls for innovative interventions to meet the contraceptive needs of adolescents."

Consequently, little is known about its impact on male involvement in reproductive health. This paper examined the socio-demographic, economic and proximate predictors of age at first child’s birth among men aged 15-54 years in Uganda.   We used the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) on a sample of 3,206 men aged 15-54 years who had a biological child.  The outcome variable was age at first childbirth categorized as: below 17, 18-24 and 25 years and above (25+). Analysis was done using descriptive statistics,  un-adjusted and adjusted multinomial regressions with significance level at 95%.   Median age at first child’s birth was 22 years (IQR = 20-25). The majority of men (62.4%) had fatherhood onset between 18 and 24 years. Only 5.2% had fatherhood onset at 17 years or earlier, increasing to 32.4% at 25+. Respondents whose first sexual encounter was before 18 years was 44.3% and 92.7% by 24+. Few respondents (44.1%) reported use of any contraceptive methods. Anglican religion (RRR=1.62; CI 1.06 – 2.46) or not having attended school (RRR=2.20; CI 1.02-4.71) were predictors of childbirth onset before 17 years.  Age of sex debut at 18 years or higher (RRR= 2.09, CI 1.72 – 2.54) and secondary and above education (RRR = 1.76, CI 1.42-2.18) were predictors of fatherhood onset at 25+.  Contraceptive use among men had no association with age at first child’s birth.   These findings are important for strategic allocation of resources to curb early onset of fatherhood among adolescent and young men under the age of 25 years. They highlight the need for gender-sensitive interventions targeting men for behavioral change, participation in Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) programming and improved access to services delivery."

Dadzie,Dziedzom  K. de Souza",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,77,691,"Monitoring vector-borne diseases requires sampling of very large numbers of disease vectors in order to corroborate infections in the human population. This can be challenging, as current vector collection tools are either inefficient, or expensive to implement from a public health perspective. To circumvent this challenge, this study compared a community vector collection strategy using a double-netted mosquito collection method (a tent trap (TT)) to the traditional human landing collection (HLC) method in three communities in lymphatic filariasis-endemic districts in Ghana.    Following community entry and sensitization, community volunteers appointed by the community leaders were trained in the mosquito collection and storage methods and provided with supplies for mosquito collection over a 7-month period. They were visited occasionally by the study team to retrieve the mosquito samples for identification. The collectors were also assessed to evaluate their perspectives on using community vector collectors for monitoring vector-borne diseases.    The results of the study indicated that the TT method collected significantly more mosquitoes (63%) over the collection period than HLC (37%). Thus, the TTs were observed to be performing relatively better than the HLC ( <0.001). The collectors knew the importance of mosquitoes in transmitting diseases, could identify the main diseases that were locally transmitted within their communities. They appreciated the involvement of the community in the collection as this enhanced community ownership of the programme as well as providing some financial incentives to those directly involved in the collection.    The study revealed that use of community volunteers for the collection of mosquitoes for xenomonitoring purposes can be a viable strategy in the monitoring of vector-borne diseases. However, further development of the strategies and assessments of the costs involved will be required to make this a sustainable approach to monitoring vector-borne disease interventions and enhance community ownership of the programmes."

Viswanath,Christina Synowiec,Sohail Agha",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,249,2359,"The current dominant models of intervention design in the development sector do not account for the complexity and unpredictability of implementation challenges. Decision makers and implementers need timely feedback during implementation to respond to field realities and to course-correct. This letter calls for a new approach of “responsive feedback” or “feedback loops” that promotes interactions between project designers, implementers, researchers and decision-makers to enable course corrections needed to achieve intended outcomes. A responsive feedback approach, in theory, should be agile, flexible, adaptive, iterative, and actionable. There can be multiple challenges associated with incorporating this approach into practice including donor requirements, organizational structure and culture, concerns about the additional time required to adopt such an approach, resource and operational constraints, the absence of skill sets needed for such an approach within smaller organizations and inadequate inter-departmental communication. However, these barriers to adaptation can be overcome. For responsive feedback to become a part of the culture of development organizations, commitment is needed from donors, decision-makers, project designers and implementers. We believe that, to generate opportunities for learning and adaptation, donors should provide the stimulus to break down silos between implementers and researchers."

Therefore, the Pneumonia Etiology Among Refugees and the Lebanese population (PEARL) study was initiated with the objective of identifying the causal pathogenic microorganisms in the respiratory tract of children and adults from both the refugee and host country population presenting with signs of CAP during a humanitarian crisis.   PEARL, a prospective, multicentric, case-control study, will be conducted at four primary healthcare facilities in Tripoli and the Bekaa valley over 15 months (including two high-transmission seasons/winters). Sociodemographic and medical data, and biological samples will be collected from at least 600 CAP cases and 600 controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, urine and blood samples will be analyzed at five clinical pathology laboratories in Lebanon to identify the bacterial and viral etiological agents of CAP. Transcriptomic profiling of host leukocytes will be performed.    PEARL is an original observational study that will provide important new information on the etiology of pneumonia among refugees, which may improve case management, help design antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and reduce morbidity and mortality due to CAP in a humanitarian crisis."

Here we describe the rationale and design of the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of an innovative nano iron supplement, iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT), for the treatment of IDA in young children (IHAT-GUT trial). Oral iron is often ineffective due to poor absorption and/or gastrointestinal adverse effects. IHAT is novel since it is effectively absorbed whilst remaining nanoparticulate in the gut, therefore should enable supplementation with fewer symptoms.    IHAT-GUT is a three-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial conducted in Gambian children 6-35 months of age. The intervention consists of a 12-week supplementation with either IHAT, ferrous sulphate (both at doses bioequivalent to 12.5 mg  /day) or placebo. The trial aims to include 705 children with IDA who will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm. The primary objectives are to test non-inferiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate at treating IDA, and to test superiority of IHAT in relation to ferrous sulphate and non-inferiority in relation to placebo in terms of diarrhoea incidence and prevalence. Secondary objectives are mechanistic assessments, to test whether IHAT reduces the burden of enteric pathogens, morbidity, and intestinal inflammation, and that it does not cause detrimental changes to the gut microbiome, particularly in relation to  ,   and  .   This trial will test the hypothesis that supplementation with IHAT eliminates iron deficiency and improves haemoglobin levels without inducing gastrointestinal adverse effects. If shown to be the case, this would open the possibility for further testing and use of IHAT as a novel iron source for micronutrient intervention strategies in resource-poor countries, with the ultimate aim to help reduce the IDA global burden.

Given the high poverty levels and the intense levels of malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, suppressing malaria in rural agricultural communities in these regions will be one of the greatest challenges to achieving malaria eradication. This study has two objectives. The first is to estimate how eradicating malaria by 2040 would affect agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. The second is to identify where additional research is needed to develop better estimates of how eradicating malaria by 2040 would affect those households.   : Using agricultural census data and malaria morbidity data, we developed estimates of the number of malaria cases in 2018 among agricultural households with fewer than 10 hectares of land for 35 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By combining these estimates with additional evidence from the literature, we analyzed how achieving malaria eradication by 2040 would affect indicators related to four Sustainable Development Goals: health, poverty, education and gender equality.   : Our analysis found that achieving malaria eradication by 2040 would prevent approximately 841 million cases of malaria and thereby decrease the number of lost workdays among agricultural households by approximately 3.2 billion days. Eradicating malaria by 2040 would also increase the number of school days attended by children by 1.5 billion days while also reducing the number of caregiving days provided by women for malaria cases by approximately 1.1 billion days.   : This article analyzes the impact of eradicating malaria among agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa using indicators related to four of the Sustainable Development Goals. Enhanced data collection efforts related to these four indicators would facilitate more rigorous estimates of how eradicating malaria would affect these indicators over the next two decades."

Despite recognition and interest, the gaps in evidence in this field of research and practice in low- and middle-income countries remain poorly characterized. This study will develop an evidence gap map in the area of performance management in primary care delivery systems in low- and middle-income countries.    The evidence gap map will follow the methodology developed by 3Ie, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, to systematically map evidence and research gaps. The process starts with the development of the scope by creating an evidence-informed framework that helps identify the interventions and outcomes of relevance as well as help define inclusion and exclusion criteria. A search strategy is then developed to guide the systematic search of the literature, covering the following databases: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CAB Global Health (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Cochrane Library, Scopus (Elsevier), and Econlit (Ovid). Sources of grey literature are also searched. Studies that meet the inclusion criteria are systematically coded, extracting data on intervention, outcome, measures, context, geography, equity, and study design. Systematic reviews are also critically appraised using an existing standard checklist. Impact evaluations are not appraised but will be coded according to study design. The process of map-building ends with the creation of an evidence gap map graphic that displays the available evidence according to the intervention and outcome framework of interest.   Implications arising from the evidence map will be discussed in a separate paper that will summarize findings and make recommendations for the development of a prioritized research agenda."

Interventions like performance measurement and team-based, in-kind incentives foster motivation among individual members of high-performing teams, which may be moderated by working conditions, supervision practices, and by the stress exerted by the interventions themselves. Individuals report a strong sense of public service motivation and an overarching sense of commitment to the community they serve. At the interpersonal level, the linkage between performance measurement and in-kind incentives triggers a sense of collective efficacy and increases team motivation and improvement behaviors. The convening of learning forums and performance dialogue increases the stakes for high-performing teams, helps them make sense of performance data, and leads to performance information utilization for healthcare improvements. Closeness to communities creates strong emotional linkages among team members that further increases collective efficacy and social identity. Such changes in individuals, team, and organizational behaviors can contribute to improved delivery of primary care services and explain the gains in performance demonstrated by the program.    This case suggests that primary care systems that rely on multi-disciplinary teams for the provision of care can benefit from performance measurement and management interventions that leverage individual and team-level motivation. Realist evaluation can help prioritize policy-relevant research and enhance the design and evaluation of large-scale performance reforms in primary care systems in low- and middle-income settings."

Smith,Donal Bisanzio",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,105,888,"Heterogeneity in malaria transmission has household, temporal, and spatial components. These factors are relevant for improving the efficiency of malaria control by targeting heterogeneity. To quantify variation, we analyzed mosquito counts from entomological surveillance conducted at three study sites in Uganda that varied in malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting or exposure is a risk factor for malaria transmission.    Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria vector density and examined its spatial distribution. We introduced a novel approach for identifying changes in vector abundance hotspots over time by computing the Getis-Ord statistic on ratios of household biting propensities for different scenarios. We also explored the association of household biting propensities with housing and environmental covariates.    In each site, there was evidence for hot and cold spots of vector abundance, and spatial patterns associated with urbanicity, elevation, or other environmental covariates. We found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after the application of control interventions. Housing quality explained a portion of the variation among households in mosquito counts.   This work provided an improved understanding of heterogeneity in malaria vector density at the three study sites in Uganda and offered a valuable opportunity for assessing whether interventions could be spatially targeted to be aimed at abundance hotspots which may increase malaria risk. Indoor residual spraying was shown to be a successful measure of vector control interventions in Tororo, Uganda.  Cement walls, brick floors, closed eaves, screened airbricks, and tiled roofs were features of a house that had shown reduction of household biting propensity. Improvements in house quality should be recommended as a supplementary measure for malaria control reducing risk of infection."

Vanderbilt,Beth A. Smith",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,64,597,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive tool that has the potential to identify and quantify atypical brain development. We introduce a new measure here, variance of relative power of resting-state EEG. We sought to assess whether variance of relative power of resting-state EEG could predict i) classification of infants as typical development (TD) or at risk (AR) for developmental disability, and ii) Bayley developmental scores at the same visit or future visits.    A total of 22 infants with TD participated, aged between 38 and 203 days. In addition, 11 infants broadly at risk participated (6 high-risk pre-term, 4 low-risk pre-term, 1 high-risk full-term), aged between 40 and 225 days of age (adjusted for prematurity). We used EEG to measure resting-state brain function across months. We calculated variance of relative power as the standard deviation of the relative power across each of the 32 EEG electrodes. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (3  edition) was used to measure developmental level. Infants were measured 1-6 times each, with 1 month between measurements.    Our main findings were: i) variance of relative power of resting state EEG can predict classification of infants as TD or AR, and ii) variance of relative power of resting state EEG can predict Bayley developmental scores at the same visit (Bayley raw fine motor, Bayley raw cognitive, Bayley total raw score, Bayley motor composite score) and at a future visit (Bayley raw fine motor).    This was a preliminary, exploratory, small study. Our results support variance of relative power of resting state EEG as an area of interest for future study as a biomarker of neurodevelopmental status and as a potential outcome measure for early intervention."
https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/2-70,04 Oct 2018,An extension of the Alma-Ata vision for primary health care in light of twenty-first century evidence and realities,Henry B. Perry,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,92,683,"This paper builds upon and extends the definition of primary health care in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. The definition proposes a stronger role for community-based delivery of services and community mobilization, participation and empowerment. It calls for a stronger integration with vertical, disease-specific programs. And, finally, it calls for a strong role for certain curative services (including basic and essential surgery) that many today would not consider as part of primary health care. There is growing evidence that communities can and should play a stronger role than has traditionally been the case, that community-level workers who are properly trained and supported can provide effective services outside of health facilities, and that primary health centers staffed with non-specialist physicians and even non-physician clinicians can perform many of the lower-level inpatient services now performed at first-level referral hospitals.  An approach to primary health care that is appropriate to the local context and that merges local epidemiological priorities with the communities' perceived priorities will make it possible to engage communities as partners. Currently, essential and basic health care services are available to only one-half of the world’s population. The full development of primary health care as envisioned here will accelerate progress in achieving Health for All as envisioned at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 1978."

Willis,Nick Hamon",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,92,847,": Progress in suppressing malaria over the next two decades may have a significant impact on poverty among agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent study found that if malaria were eradicated by 2040, poverty rates among such households would fall by 4 to 26 percentage points more from 2018 to 2040 than if the burden of malaria remained at its current level. The relatively wide range of these estimates is due to a lack of evidence regarding the long-term impact of suppressing malaria on the incomes of agricultural households. The objective of this study is to describe a research framework that would generate the necessary evidence for developing more precise estimates.   : First, we developed a conceptual framework for understanding the potential long-term impact of suppressing malaria on the incomes of agricultural households. Next, we established a research framework for examining each component of the conceptual framework.   : Our proposed research framework enables a comprehensive examination of how malaria affects the decisions, productivity, harvest value and expenditures due to morbidity and mortality within an agricultural household. This contrasts with the 27 existing relevant studies that we have identified, of which 23 focused only on household productivity and expenditures, two focused on decisions, and two focused on harvest values.   : By implementing the research framework presented in this study, we will increase our knowledge of how suppressing malaria over the next two decades would affect the incomes of agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence generated from the framework will inform funding allocation decisions for malaria elimination initiatives."

Our objective is to examine how achieving that goal would affect poverty rates of agricultural households.   : We analyzed the potential impact of eliminating malaria by 2040 on poverty rates among agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Our model used ten scenarios to examine how the impact of eliminating malaria by 2040 on households’ income would affect the number of individuals living on less than $1.90 (2011 PPP) per day.    : We analyzed ten scenarios for malaria’s impact on agricultural household income from 2018 to 2040 for the approximately 324 million individuals in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa in 2018. We found that approximately 53 million to 123 million individuals would escape poverty by 2040 if malaria were eliminated by that year. If the malaria burden in agricultural households remained at its current level through 2040, only 40 million individuals would escape poverty by 2040, a decrease of only 24%. Therefore, the impact of eliminating malaria by 2040, relative to the status quo scenario through 2040, is that approximately 13 million to 84 million individuals in agricultural households will escape poverty.    : The modeling analysis presented here is meant to be a starting point for additional research into the potential impact of eliminating malaria on the incomes of agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. This study could be strengthened with the application of new methods to examine malaria’s impact on the welfare of agricultural households. We recommend the collection and analysis of longitudinal data from agricultural households in future studies of malaria’s impact on these households."

Carolina Danovaro-Holliday",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,77,460,"The effect of immunization does not only depend on its completeness, but also on its timely administration. Routine childhood vaccinations schedules recommend that children receive the vaccine doses at specific ages. This article attempts to assess timeliness of routine vaccination coverage among a sub-sample of children from a survey conducted in 2016.    This analysis was based on data from a cross-sectional multistage cluster survey conducted between December 2015 and June 2016 among caregivers of children aged 12-59 months in all of Lebanon using a structured survey questionnaire. The analysis used Kaplan–Meier curves and logistic regression to identify the predictors of age-appropriate immunization.    Among the 493 randomly selected children, timely administration of the third dose of polio vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccine and hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine occurred in about one-quarter of children. About two-thirds of children received the second dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) within the age interval recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Several factors including socio-demographic, knowledge, beliefs and practices were found to be associated with age-appropriate vaccination; however, this association differed between the types and doses of vaccine. Important factors associated with timely vaccination included being Lebanese as opposed to Syrian and being born in a hospital for hepatitis B birth dose; believing that vaccination status was up-to-date was related to untimely vaccination.    The results suggest that there is reason for concern over the timeliness of vaccination in Lebanon. Special efforts need to be directed towards the inclusion of timeliness of vaccination as another indicator of the performance of the EPI in Lebanon."

LARC made up 65% of methods initiated through the outreach setting and 47% of those initiated through a fixed-site strategy. Continuation rates varied from 99% for intrauterine devices (IUDs) to 77% for injectables and were very similar between outreach and fixed-site strategies, with the exception of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Only 65% of outreach initiators continued using OCPs, compared to 84% of fixed-site initiators. Top reported reasons for discontinuation were side effects and little or no sexual relations.   Project interventions allowed most women to continue with their chosen method of FP for the seven-month duration of the study whether initiated through fixed site or outreach strategies, showing promise in helping Senegal to increase its CPR. It is feasible to offer both LARC and short acting methods through outreach strategies.  Further research into the sensitivity of demand to the price charged is needed."

A literature review,"Anabel Gomez,Rebecca Loar,Andrea England Kramer",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,149,1572,": The business world has long recognized the power of defining discrete audiences within a target population. However, market segmentation’s full potential has not been applied to the public health context. While some broad elements of market segmentation (e.g., age, geography) are considered, a nuanced look at behavioural and psychographic segmentation, which could greatly enhance the possibility of lasting behaviour change, is often missing.     , and the associated mindset which acknowledges the multi-dimensional differences between people, allows service providers, implementers, policymakers, and government officials to target initiatives and lead to a greater likelihood of lasting behavioural change.  This paper investigates what segmentation is, how it has been applied to voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), how it can be applied in development, and the challenges in both measuring and adopting segmentation as part of program design.   : We performed a detailed search of peer-reviewed literature using PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and the abstract directories of the International AIDS Society (IAS) published between January 2015 and September 2018. We also accessed articles from business databases such as the Harvard Business Review.     : Results from a VMMC-focused intervention that successfully designed and delivered segmentation-based programs in two countries demonstrated that it is possible to adapt private sector approaches. However, within the sector of global development that is most familiar with segmentation, these efforts rarely go beyond basic demographic segments.   : Existing published material tends not to measure the impact of segmentation itself, but the impact of the intervention to which segmentation was applied, which makes it challenging for the development sector to invest in the approach without evidence that it works. Nonetheless, the experiences of segmentation and demand creation for VMMC do highlight the opportunity for better integrating this approach in HIV prevention and in global development and measurement initiatives."

Chaloupka,Prabhat Jha",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,111,997,"Tobacco smoking remains a leading risk factor for disease burden globally. In India alone, about 1 million deaths are caused annually by smoking. Although increasing tobacco prices has consistently been found to be the most effective intervention to reduce tobacco use, the documentation of prices and taxes across time and space has not been an essential component of tobacco control surveillance in most jurisdictions. This study aimed to examine, using graphical methods, trends in smoking tobacco taxes and prices in India at national and state-level.    We used retail prices, price indices, and unit values (household expenditures on a commodity divided by the quantity purchased) collected and reported by government agencies. For bidis and cigarettes, we examined current and real (inflation-adjusted) prices, affordability (cost in terms of income), and key tax changes at both national and state-level.    We show that real prices of bidis and cigarettes were relatively flat (even decreasing in the case of bidis) between 2000 and 2007, and clearly increasing from 2010. When rising income is taken into account, however, both cigarettes and bidis have become more affordable since 2000. We found that some but not all tax changes were accompanied by price changes and in particular, that tax decreases did not result in price decreases.    It is feasible to evaluate tax and price policies at national and regional level using routinely collected data."

FHI 360 developed the Routine Efficiency Monitoring System (REMS)-a relational database leveraging existing budget, expenditure and output data to produce quarterly site-level estimates of unit expenditure per service.  Along with the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and implementation partner Avencion, we configured REMS to measure technical efficiency of Ministry of Health resources used to deliver HIV/AIDS services in 326 facilities in 17 high-priority districts in Copperbelt and Central Provinces.  REMS allocation algorithms were developed through facility assessments, and key informant interviews with MoH staff.  Existing IFMIS and DHIS-2 data streams provide recurring flows of expenditure and output data needed to estimate service-specific unit expenditures.  Trained users access REMS output through user-friendly dashboards delivered through a web-based application.    District health managers use REMS to identify “outlier” facilities to test performance improvement interventions.  Provincial and national planners are using REMS to seek savings and ensure that resources are directed to geographic and programmatic areas with highest need.  REMS can support reimbursement for social health insurance and provide time-series data on facility-level costs for modeling.   REMS gives managers and planners substantially-improved data on how programs transform resources into services.  The GRZ is seeking funding to expand REMS nationally, covering all major disease areas.  Improved technical efficiency supports the goal of a sustainable HIV/AIDS response."

Understanding how these two are linked and when each should be prioritized is difficult. The maximum contraceptive prevalence ‘demand curve’ was created based on a relationship between the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) and mean ideal number of children to allow for a quantitative assessment of the balance between access and demand interventions. The curve represents the maximum mCPR that is likely to be seen given fertility intentions and related norms and constructs that influence contraceptive use. The gap between a country’s mCPR and this maximum is referred to as the ‘potential use gap.’ This concept can be used by countries to prioritize access investments where the gap is large, and discuss implications for future contraceptive use where the gap is small. It is also used within the FP Goals model to ensure mCPR growth from access interventions does not exceed available demand."

The disease is currently targeted for elimination (annual incidence to less than one per 10,000 population) using indoor residual spraying, active case detection and treatment. Historically the disease trend in India has been regarded as cyclical with case resurgence characteristically occurring every 15 years.  Understanding this pattern is essential if the VL elimination gains are to be sustained. To better understand the cyclical trends, annual climatic indicators including rainfall, temperature and humidity over time were compared with annual VL case incidence data.    Annual climate data (rainfall, average and maximum temperature and specific humidity) from 1956-2004 were used to identify potential factors influencing VL incidence.  Months relevant to the VL life-cycle were identified and defined (Monsoon, Sand-fly Peak, Pre-Sand-fly Peak and Annual) for analysis. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to determine significant difference between categorical rainfall and VL incidence, whilst univariate negative binomial regression models were used to determine predictors of disease incidence.    The negative binomial regression model showed statistically significant associations (p <0.05) for VL incidence and maximum temperature, and average temperature, when considering annual and pre-sand fly peak time periods. No other associations between humidity, rainfall or temperature and VL incidence were detected (all values p >0.05).     The VL programme in Bihar has made significant progress in adopting best practices for improved treatment and vector control, with the aim to achieve VL elimination.  However, open access granular programme data for indoor residual spray activities and case detection is required to fully understand the role of climate in disease transmission and potential resurgence."

Many HDSS sites, however, are in areas that lack unique national identifiers or suffer from data quality issues, such as incomplete records, spelling errors, and name and residence changes, all of which complicate record linkage approaches when applied retrospectively. We developed Point-of-contact Interactive Record Linkage (PIRL) software that is used to prospectively link health records from a local health facility to an HDSS in rural Tanzania. This prospective approach to record linkage is carried out in the presence of the individual whose records are being linked, which has the advantage that any uncertainty surrounding their identity can be resolved during a brief interaction, whereby extraneous information (e.g., household membership) can be referred to as an additional criterion to adjudicate between multiple potential matches. Our software uses a probabilistic record linkage algorithm based on the Fellegi-Sunter model to search and rank potential matches in the HDSS data source. Key advantages of this software are its ability to perform multiple searches for the same individual and save patient-specific notes that are retrieved during subsequent clinic visits. A search on the HDSS database (n=110,000) takes less than 15 seconds to complete. Excluding time spent obtaining written consent, the median duration of time we spend with each patient is six minutes. In this setting, a purely automated retrospective approach to record linkage would have only correctly identified about half of the true matches and resulted in high linkage errors; therefore highlighting immediate benefit of conducting interactive record linkage using the PIRL software."

DMPA is the most common contraceptive used in many countries worst affected by the HIV epidemic. To provide robust evidence for contraceptive decision-making among women, clinicians and planners, we are conducting the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) study in four countries with high HIV incidence and DMPA use: Kenya, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia (Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT02550067).   We randomized HIV negative, sexually active women 16-35 years old requesting effective contraception and agreeing to participate to either DMPA, the copper T 380A intrauterine device or levonorgestrel implant. Participants attend a contraception support visit after 1 month and quarterly visits thereafter for up to 18 months. Participants receive a standard HIV prevention package and contraceptive side-effect management at each visit. The primary outcome is HIV seroconversion. Secondary outcomes include pregnancy, serious adverse events and method discontinuation. The sample size of 7800 women provides 80% power to detect a 50% relative increase in HIV risk between any of the three method pairs, assuming 250 incident infections per comparison.   Several WHO consultations have concluded that current evidence on HIV risk associated with DMPA is inconclusive and that a randomized trial is needed to guide policy, counselling and choice. Previous studies suggest that women without a specific contraceptive preference are willing to accept randomization to different contraceptive methods. Stringent performance standards are monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board approximately every 6 months. The study has been conducted with extensive stakeholder engagement.   The ECHO study is designed to provide robust evidence on the relative risks (HIV acquisition) and benefits (pregnancy prevention) between three effective contraceptive methods."

A population-based, retrospective study was conducted between April and July 2014, in 15 high TB burden wards in Mumbai, to capture the patient pathways to TB care. A total of 23 DR-TB patients were identified and their pathways to access DR-TB care were recorded using semi-structured interviews.    The total DR-TB pathway time of new patients (who did not report any past episode of TB) (180 days; IQR 123,346) was found to be more than twice that of retreatment patients (who reported a past episode of TB) (69 days; IQR 42,128).    The unacceptable delay for diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB in Mumbai advocates for consistent implementation of early screening of patients using rapid gene-based technologies."

Wilson,Monica Lamoureux,Matthew Henderson,Beth Potter,Julian Little,Pranesh Chakraborty,Kumanan Wilson",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,70,472,"Secondary use of newborn screening dried blood spot samples include use for biomedical or epidemiological research. However, the effects of storage conditions on archival samples requires further examination. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of residual newborn samples for deriving reliable metabolic gestational age estimates.   Residual newborn dried blood spot samples that had been stored for 2-, 4-, 6-, or 12-months in temperature controlled (21°C) conditions were re-analyzed for the full panel of newborn screening analytes offered by a provincial newborn screening lab in Ottawa, Canada. Data from re-analyzed samples were compared to corresponding baseline newborn screening values for absolute agreement, and Pearson and intraclass correlation. Performance of a gestational age estimation algorithm originally developed from baseline newborn screening values was then validated on data derived from stored samples.   A total of 307 samples were used for this study. 17-hydroxyprogesterone and newborn hemoglobin profiles measured by immunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively, were among the most stable markers across all time points of analysis. Acylcarnitines exhibited the greatest degree of variation in stability upon repeat measurement. The largest shifts in newborn analyte profiles and the poorest performance of metabolic gestational age algorithms were observed when samples were analyzed 12-months after sample collection.   Duration of sample storage, independent of temperature and humidity, affects newborn screening profiles and gestational age estimates derived from metabolic gestational dating algorithms. When considering use of dried blood spot samples either for clinical or research purposes, care should be taken when interpreting data stemming from secondary use."

This is a quasi-experimental study, with a pragmatic trial design, to be conducted over the course of three years. A mixed methods design will be used to evaluate the effects of health systems strengthening and differential pricing on the management of diabetes, hypertension and selected cancers in Ghana. A public private partnership was established between all sites that will receive multi-level interventions, including health systems strengthening  and access to medicines interventions.    Study participants will include individuals with new or previously diagnosed hypertension and diabetes (n=3,300), who present to two major referral hospitals, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and Tamale Teaching Hospital, as well as three district hospitals, namely Kings Medical Centre, Agogo Presbyterian District Hospital, and Atua Government Hospital.    The objective of this study aims to test approaches intended to improve access to drugs for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes, and improve disease control. Patients with these conditions will benefit from health systems strengthening interventions (education, counseling, improved management of disease), and increased access to innovative medicines via differential pricing.  Pilot programs also will facilitate health system strengthening at the participating institutions, which includes training of clinicians and updating of guidelines and production of protocols for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension and cancer."

Rimon",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,162,1246,"The demographic dividend, defined as the economic growth potential resulting from favorable shifts in population age structure following rapid fertility decline, has been widely employed to advocate improving access to family planning. The current framework focuses on the long-term potential, while the short-term benefits may also help persuade policy makers to invest in family planning.    We estimate the short- and medium-term economic benefits from two major family planning goals: the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020)’s goal of adding 120 million modern contraceptive users by 2020; Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3.7 of ensuring universal access to family planning by 2030. We apply the cohort component method to World Population Prospects and National Transfer Accounts data. India and Nigeria, respectively the most populous Asian and African country under the FP2020 initiative, are used as case studies.    Meeting the FP2020 target implies that on average, the number of children that need to be supported by every 100 working-age people would decrease by 8 persons in India and 11 persons in Nigeria in 2020; the associated reduction remains at 8 persons in India, but increases to 14 persons in Nigeria by 2030 under the SDG 3.7. In India meeting the FP2020 target would yield a saving of US$18.2 billion (PPP) in consumption expenditures for children and youth in the year 2020 alone, and that increased to US$89.7 billion by 2030. In Nigeria the consumption saved would be US$2.5 billion in 2020 and $12.9 billion by 2030.    The tremendous economic benefits from meeting the FP2020 and SDG family planning targets demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of investment in promoting access to contraceptive methods. The gap already apparent between the observed and targeted trajectories indicates tremendous missing opportunities. Accelerated progress is needed to achieve the FP2020 and SDG goals and so reap the demographic dividend."

A consortium of partners, including VillageReach, the Ministry of Health in Mozambique and the World Health Organization, will implement a strategy to reduce MOV in Mozambique. The strategy involves demonstrating the magnitude of missed opportunities and their causes, and exploring tailored health system interventions to reduce them, with the aim of increasing vaccination coverage and timeliness of vaccinations.   : A mixed-methods approach will incorporate both quantitative and qualitative tools. The assessment will target caregivers of children between the ages of 0–23 months who attend a health facility in the selected districts on the day of the assessment. Caregivers who are at least 18 years old will be eligible for inclusion. Another component of the assessment will target all health workers in the selected health facilities on the day of the assessment. A sample of 30 health facilities in different regions of the country will be assessed, with a target sample size of 600 caregiver exit interviews, 300 health worker interviews and focus group discussions with both caregivers and health workers. Data collection will commence late 2017, and the data will be electronically captured, managed and analyzed. Thematic analysis of data from the qualitative aspects of the assessment will be conducted, presenting the scope of interviews, representative verbatim quotes and key conclusions.    : A concerted effort to reduce or eliminate MOV could increase vaccine coverage by up to 30% and may contribute to wider improvements in efficiencies of service delivery beyond the immunization program. In addition, the findings could contribute to a better understanding of MOV in similar settings."

Low rates of syphilis screening during pregnancy and treatment of those found seropositive have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia. We report the rates on antenatal syphilis screening, the seroprevalence of syphilis infection, and the frequency of antibiotic treatment in pregnant women screened positive for syphilis during their attendance at antenatal care (ANC) clinics in Kinshasa, DRC and Lusaka, Zambia.   Women attending their first ANC were enrolled consecutively during a 9-month period in 16 and 13 ANC clinics in Kinshasa and Lusaka respectively, in the context of the baseline period of a cluster trial. Study personnel collected data on women’s characteristics, the syphilis screening practices, the test results, and the frequency of treatment, that were done under routine ANC conditions and registered in the clinic records.   4,153 women in Kinshasa and 18,097 women in Lusaka were enrolled. The frequency of screening at the first visit was 59.7% (n= 2,479) in Kinshasa, and 27.8% (n=5,025) in Lusaka. Screening test availability varied. In the periods in which tests were available the screening rates were 92.8% in Kinshasa and 52.0% in Lusaka. The frequency of women screened seropositive was 0.4% (n=10) in Kinshasa and 2.2% (n=109) in Lusaka. Respectively, 10% (n=1) and 11.9% (n= 13) among seropositive women received treatment at the first visit.   The results of the study show that screening for syphilis in pregnancy is not universal even when supplies are available. Our ongoing trial will evaluate the impact of a behavioral intervention on changing health providers’ practices to increase screening and treatment rates when supplies are available."

While the annual number of cases of GWD have been consistently reported by WHO since the 1990s, the burden of disability due to GWD has not previously been quantified in GBD.    The incidence of GWD was modeled for each endemic country using annual national case reports. A literature search was conducted to characterize the presentation of GWD, translate the clinical symptoms into health sequelae, and then assign an average duration to the infection. Prevalence measures by sequelae were multiplied by disability weights to estimate DALYs.    The total DALYs attributed to GWD across all endemic countries (n=21) in 1990 was 50,725 (95% UI: 35,265–69,197) and decreased to 0.9 (95% UI: 0.5–1.4) in 2016. A cumulative total of 12,900 DALYs were attributable to GWD from 1990 to 2016.    Using 1990 estimates of burden propagated forward, this analysis suggests that between 990,000 to 1.9 million DALYs have been averted as a result of the eradication program over the past 27 years."

We aimed to describe issues surrounding acceptance and demand creation for maternal vaccines in Kenya from a provider perspective.    Nurses and clinical officers were recruited for semi-structured interviews covering resources for vaccine delivery, patient education, knowledge and attitudes surrounding maternal vaccines, and opportunities for demand creation for new vaccines. Interviews were conducted in English and Swahili, transcribed verbatim from audio recordings, and analyzed using codes developed from interview guide questions and emergent themes.    Providers expressed favorable attitudes about currently available maternal immunizations and introduction of additional vaccines, viewing themselves as primarily responsible for vaccine promotion and patient education.  The importance of educational resources for both patients and providers to maintain high levels of maternal immunization coverage was a common theme. Most identified barriers to vaccine acceptance and delivery were cultural and systematic in nature. Suggestions for improvement included improved patient and provider education, including material resources, and community engagement through religious and cultural leaders.    The distribution of standardized, evidence-based print materials for patient education may reduce provider overwork and facilitate in-clinic efforts to inform women about maternal vaccines. Continuing education for providers should address communication surrounding current vaccines and those under consideration for introduction into routine schedules. Engagement of religious and community leaders, as well as male decision-makers in the household, will enhance future acceptance of maternal vaccines."

Lavery",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,251,1228,"The US National Academies’ (NAS) recent report ‘Gene Drives on the Horizon: Advancing Science, Navigating Uncertainty, and Aligning Research with Public Values’ examines the requirements of responsible conduct in research involving gene drives in non-human organisms. Many of the complex ethical issues raised by the introduction of gene drive technologies for mosquito population control have been anticipated during the development and field-testing of earlier-generation genetic engineering approaches with mosquitoes. One issue—the requirement for informed consent in field trials—is not addressed explicitly in the NAS’ report. Some commentators have presumed that informed consent should play a role as a protection for research participants in studies of genetically modified mosquitoes. Others have argued that there are no human subjects of field trials, so the informed consent requirement does not apply. It is both ethically and practically important that these presumptions are adequately scrutinized to ensure that any applications of informed consent in these trials are properly justified. We argue that informed consent from individual research participants in gene drive trials may be required: (1) when blood and other forms of clinical data are collected from them, as will likely be the case in some studies involving epidemiological endpoints, such as the incidence of new infections with dengue and malaria; (2) when they participate in social science and/or behavioral research involving the completion of surveys and questionnaires; or (3) when their home or property is accessed and the location recorded as a spatial variable for the release or collection of mosquitoes because the precise location of the household is important for entomological reasons and these data constitute identifiable private information at the household level. Importantly, most regulations and guidelines allow these requirements to be waived or modified, to various degrees, according to the judgment of Institutional Review Boards."

Burnout, defined as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal achievement, negatively impacts motivation and may further decrease productivity of already limited workforces. The objective of this review was to analyze the prevalence of and factors associated with provider burnout in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).   We performed a systematic review of articles on outpatient provider burnout in LMICs published up to 2016 in three electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CAB). Articles were reviewed to identify prevalence of factors associated with provider burnout.   A total of 6,182 articles were identified, with 20 meeting eligibility criteria. We found heterogeneity in definition and prevalence of burnout. Most studies assessed burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. All three dimensions of burnout were seen across multiple cadres (physicians, nurses, community health workers, midwives, and pharmacists). Frontline nurses in South Africa had the highest prevalence of high emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while PHC providers in Lebanon had the highest reported prevalence of low personal achievement. Higher provider burnout (for example, among nurses, pharmacists, and rural health workers) was associated with high job stress, high time pressure and workload, and lack of organizational support.   Our comprehensive review of published literature showed that provider burnout is prevalent across various health care providers in LMICs. Further studies are required to better measure the causes and consequences of burnout and guide the development of effective interventions to reduce or prevent burnout."

To date, PCV13 paediatric coverage in Malawi has not been rigorously assessed.  We used household surveys to longitudinally track paediatric PCV13 coverage in rural Malawi.   Samples of 60 randomly selected children (30 infants aged 6 weeks to 4 months and 30 aged 4-16 months) were sought in each of 20 village clinic catchment ‘basins’ of Kabudula health area, Lilongwe, Malawi between March 2012 and June 2014. Child health information was reviewed and mothers interviewed to determine each child’s PCV13 dose status and vaccine timing. The survey was completed six times in 4-8 month intervals. Survey inference was used to assess PCV13 dose coverage in each basin for each age group. All 20 basins were pooled to assess area-wide vaccination coverage over time, by age in months, and adherence to the vaccination schedule.   We surveyed a total of 8,562 children in six surveys; 82% were in the older age group. Overall, in age-eligible children, two-dose and three-dose coverage increased from 30% to 85% and 10% to 86%, respectively, between March 2012 and June 2014.  PCV13 coverage was higher in the older age group in all surveys. Although it varied by basin, PCV13 coverage was consistently delayed: median ages at first, second and third doses were 9, 15 and 21 weeks, respectively.   In our rural study area, PCV13 introduction did not meet the Malawi Ministry of Health one-year three-dose 90% coverage target, but after 2 years reached levels likely to reduce the prevalence of both invasive and non-invasive paediatric pneumococcal diseases. Better adherence to the PCV13 schedule may reduce pneumococcal disease in younger Malawian children."

Willis,Nick Hamon",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,53,513,The Sustainable Development Goals include goals to reduce malaria and stunting. Stunting is a result of childhood undernutrition. Our previous studies found that suppressing malaria could reduce poverty rates among agricultural households in Africa. The objective of this paper is to highlight how suppressing malaria could have the further effect of reducing stunting rates among children in agricultural households.    We estimated the burden of stunting among children in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa on the basis of our previous research and data from UNICEF. We also used an evaluation of the impact of a nutrition program in Peru to assess the potential for poverty reduction to reduce stunting.    We estimated that there are approximately 21.5 million children suffering from stunting in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty reduction was found to be a necessary condition to reduce stunting via a multisectoral nutrition program in Peru. The potential impact of suppressing malaria on the poverty rate of agricultural households could therefore play an important role in nutrition programs aiming to reduce stunting in Africa. Reducing the number of children with stunting in these households would improve their health and productivity as adults.   We have developed the first estimates of the burden of stunting in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding how suppressing malaria affects stunting in these households could affect funding for anti-malaria programs. Future research should use longitudinal data to examine this impact at a finer spatial scale.

Data regarding the use of NTP GeneXpert machines for other diseases and GeneXpert procurement by other disease control programs were collected. Market penetration was estimated by the ratio of total sputum smear volume for initial diagnosis divided by the number of Xpert MTB/RIF tests procured in the public sector.   The survey response rate was 21/22 (95%). Smear/Xpert ratios decreased in 17/21 countries and increased in four countries, since 2014. The median ratio decreased from 32.6 (IQR: 44.6) in 2014 to 6.0 (IQR: 15.4) in 2016. In 2016, the median GeneXpert utilization was 20%, however seven countries (7/19; 37%) were running tests for other diseases on their NTP-procured GeneXpert systems in 2017, such as HIV, hepatitis-C virus (HCV),  , and  . Five (5/15; 33%) countries reported GeneXpert procurement by HIV or HCV programs in 2016 and/or 2017.   Our results show a positive trend for Xpert MTB/RIF market penetration in 21 HBC public sectors. However, GeneXpert machines were under-utilized for TB, and inadequately exploited as a multi disease technology."

Automated algorithms for VA COD assignment have been developed and their performance has been assessed against physician and clinical diagnoses. Since the performance of automated classification methods remains low, we aimed to enhance the Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) algorithm to produce better ranked COD classifications on 26,766 deaths from four globally diverse VA datasets compared to some of the leading VA classification methods, namely Tariff, InterVA-4, InSilicoVA and NBC. We used a different strategy, by training multiple NBC algorithms using the one-against-all approach (OAA-NBC). To compare performance, we computed the cumulative cause-specific mortality fraction (CSMF) accuracies for population-level agreement from rank one to five COD classifications. To assess individual-level COD assignments, cumulative partially-chance corrected concordance (PCCC) and sensitivity was measured for up to five ranked classifications. Overall results show that OAA-NBC consistently assigns CODs that are the most alike physician and clinical COD assignments compared to some of the leading algorithms based on the cumulative CSMF accuracy, PCCC and sensitivity scores. The results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of classification (sensitivity) by between 6% and 8% compared with other VA algorithms. Population-level agreements for OAA-NBC and NBC were found to be similar or higher than the other algorithms used in the experiments. Although OAA-NBC still requires improvement for individual-level COD assignment, the one-against-all approach improved its ability to assign CODs that more closely resemble physician or clinical COD classifications compared to some of the other leading VA classifiers."

Wright,Abi Gleek,Nora Bergin,R. Algy Williams,Sohail Agha",,65,1014,"In a paper titled “Responsive feedback: Towards a new paradigm to enhance intervention effectiveness”, Viswanath  . argue that dominant models of intervention design do not account for the complexity and unpredictability of implementation challenges.  Particularly in the behavioural sciences, intervention designs need to consider many factors that will be uncertain, or unknown, at the beginning of a new project.    This letter describes how we were able to respond to feedback during the design phase of a proof-of-concept project to create a digital service business for Nigerian patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs).  Our approach was to create an initial ‘Theory of Change’ (ToC) based on a similar project with Kenyan shopkeepers.  This ToC was revised following user feedback and a landscape analysis with key stakeholders.  The new ToC required us to access additional funding to create a ‘digital ordering’ facility for the PPMVs.  Digital ordering provides a mechanism whereby we can reduce the prevalence of counterfeit medicines, offer the PPMVs credit and group-buying facilities, and reduce supply chain costs through co-distribution with fast-moving consumer goods.   An important learning point was that while our focus was on designing a platform to meet users’ needs, changes in regulation meant that we spent considerably more time than anticipated meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, the importance of ensuring stakeholders’ continued buy-in cannot be underestimated and has likely increased the sustainability of the project in the longer term.   As Viswanath  . suggest, for responsive approaches to be widely adopted needs more flexibility than exists in current funding models and project plans.  Both funding bodies and grantees will need to be more responsive to feedback coming from the field."

Our study explores how the change in fertility desires influence the change in use of modern contraception over time in six cities of Uttar Pradesh, India.    Data for this study comes from the Measurement, Learning and Evaluation (MLE) Project for Urban Health Initiative in six cities of Uttar Pradesh. Our study sample consists of 8735 women (weighted n=8655) who were fertile, non-sterilized and non-pregnant at the time of baseline survey. Potential bias due to lost to follow up was addressed using inverse probability weighing and then generalized estimating equations were applied to get odds for change in use of modern contraceptives.     Contraceptive use increased by different magnitudes from baseline to endline across all six cities. At baseline and endline, women who desired no more children reported a higher use of modern contraception than those who desired more children over time. Women from all cities who desired no more children at baseline had higher odds of modern contraceptive use than that of women who desired more children. The tempo of change in use of modern contraception over time among women with different fertility desires differed across the considered cities.    Although there were city-wise differences observed, women’s fertility intentions have an impact on their use of modern contraceptives over the time period between baseline to endline. To obtain greater insight into city-level differences, mixed method studies will be more effective."

Walther,Monik Gupta,Michael M. Lipp,Holly Chan,John Krzewick,Larry M. Gordon,Alan J. Waring",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,178,1585,": The development of synthetic lung surfactant for preterm infants has focused on peptide analogues of native surfactant proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C). Non-invasive respiratory support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) may benefit from synthetic surfactant for aerosol delivery.   : A total of three dry powder (DP) surfactants, consisting of phospholipids and the SP-B analogue Super Mini-B (SMB), and one negative control DP surfactant without SMB, were produced with the Acorda Therapeutics ARCUS® Pulmonary Dry Powder Technology. Structure of the DP surfactants was compared with FTIR spectroscopy,   surface activity with captive bubble surfactometry, and   activity in surfactant-deficient adult rabbits and preterm lambs. In the animal experiments, intratracheal (IT) aerosol delivery was compared with surfactant aerosolization during nCPAP support. Surfactant dosage was 100 mg/kg of lipids and aerosolization was performed using a low flow inhaler.   FTIR spectra of the three DP surfactants each showed secondary structures compatible with peptide folding as an α-helix hairpin, similar to that previously noted for surface-active SMB in other lipids. The DP surfactants with SMB demonstrated   surface activity <1 mN/m. Oxygenation and lung function increased quickly after IT aerosolization of DP surfactant in both surfactant-deficient rabbits and preterm lambs, similar to improvements seen with clinical surfactant. The response to nCPAP aerosol delivery of DP surfactant was about 50% of IT aerosol delivery, but could be boosted with a second dose in the preterm lambs.    Aerosol delivery of DP synthetic surfactant during non-invasive respiratory support with nCPAP significantly improved oxygenation and lung function in surfactant-deficient animals and this response could be enhanced by giving a second dose. Aerosol delivery of DP synthetic lung surfactant has potential for clinical applications."

Building upon the advances of global policymaking for HIV/AIDS and creating a framework for countries and organizations to monitor progress in epilepsy care will help direct and justify much-needed novel programming. Given the clarity of the HIV/AIDS care continuum model and the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, I propose this same approach to the cascade of care could be used as a viable framework for people with epilepsy. In this model, the targets of success include (1) ensuring 90% of all people with epilepsy are aware of their diagnosis as a brain disorder, (2) starting 90% of people with epilepsy on quality controlled, appropriately chosen and well stocked antiepileptic drugs, and (3) achieving seizure freedom in 70% of those treated. At least 90% of all people with epilepsy must also be linked to and retained in appropriate care. Although the precise numbers may be debated, this cascade of care approach will assist in deconstructing the barriers to epilepsy care in populations better than the more familiar concept of the epilepsy treatment gap. These reflect concrete goals for health systems for epilepsy care that, if achieved, could lead to seizure freedom for the many people in lower income countries living with poorly controlled epilepsy."

We developed a multi-level intervention to increase uptake of the postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD, defined as insertion up to six weeks post-delivery) in Kigali, Rwanda. High-volume hospitals and health centers were selected for implementation of PPIUD counseling and service delivery. Formative work informed development of a PPIUD counseling flipchart to be delivered during antenatal care, labor and delivery, infant vaccination visits, or in the community. Two-day didactic counseling, insertion/removal, and follow-up trainings were provided to labor and delivery and family planning nurses followed by a mentored practicum certification process. Counseling data were collected in government clinic logbooks. Insertions and follow-up data were collected in logbooks created for the implementation. Data were collected by trained government clinic staff and abstracted/managed by study staff. Stakeholders were involved from intervention development through dissemination of results.   Two hospitals (and their two associated health centers) and two additional health centers were selected. In 6-months prior to our intervention, 7.7 PPIUDs/month were inserted on average at the selected facilities. From August 2017-July 2018, we trained 83 counselors and 39 providers to provide PPIUD services. N=9,020 women received one-on-one PPIUD counseling after expressing interest in family planning who later delivered at a selected health facility. Of those, n=2,575 had PPIUDs inserted (average of 214.6 insertions/month), a 29% uptake. Most PPIUDs (62%) were inserted within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta.    This successful, comprehensive intervention has the potential to make a significant impact on PPIUD uptake in Rwanda. The intervention is scalable and adaptable to other sub-Saharan African countries."

Current goals include elimination of transmission (EOT) by 2020 in Latin America, Yemen and selected African countries. The new goals propose that, by 2030, EOT be verified in 10 countries; mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin be stopped in at least one focus in 34 countries; and that the proportion of the population no longer in need of MDA be equal or greater than 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% in at least 16, 14, 12, and 10 countries, respectively. The NTD Modelling Consortium onchocerciasis teams have used EPIONCHO and ONCHOSIM to provide modelling insights into these goals. EOT appears feasible in low-moderate endemic areas with long-term MDA at high coverage (≥75%), but uncertain in areas of higher endemicity, poor coverage and adherence, and where MDA has not yet, or only recently, started. Countries will have different proportions of their endemic areas classified according to these categories, and this distribution of pre-intervention prevalence and MDA duration and programmatic success will determine the feasibility of achieving the proposed MDA cessation goals. Highly endemic areas would benefit from switching to biannual or quarterly MDA and implementing vector control where possible (determining optimal frequency and duration of anti-vectorial interventions requires more research). Areas without loiasis that have not yet initiated MDA should implement biannual (preferably with moxidectin) or quarterly MDA from the start. Areas with loiasis not previously treated would benefit from implementing test-and(not)-treat-based interventions, vector control, and anti-  therapies, but their success will depend on the levels of screening and coverage achieved and sustained. The diagnostic performance of IgG4 Ov16 serology for assessing EOT is currently uncertain. Verification of EOT requires novel diagnostics at the individual- and population-levels."

We sought to assess whether differential pricing of medicines based on socio-economic status would improve affordability of antihypertensive and anti-diabetic medications. A quasi-experimental, prospective cohort study was implemented at five Ghanaian health facilities, using medicines differentially priced by three pharmaceutical companies.    Adult patients ≥18 years with hypertension or DM were enrolled and assigned to a lower tiered differential price (DP arm) or market price (MP arm) based on minimum wage earning or a score >6/18 on a multi-dimensional poverty index scale. Study medicines were purchased at either the DP or MP when prescribed. Participants were followed for 18 months to assess blood pressure (BP) and glycemic control. Predictors of ability to purchase study medicines were assessed using parsimonious logistic regression models.    3,296 participants were enrolled with mean age of 57±12.7 years, 76.6% females. 1,869 (56.7%) had hypertension, 422 (12.8%) had DM, and 1,005 (30.5%) with both hypertension and DM. Average follow-up was 14 months. There were prescriptions of study medications for 526 participants of which 238 (45.2%) were able to make purchases at DP 60.9% versus MP 39.1%. Independent predictors of purchasing ability were higher income, MP arm, willingness to purchase additional medicines, and being at tertiary level institution.    Approximately 45% of Ghanaians could afford prescribed study medicines provided at a differential pricing mechanism albeit at an unsustainable basis. Further price reductions are expected to enhance access to medicines for hypertension and DM control."

The three main STHs are  ,   and hookworm (  and  ). Approximately 1.5 billion people are infected with STHs worldwide. The World Health Organization goal for 2030 is morbidity control, defined as reaching <2% prevalence of medium-to-high intensity infections in preschool-age children and school-age children (SAC). Treatment guidelines for achieving this goal have been recommended. The Neglected Tropical Diseases Modelling Consortium has developed mathematical and statistical models to quantify, predict, and evaluate the impact of control measures on STHs. These models show that the morbidity target can be achieved following current guidelines in moderate prevalence settings (20-50% in SAC). In high prevalence settings, semi-annual preventive chemotherapy (PC) ideally including adults, or at least women of reproductive age, is required. For  , dual therapy with albendazole and ivermectin is required. In general, stopping PC is not possible without infection resurgence, unless effective measures for improved access to water, hygiene, and sanitation have been implemented, or elimination of transmission has been achieved. Current diagnostic methods are based on egg counts in stool samples, but these are known to have poor sensitivity at low prevalence levels. A target threshold for novel, more sensitive diagnostics should be defined relative to currently preferred diagnostics (Kato-Katz). Our analyses identify the extent of systematic non-access to treatment and the individual patterns of compliance over multiple rounds of treatment as the biggest unknowns and the main impediment to reaching the target. Moreover, the link between morbidity and infection intensity has not been fully elucidated. By providing more insights on all the above, we aim to inform discussions on the goals and treatment guidelines for STHs."

The innovative A360 approach is led by human-centred design (HCD), combined with social marketing, developmental neuroscience, public health, sociocultural anthropology and youth engagement ‘lenses’, and aims to create context-specific, youth-driven solutions that respond to the needs of adolescent girls. The A360 external evaluation includes a process evaluation, quasi-experimental outcome evaluation, and a cost-effectiveness study. We reflect on evaluation opportunities and challenges associated with measuring the application and impact of this novel HCD-led design approach.  For the process evaluation, participant observations were key to capturing the depth of the fast-paced, highly-iterative HCD process, and to understand decision-making within the design process. The evaluation team had to be flexible and align closely with the work plan of the implementers. The HCD process meant that key information such as intervention components, settings, and eligible populations were unclear and changed over outcome evaluation and cost-effectiveness protocol development. This resulted in a more time-consuming and resource-intensive study design process. As much time and resources went into the creation of a new design approach, separating one-off “creation” costs versus those costs associated with actually implementing the programme was challenging. Opportunities included the potential to inform programmatic decision-making in real-time to ensure that interventions adequately met the contextualized needs in targeted areas.  Robust evaluation of interventions designed using HCD, a promising and increasingly popular approach, is warranted yet challenging. Future HCD-based initiatives should consider a phased evaluation, focusing initially on programme theory refinement and process evaluation, and then, when the intervention program details are clearer, following with outcome evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. A phased approach would delay the availability of evaluation findings but would allow for a more appropriate and tailored evaluation design."

Prentice,Carla Cerami",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,61,468,"Neonatal infection is the third largest cause of death in children under five worldwide.  Nutritional immunity is the process by which the host innate immune system limits nutrient availability to invading organisms. Iron is an essential micronutrient for both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts. Changes in iron availability and distribution have significant effects on pathogen virulence and on the immune response to infection. Our previously published data shows that, during the first 24 hours of life, full-term neonates have reduced overall serum iron. Transferrin saturation decreases rapidly from 45% in cord blood to ~20% by six hours post-delivery.   To study neonatal nutritional immunity and its role in neonatal susceptibility to infection, we will conduct an observational study on 300 full-term normal birth weight (FTB+NBW), 50 preterm normal birth weight (PTB+NBW), 50 preterm low birth weight (PTB+LBW) and 50 full-term low birth weight (FTB+LBW), vaginally-delivered neonates born at Kanifing General Hospital, The Gambia. We will characterize and quantify iron-related nutritional immunity during the early neonatal period and use   sentinel bacterial growth assays to assess how differences in serum iron affect bacterial growth. Blood samples will be collected from the umbilical cord (arterial and venous) and at serial time points from the neonates over the first week of life.   Currently, little is known about nutritional immunity in neonates. In this study, we will increase understanding of how nutritional immunity may protect neonates from infection during the first critical days of life by limiting the pathogenicity and virulence of neonatal sepsis causing organisms by reducing the availability of iron. Additionally, we will investigate the hypothesis that this protective mechanism may not be activated in preterm and low birth weight neonates, potentially putting these babies at an enhanced risk of neonatal infection.      clinicaltrials.gov ( ) 27/11/2017"

Consequently, Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung (DSW) has been undertaking annual budget studies in Kenya and Uganda to track financial allocation for health and family planning (FP).   This study, carried out between the months of May and October 2017, involved budget analysis of general health and FP funding at national and sub-national level. The study covered the fiscal year 2017/18. However, for comparison purposes, fiscal years 2015/16 and 2016/17 were included in the analysis.   In Uganda, during the 2017/18 fiscal year, the government allocated 0.73% ($3.7 million) of its health sector budget ($506.7 million) to FP; of which 98.8% ($3.6 million) was allocated to National Medical Stores (NMS), mainly for the supply of reproductive health commodities. Analysis of four districts shows that only 0.5% ($7,966), 0.8% ($10,046), 0.9% ($9,663) and 1.9% ($35,395) of the health sector budget was allocated to FP in Kamuli, Mityana, Mukono and Tororo, respectively, during the 2017/18 fiscal year. In Kenya, the FP budget allocation at the national level reduced from $6.05 million in 2015/16 to $2.93 million in 2017/18.

A recent review has compared existing   transmission models, identifying their similarities and differences in structure, parameterization and modelled intervention approaches. While a formal model comparison to investigate the impact of interventions is yet to be conducted, the models agree on the importance of coverage for intervention effectiveness and on the fact that human- and pig-focused interventions can be optimally combined. One of these models, cystiSim, an individual-based, stochastic model has been used to assess field-applicable interventions, some currently under evaluation in on-going trials in Zambia. The EPICYST, population-based, deterministic model has highlighted, based on simulating a generic sub-Saharan Africa setting, the higher efficacy (measured as the percentage of human cysticercosis cases prevented) of biomedical interventions (human and pig treatment and pig vaccination) compared to improved husbandry, sanitation, and meat inspection. Important questions remain regarding which strategies and combinations thereof provide sustainable solutions for severely resource-constrained endemic settings. Defining realistic timeframes to achieve feasible targets, and establishing suitable measures of effectiveness for these targets that can be quantified with current monitoring and evaluation tools, are current major barriers to identifying validated strategies.   transmission models can support setting achievable 2030 goals; however, the refinement of these models is first required. Incorporating socio-economic elements, improved understanding of underlying biological processes, and consideration of spatial dynamics are key knowledge gaps that need addressing to support model development."

Through this novel initiative a prospective cohort of patients with hypertension and diabetes were followed in Ghana and the Philippines to examine the effect of differential pricing on access to treatment of hypertension and diabetes. An integrated approach including differential pricing, health systems strengthening, improved supply chain management and greater affordability can improve access to medicines for NCDs.      While differential pricing has several advantages for improving the affordability of NCD medicines in LMICs, it can’t overcome all barriers as a standalone approach.  An integrated approach to health systems strengthening, supply chain management and affordability are needed to overcome key challenges in getting medicines for NCD to patients in LMICs. Availability and affordability of medicines to treat NCDs among vulnerable patients will help achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC)."

There are also huge disparities sub-nationally, ranging from 25% to 60%. While there is a strong need to monitor the progress of family planning program regularly at the national and sub-national level, Myanmar has limited surveys, data quality and methodological issues in its Health Management Information System (HMIS), and a scattered rollout of the Logistic Management Information System (LMIS).    To identify viable options for annual monitoring, four data sources: modelled contraceptive prevalence rate for modern methods (mCPR) estimates from Track20’s  Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET); method-specific prevalence from the  2015-16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); mCPR estimates and method prevalence from  HMIS and estimates of modern method use (EMU) based on commodity consumption data from LMIS, were used to compare for the years 2015-2017. Estimates of mCPR from HMIS were tested for accuracy based on whether they fell within the 95% confidence interval of mCPR estimates from the FPET for the corresponding years. EMU from LMIS was also tested for those years and States/Regions where available.    For annual tracking of mCPR, direct estimates of HMIS were considered; they were much higher than those of the DHS survey and were not matched by FPET results, except in Chin and Kayin. To monitor the method mix, HMIS data can be used as these are similar pattern with DHS in both national and State/Regional level except Chin and Kayin. LMIS could be used in annual tracking when there are high reporting rates and valid information of consumption.    Track20’s FPET is the method of choice to get valid information for annual monitoring of family planning program."

Most supply side investments are focused on replacing or establishing new health facilities to improve access to immunization. However, supply chain design must be improved to ensure that potent vaccines are available at all facilities to promote immunization equity. We used the supply chain design process in Pakistan as an opportunity to conceptualize how supply chains could impact equity outcomes. This paper outlines our approach and key considerations for assessing supply chain design as a contributing factor in achieving equitable delivery of immunization services.    We conducted a supply chain analysis based on sub-national supply chain and immunization coverage at district level. Supply chain metrics included cold chain coverage and distances between vaccination sites and storage locations. Immunization coverage metrics included the third-dose diphtheria- tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccination rate and the disparity in DTP3 coverage between urban and rural areas. All metrics were analyzed at the district level. Despite data limitations, triangulation across these metrics provided useful insights into the potential contributions of supply chain to equitable program performance at the district level within each province. Overall, our analysis identified supply chain gaps, highlighted supply chain contributions to program performance and informed future health system investments to prioritize children unreached by immunization services."

Maximizing the proportion of people with successful outcomes within a budget-constrained context requires identifying and implementing interventions that are not only effective, but also cost-effective.    We developed a software application called the Cascade Analysis Tool that implements advanced analysis and optimization methods for understanding cascades, combined with the flexibility to enable application across a wide range of areas in health and development. The tool allows users to design the cascade, collate and enter data, and then use the built-in analysis methods in order to answer key policy questions, such as: understanding where the biggest drop-offs along the cascade are; visualizing how the cascade varies by population; investigating the impact of introducing a new intervention or scaling up/down existing interventions; and estimating how available funding should be optimally allocated among available interventions in order to achieve a variety of different objectives selectable by the user (such as optimizing cascade outcomes in target years). The Cascade Analysis Tool is available via a user-friendly web-based application, and comes with a user guide, a library of pre-made examples, and training materials.

By meeting contraceptive needs of all women, significant public health impact and development gains accrue. At the same time, governments face the complex challenge of allocating finite resources to competing priorities, each of which presents known and unknown challenges and opportunities. Zambia has experienced a slow but steady increase in contraceptive prevalence, with slight decline in total fertility rate (TFR), over the past 20 years. Drawing from the Zambian context, including a review of current policy solutions, we present a case for making investments in voluntary family planning (FP), underpinned by a human rights framework, as a pillar for accelerating development and socio-economic advancement. Through multilevel interventions aimed at averting unintended pregnancies, Zambia – and other low- and middle-income countries – can reduce their age dependency ratios and harness economic growth opportunities awarded by the demographic dividend while improving the health and quality of life of the population."

The test can rapidly detect TB in severely ill PLHIV and can identify PLHIV most at-risk of death, leading to mortality reductions. However, its uptake in countries with high burdens of TB and HIV has been slow. To assess the current use landscape and identify barriers to the adoption of Alere-LAM, we conducted a questionnaire-based study in 31 high TB and HIV/AIDS burden countries.   : Between November 2018 and December 2019, we collected responses to a semi-structured questionnaire that had been emailed to staff and affiliates of National TB Programs or HIV/AIDS Programs, Ministries of Health, and TB or HIV institutes of 31 high TB/HIV burden countries. Questions concerned country policies, adoption, and current use of Alere-LAM testing, as well as testing algorithms and barriers preventing Alere-LAM uptake.    We received questionnaire responses from 24 out of 31 (77%) high TB/HIV burden countries. Of these 24 countries, 11 (46%) had adopted Alere-LAM policies, with only five (21%) countries currently using Alere-LAM testing. Testing algorithms were generally aligned with WHO recommendations. Fifteen countries (63%) said they were planning to implement Alere-LAM testing in the near future. The most commonly cited constraint to adoption and implementation was budget limitations. Additional barriers to Alere-LAM implementation included lack of country-specific data and piloting, administrative hurdles such as regulatory agency approval, lack of coordination between National TB and HIV programs, and small perceived patient population.    Responses to our questionnaire demonstrate the persistent gap between country-level policy and real-world use of Alere-LAM, as well as specific barriers that must be addressed to scale-up testing in PLHIV."

We conducted a qualitative assessment of providers’ experiences across the five programs and an analysis of service delivery costs in one program.   : We conducted 20 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with providers. We used project expenditure records to estimate incremental direct service delivery costs of introducing the LNG-IUS in 40 social franchise clinics supported by the Society for Family Health (SFH). We then compared the direct service delivery costs per couple years of protection (CYP) for the LNG-IUS to other family planning methods.   : Providers appreciated the therapeutic benefits of the LNG-IUS, especially reduction of heavy bleeding. They said that women generally accepted bleeding changes with counseling but noted complaints about spotting and mixed acceptability of amenorrhea. Providers indicated being comfortable with both the insertion and removal process and believed their equipment and infection prevention protocols were adequate. Lack of awareness among women, limited availability, current pricing, and resistance to uterine placement among some women were perceived as barriers. The estimated direct service delivery cost of introducing the LNG-IUS in pilot settings, inclusive of up-front provider training costs, was USD 34 per insertion. Direct service delivery costs at a ‘steady state’ (i.e., without training costs included for any method) of the LNG-IUS per CYP was similar to that of other contraceptive methods distributed in Nigeria.   : Providers’ positive experiences with the LNG-IUS and direct service delivery costs per CYP that align with those for other methods suggest that the LNG-IUS could be an important addition to the method mix in Nigeria. Product introduction strategies will need to address both the supply and the demand sides, as well as consider appropriate pricing of the LNG-IUS relative to other methods and particularly the copper IUD."

Warren",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,60,518,"When evaluating the effects of vaccination programs, it is common to estimate changes in rates of disease before and after vaccine introduction. There are a number of related approaches that attempt to adjust for trends unrelated to the vaccine and to detect changes that coincide with introduction. However, characteristics of the data can influence the ability to estimate such a change. These include, but are not limited to, the number of years of available data prior to vaccine introduction, the expected strength of the effect of the intervention, the strength of underlying secular trends, and the amount of unexplained variability in the data. Sources of unexplained variability include model misspecification, epidemics due to unidentified pathogens, and changes in ascertainment or coding practice among others. In this study, we present a simple simulation framework for estimating the power to detect a decline and the precision of these estimates. We use real-world data from a pre-vaccine period to generate simulated time series where the vaccine effect is specified . We present an interactive web-based tool to implement this approach. We also demonstrate the use of this approach using observed data on pneumonia hospitalization from the states in Brazil from a period prior to introduction of pneumococcal vaccines to generate the simulated time series.

Entry requirements for most models include at least six months on treatment and a suppressed viral load. These models thus systematically exclude newly-initiated patients, who instead experience the conventional model of care, which requires frequent, multiple clinic visits that impose costs on both providers and patients. In this open letter, we argue that the conventional model of care for the first six months on ART is no longer adequate. The highest rates of treatment discontinuation are in the first six-month period after treatment initiation. Newly initiating patients are generally healthier than in the past, with higher CD4 counts, and antiretroviral medications are better tolerated, with fewer side effects and substitutions, making extra clinic visits unnecessary. Improvements in the treatment initiation process, such as same-day initiation, have not been followed by innovations in the early treatment period. Finally, the advent of COVID-19 has made it riskier to require multiple clinic visits. Research to develop differentiated models of care for the first six-month period is needed. Priorities include estimating the minimum number and type of provider interactions and ART education needed, optimizing the timing of a patient’s first viral load test, determining when lay providers can replace clinicians, ensuring that patients have sufficient but not burdensome access to support, and identifying ways to establish a habit of lifelong adherence."

In order to design and implement impactful interventions, baseline data on the causes of such losses are needed. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out targeted field surveys, including interviews with ruminant farmers, veterinary professionals and other stakeholders in livestock farming to establish the main causes of disease and mortality including abortions in cattle and small ruminants (SR).    Northern Nigeria was selected because the majority of the nation’s ruminants belong to pastoralists who are primarily resident in this region. Seven states; Bauchi, Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Niger, Sokoto and Zamfara states were surveyed. The responses were collated and a comprehensive descriptive analysis was carried out.    Average cattle herd sizes ranged from 28 in Zamfara to 103 in Nasarawa; and from 27 in Kano to 128 in Sokoto for SR. In cattle, Trypanosomosis (with 4.27% mortality rate), foot and mouth disease (3.81%), nutritional insufficiency (1.93%) and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP; 1.44%) were the top four diseases/health problems that resulted in the highest mortality due to diseases within each state surveyed. For SR, trypanosomosis (with 6.85% mortality rate), Peste des Petits Ruminants (4.99%), orf (3.06%), foot rot (2.97%) and foot and mouth disease (2.94%) were the most important diseases responsible for the highest number of mortalities and culling for disease.   The study revealed that there are significant losses via mortalities due to the occurrence of disease amongst the ruminant populations countrywide, as evidenced by the high overall mortality rates of both cattle (15.3%) and small ruminants (30.9%) from various diseases.

The objective of this analysis was to assess whether, and if so how, the women participating in the TRIO Study perceived themselves as co-designers of the three MPT products.    We conducted 55 in-depth interviews, 6 focus group discussions, and 5 dissemination workshops with TRIO Study participants. Woven throughout these activities were questions and opportunities for participants to reflect on their role in the study, and to what extent they identified with their role as a co-designer. Qualitative data from these activities were analyzed thematically.    The analysis revealed four key themes about what resulted in the women’s views as co-designers: altruism, respectful treatment, agency, and reciprocity. The women were aware of their role in determining what end-users would and would not prefer and were motivated by a desire to help themselves and others. They recognized their role as co-designers and cited being treated well by study staff, being given a chance to make choices during the study period, and being recognized as equal partners of the researchers as the main reasons.    If prevention products are going to be successfully developed, end-users and researchers must work hand in hand. Engaging participants meaningfully as co-designers in product development research can be a powerful tool in the effort to ensure new prevention products brought to market are acceptable to the population of interest."

Stock taking is needed to understand, for example, do we expect our current approaches to deliver greater commitment or do we need to change our approach? Is time the limiting factor for FP2020 commitments or are other, contextual, mechanistic and implementation factors more critical?   This paper uses mini-case studies to offer insights in response to these questions. It drew from country status updates of national FP program commitments published on the  . These included country self-assessments, country action for acceleration plans and revitalised commitments using standard templates provided by FP2020.    Critical factors emerging from the case study analysis suggest the following.  : Country programs that adapted best practices through thoughtful selection, regular monitoring, and course correction, were more responsive to context and better able to scale interventions.   : Programs that embedded commitments within national health reforms and transformative agendas were able to sustain commitment and mechanism more effectively over time.  : Programs that were able to balance central coordination with devolved implementation, more effectively translated commitments to action.  : Programs that placed emphasis on monitoring progress and course correct were better able to steward national commitments and partner inputs.   National FP programs included within the country comparative analysis benefitted from their engagement with FP2020. However, not all were able to convert FP2020 commitments into national ownership. In many FP2020 contexts, there is less need for a technical intervention and greater need for engaging politically on sensitive issues that constrain women’s and adolescent empowerment and rights and access to FP."

This study focuses on a research capacity strengthening project supporting seven test facilities in Africa conducting studies on mosquito vector control products towards Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) certification. It captures the primary effects of the project on each facility’s research capacity, the secondary effects at the individual and institutional level, and the ripple effects that extend beyond the research system. The relationships between effects at different levels are identified and compared to an existing framework for the evaluation of research capacity strengthening initiatives.    To capture the views of individuals engaged in the project at all levels within each facility, a maximum-variation purposive sampling strategy was used. This allowed triangulation between different data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals in three facilities and a combination of email and remote video-call interviews were conducted with individuals at two further facilities.    We found that, despite a focus of the GLP certification project at the institutional level, the project had effects also at individual (including enhanced motivation, furtherment of careers) and national/international levels (including development of regional expertise). In addition, we detected ripple effects of the project which extended beyond the research system.    This study shows that research capacity strengthening interventions that are focussed on institutional level goals require actions also at individual and national/international levels. The effects of engagement at all three levels can be amplified by collaborative actions at the national/international level. These findings show that research capacity strengthening projects must develop plans that address and evaluate impact at all three levels. Capturing the ripple effects of investment in research capacity strengthening should also be planned for from the beginning of projects to support further engagement of all stakeholders."

Witbooi,Ben Page,Richard D. Pitcher,Steve Innes",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,36,398,": Most adult cardiovascular disease begins in childhood. Given the burgeoning obesity pandemic in children worldwide, there is a need for precise and scalable surveillance methods to detect subclinical cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents. Early detection allows early intervention and intensified primary prevention strategies in affected individuals. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) directly measures arterial wall stiffness, an early feature of atherosclerosis. Calculation of PWV in growing children requires an accurate estimation of the true distance travelled by the aorto-femoral pressure wave, using surface anatomy landmarks. However, a variety of methods are used to estimate this distance, and these have not previously been investigated in growing children and adolescents. We sought to investigate this by comparing true arterial path length measured on computerized tomography (CT) scans, with a variety of estimations based on surface anatomy landmarks.   : Arterial path lengths were measured using multi-planar reformation (MPR) imaging software. These measurements were then compared with the surface anatomy measurements obtained using the same MPR imaging software. The fidelity of a variety of arterial path length estimation methods was tested.   : The surface anatomy distance between the suprasternal notch and the angle of the mandible (PWV recording site in the neck), should be adjusted using the formula y=4.791+(1.0534*x). This value subtracted from the unadjusted distance from the suprasternal notch to the umbilicus, through the mid-inguinal crease to the femoral PWV recording site, provides the simplest reliable approximation of true intraluminal distance travelled.   : There is high correlation between the surface anatomy distances and the arterial path lengths they represent; however, these are not equal. Most surface anatomy measurements require adjustment using the formulae that we have provided, to accurately estimate the true distance travelled by the pulse wave."

There is evidence globally that low-income communities experience higher levels of morbidity and mortality during the pandemic.    Methods  Age-standardized COVID-19 mortality in the eight sub-districts of Cape Town was compared by economic indicators taken from the most recent Census (unemployment rate, monthly income).    Results  The overall Standardized Death Rate (SDR) for COVID-19 in Cape Town was 1 640 per million, but there was wide variation across the different sub-districts. A linear relationship was seen between sub-districts with high poverty and high COVID-19 SDRs.    Conclusions  Low-income communities in Cape Town experienced higher levels of COVID-19 mortality. As we continue to contend with COVID-19, these communities need to be prioritized for access to quality health care."

Distance to health facility has proven to affect family planning (FP) service use in many Sub-Saharan countries. Studies show that women who reside closer to facilities offering family planning services are more likely to use modern contraceptives. However, researchers often test the theory of distance decay. This study analyzed the significance of proximity to family planning services, service availability, and quality of family planning services on modern contraceptive use in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.   We used a pool of four rounds of facility- and population-based survey data in Kinshasa from PMA2020 between 2014 and 2016. We used GPS coordinates to calculate the distance between the health facilities and households. We tested if women who live closer to service delivery points with higher level of availability and quality are more likely to use modern contraceptives or less likely to have unmet need for contraceptive services.    10,968 women were interviewed over four rounds of data collection. Our findings show that living closer to an SDP is not a determinant of modern contraceptive use or having unmet need for FP services. Lack of cognitive access, economic barriers, bypassing the closest facility, and sociocultural norms are strong barriers for women in Kinshasa to use modern contraceptives. Proximity to quality services did not necessarily result in increased FP use among women of reproductive age living in Kinshasa, thus suggesting that a bypass phenomenon may occur when obtaining modern contraceptive services.    This study notes that barriers other than proximity to access may be substantial determinants of contraceptive use or unmet need. More research should be conducted that directly measures multidimensional components of access in order to interpret women’s contraceptive seeking behaviors in urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa."
https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/4-20,02 Mar 2021,The effect of women’s bargaining power within couples on contraceptive use in Cameroon,"Dimitri Tchakounté Tchuimi,Benjamin Fomba Kamga",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,68,806,"The prevalence of contraception among married women, evaluated at 23%, is low in Cameroon. Maternal death rates, estimated at 782 deaths per 100,000 live births, are very worrying. The National Strategic Plan for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (2015-2020) and the Health Sector Strategy (2016-2027) focuses on increasing modern contraceptive prevalence as a means to reduce maternal death. This paper identifies women’s bargaining power as a factor that may stimulate contraceptive use. The objective of this study is to analyze the association between women's bargaining power within couples and modern contraceptive use.    The data used come from the fifth Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2018. Women’s bargaining power within couple is measured by a Woman Bargaining Power Composite Index (WBPCI) built through a multiple correspondence analysis. The logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between WBPCI and modern contraceptive use.    The results of the descriptive statistics show that women's bargaining power is higher among women who use contraception than for those who do not. The results of the logistic regression model show that an increase of WBPCI was significantly associated with higher chances of using a modern contraceptive method (OR = 1.352; 95% CI: 1.257, 1.454; p <0.01). The education of women is also a key determinant since educated women were at least two times more likely to use a modern contraceptive method than uneducated women.      To reduce high maternal death rates in Cameroon, public health policies should not only focus on the health system itself, but should also focus on social policies to empower women in the household."

It is critical to understand how much governments have devoted to health from domestic sources and how much growth might be realistic over time.    Using data from WHO’s Global Health Expenditure Database, we examined how the composition of current health expenditure changed by financing source and the sources of growth in health expenditures from 2000-2015 across different income groups. We disaggregated how much growth in government expenditures on health from domestic sources was due to economic growth, growth in government spending as a share of GDP, and reallocations in government expenditures towards health.    Lower MICs (LMICs) and upper MICs (UMICs), as a group, saw a significant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures and a significant growth in government expenditures on health from domestic sources as a share of current health expenditures over the period. This trend indicates likely progress in the pathway to UHC. For LICs, these trends were more muted. Growth in government expenditure on health from domestic sources was driven primarily by economic growth in LICs, LMICs, and UMICs. Growth in government expenditure on health due to increased government spending as a share of GDP was high in UMICs. For the high-income country group, where economic growth was relatively slower and government spending was already high with strong tax bases, the largest driver of growth in government expenditure on health from domestic sources was reallocation of the government budget towards health.    Dialogue on domestic resource mobilization needs to emphasize overall economic growth and growth in the government spending as a share of GDP as well as the share of health in the government budget."

The fitness-for-purpose flow chart for assessing the appropriateness for use of different COVID-19 models was developed jointly by the CMCC Technical Group and Policy Group.   A flow chart of key questions to assess the fitness-for-purpose of commonly used COVID-19 epidemiological models was developed, with focus placed on their use in LMICs. Furthermore, each model was summarised with a description of the main characteristics, as well as the level of engagement and expertise required to use or adapt these models to LMIC settings.    This work formalises a process for engagement with models, which is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with recommendations for both policymakers and model developers and should improve modelling use in policy decision making."

Darmstadt",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,38,443,"Serious infections and other complications from very low birth weight and prematurity are the leading causes of death for neonates worldwide. Infections partly result from the compromised skin barrier function in preterm neonates. Optimal skin care practices for neonates, especially in settings with limited access to adequate hygienic conditions, hold potential to reduce infection and avoid these preventable preterm neonatal deaths. The purpose of this protocol is to support a scoping review of neonatal skin care, emollient therapy and massage practices throughout sub-Saharan Africa.   The proposed review will follow a methodological framework consisting of the following five steps: (i) identifying the research question, (ii) identifying relevant studies, (iii) selection of eligible studies, (iv) charting the data, and (v) collating and summarizing the results. In addition, we will reflect on the implications of the findings for the feasibility and design of randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of emollient therapy on survival, growth, infection and neurodevelopment of very low birth weight infants in sub-Saharan Africa. We will search domestic and international databases for literature published in English between January 1, 2000, and July 12, 2021. Articles will be chosen based on standardized inclusion criteria. The primary criteria for inclusion will be a report on skin care practices administered to neonates in Africa.   Documentation of common neonatal skin care practices throughout Africa has the potential to highlight opportunities for skin care intervention and future research on neonatal skin care practices in sub-Saharan Africa, and support the development of future emollient intervention trials for preterm and low birthweight neonates in low- and middle-income countries."

This paper reviews pregnancy surveillance methods used in Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) in low- and middle-income countries.    We searched articles containing information about pregnancy identification methods used in HDSSs published between January 2002 and October 2019 using PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 37 articles were included through literature review and 22 additional articles were identified via manual search of references. We reviewed the gray literature, including websites, online reports, data collection instruments, and HDSS protocols from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Study (CHAMPS) Network and the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH). In total, we reviewed information from 52 HDSSs described in 67 sources.   Substantial variability exists in pregnancy surveillance approaches across the 52 HDSSs, and surveillance methods are not always clearly documented. 42% of HDSSs applied restrictions based on residency duration to identify who should be included in surveillance. Most commonly, eligible individuals resided in the demographic surveillance area (DSA) for at least three months. 44% of the HDSSs restricted eligibility for pregnancy surveillance based on a woman’s age, with most only monitoring women 15-49 years. 10% had eligibility criteria based on marital status, while 11% explicitly included unmarried women in pregnancy surveillance. 38% allowed proxy respondents to answer questions about a woman’s pregnancy status in her absence. 20% of HDSSs supplemented pregnancy surveillance with investigations by community health workers or key informants and by linking HDSS data with data from antenatal clinics.    Methodological guidelines for conducting pregnancy surveillance should be clearly documented and meticulously implemented, as they can have implications for data quality and accurately informing maternal and child health programs."

One way to improve both satisfaction with and continuation of contraceptive usage is to increase the level of shared decision-making around method choice. In this study, we sought to evaluate the extent to which patients in urban Ghana experienced shared decision-making and if this was associated with method chosen, satisfaction, or continuation of the method at three-months post-visit.   We conducted a longitudinal survey. Women were recruited when they were starting a new method of contraception and followed-up with at three-months post-initiation from five family planning clinics in Accra and Kumasi, Ghana. Participants were asked who made the decision about their method choice, the patient herself, the provider, or the patient and provider together. Our outcomes included measures of satisfaction and three months’ continuation.    Fifty-eight percent of our participants reported making the decision of which method to use themselves, and eighty percent reported being satisfied to be leaving with their chosen method. At three months, those who reported they engaged in shared decision-making were more likely to report they would choose the same method again (p=.003), a measure of satisfaction. Patients who reported they made the decision of which method to use (p=.002) and those who left with an injection or pill (p=.019) rated their provider less favorably, while participants who had used a method before (p=.024) and those who reported they received their method of choice (p=.000) rated their providers more favorably.    Measured in multiple ways, women who made the decision of which method to use were less satisfied. These results show the importance of providers engaging with patients during the contraceptive decision-making process."

Gill",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,51,520,"Accurate patient identification is essential for delivering longitudinal care. Our team developed an ear biometric system (SEARCH) to improve patient identification. To address how ear growth affects matching rates longitudinally, we constructed an infant cohort, obtaining ear image sets monthly to map a 9-month span of observations. This analysis had three main objectives: 1) map trajectory of ear growth during the first 9 months of life; 2) determine the impact of ear growth on matching accuracy; and 3) explore computer vision techniques to counter a loss of accuracy.      Infants were enrolled from an urban clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. Roughly half were enrolled at their first vaccination visit and ~half at their last vaccination. Follow-up visits for each patient occurred monthly for 6 months. At each visit, we collected four images of the infant’s ears, and the child’s weight. We analyze ear area   age and change in ear area   age. We conduct pair-wise comparisons for all age intervals.    From 227 enrolled infants we acquired age-specific datasets for 6 days through 9 months. Maximal ear growth occurred between 6 days and 14 weeks. Growth was significant until 6 months of age, after which further growth appeared minimal. Examining look-back performance to the 6-month visit, baseline pair-wise comparisons yielded identification rates that ranged 46.9–75%. Concatenating left and right ears per participant improved identification rates to 61.5–100%. Concatenating images captured on adjacent visits further improved identification rates to 90.3–100%. Lastly, combining these two approaches improved identification to 100%. All matching strategies showed the weakest matching rates during periods of maximal growth ( ., <6 months).    By quantifying the effect that ear growth has on performance of the SEARCH platform, we show that ear identification is a feasible solution for patient identification in an infant population 6 months and above."

Prognosis among moderate to late (32  to <37   weeks’ gestation) preterm infants (MLPT) is better compared to their counterparts born very preterm (<32   weeks’ gestation). However the risk of developmental impairment among MLPT, who make up about 84% of all preterm infants, is 2-3 times higher when compared to infants born at term.  Early interventions have aimed to improve outcomes in preterm infants generally, but there are limited data on their need and effect in MLPT specifically. Prioritising research, long-term follow-up and early interventions targeted at ameliorating the impact of preterm birth among MLPT is required.   To conduct a systematic review of the type of early childhood interventions (from birth until 4 years of age) offered to  MLPT children and to evaluate their impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes (cognitive, neurobehavioural and motor) as assessed in these children during childhood (until 18 years of age).

https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/5-95,22 Sep 2021,Recognizing and mediating bureaucratic barriers: increasing access to care through small and medium-sized private providers in Kenya,"Lauren Suchman,Edward Owino,Dominic Montagu",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,42,492,"Equitable access to health services can be constrained in countries where private practitioners make up a large portion of primary care providers. Expanding purchasing arrangements has helped many countries integrate private providers into government-supported payment schemes, reducing financial barriers to care. However, private providers often must go through an onerous accreditation process to enroll in these schemes. The difficulties of this process are exacerbated where health policy is changed often and low-level bureaucrats must navigate these shifts at their own discretion. This paper analyzes one initiative to increase private provider accreditation with social health insurance (SHI) in Kenya by creating an intermediary between providers and “street-level” SHI bureaucrats.    This paper draws on 126 semi-structured interviews about SHI accreditation experience with private providers who were members of a franchise network in Kenya. It also draws on four focus group discussions conducted with franchise representatives who provided accreditation support to the providers and served as liaisons between the franchised providers and local SHI offices. There was a total of 20 participants across all four focus groups.    In a governance environment where regulations are weak and impermanent, street-level bureaucrats often created an accreditation process that was inconsistent and opaque. Support from the implementing organizations increased communication between SHI officials and providers, which clarified rules and increased providers’ confidence in the system. The intermediaries also reduced bureaucrats’ ability to apply regulations at will and helped to standardize the accreditation process for both providers and bureaucrats.    We conclude that intermediary organizations can mitigate institutional weaknesses and facilitate process efficiency. However, intermediaries only have a temporary role to play where there is potential to: 1) directly increase private providers’ power in a complex regulatory system; 2) reform the system itself to be more responsive to the limitations of on-the-ground implementation."

In each country 10-15 experts on the family planning program completed a 35-item questionnaire, first in 2014 in 89 countries, and in 2017 in 84 countries. Data were entered in Excel, with checks for consistency and data quality. The total score, and scores for each of 5 dimensions of effort are averages across the 35 indicators. Analytic techniques included cross-tabulations, graphical and correlation approaches.     The average total score for all countries in 2017 was 64 of the maximum of 100 of effort. Sub-regions differed: Anglophone and Francophone sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) scored highest in the total score and across all 5 dimensions. Next in order came Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Despite large differences in scores, the sub-regions followed similar profiles across the 35  indicators.    The long term rise in the basic family planning effort scores continued, extending the series from surveys approximately every five years beginning in the 1980s. The highest score reached was for the strategy dimension, but the others were close. Their relative levels remained essentially the same as in the 2014 survey.                        NCIFP scores correlated positively with modern contraceptive use in both the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and non-sub-Saharan Africa (non-SSA) countries, but the relationships were stronger for SSA. Access to long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs) was accompanied by greater LAPM use and modern method use.     Repeated surveys in most developing countries show improvements in family planning effort, though unevenly, by 35 indicators and across regions."

This study describes public sector providers’ experiences with implant and IUD removals in two districts of Senegal.   We conducted a cross-sectional study with providers trained to insert implants and IUDs from all public facilities offering long-acting reversible contraceptives. Data collection elements included a survey with 55 providers and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with eight other providers. We performed descriptive analysis of survey responses and analyzed qualitative data thematically.   Nearly all providers surveyed were trained in both implant and IUD insertion and removal; 42% had received training in the last two years. Over 90% of providers felt confident inserting and removing implants and removing IUDs; 15% were not confident removing non-palpable implants and 27% IUDs with non-visible strings. Challenges causing providers to refer clients or postpone removals include lack of consumables (38%) for implants, and short duration of use for implants (35%) and IUDs (20%). Many providers reported counseling clients presenting for removals to keep their method (58% implant, 31% IUD), primarily to attempt managing side effects. Among providers with removal experience, 78% had ever received a removal client with a deeply-placed implant and 33% with an IUD with non-visible strings. Qualitative findings noted that providers were willing to remove implants and IUDs before their expiration date but first attempted treatment or counseling to manage side effects. Providers reported lack of equipment and supplies as challenges, and mixed success with difficult removals.   Findings on provider capacity to perform insertions and regular removals are positive overall. Potential areas for improvement include availability of equipment and supplies, strengthening of counseling on side effects, and support for managing difficult removals."

We then conducted a mixed-methods case study of Rwanda using the framework to explore its utility in understanding the steps the country took in EBI-related decision-making and implementation between 2000-2015, key contextual factors which hindered or facilitated success, and to extract actionable knowledge for other countries working to reduce U5M.   : While relevant frameworks were identified, none individually covered the scope needed to understand Rwanda’s actions and success. Building on these frameworks, we combined and adapted relevant frameworks to capture exploration, planning, implementation, contextual factors in LMICs such as Rwanda, and outcomes beyond effectiveness and coverage. Utilizing our hybrid framework in Rwanda, we studied multiple EBIs and identified a common pathway and cross-cutting strategies and contextual factors that supported the country’s success in reducing U5M through the health system EBIs. Using these findings, we identified transferable lessons for other countries working to accelerate reduction in U5M.   : We found that a hybrid framework building on and adapting existing frameworks was successful in guiding data collection and interpretation of results, emerging new insights into how and why Rwanda achieved equitable introduction and implementation of health system EBIs that contributed to the decline in U5M, and generated lessons for countries working to drop U5M."

Available data from murine studies suggest that intestinal bacteria may have a role in modulating growth phenotypes in the host. We investigated the prevalence of four gut bacteria known in murine models to impair growth ( and  ), the level of fecal biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and stunting in rural Malawian children.      DNA and protein were extracted from fecal samples of rural Malawian children (aged 1-59 months) at a baseline cross-sectional survey in the Mangochi district of Malawi conducted within the framework of the Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR) trial. Intestinal carriage of bacteria was measured by PCR. Neopterin (NEO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), biomarkers of EED, were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Height-for-age Z (HAZ) score <-2 defined stunting. Tests of proportions and regression models were used to explore the relationship between bacterial carriage, EED, and stunting.     . Fecal samples from 613 children were available for laboratory analyses.   and   were prevalent in over 70% of children while   was the least prevalent.   carriage in younger children was associated with elevated EED biomarkers. Two thirds of children had elevated NEO, 33% had elevated MPO, and 16% had elevated AAT. Stunting was found in 38%. No significant associations were found between EED biomarkers or intestinal bacteria carriage and stunting.      Intestinal carriage of these four bacteria was not associated with stunting in Malawian children. Carriage was also not associated with EED, nor EED biomarker levels associated with stunting. Further factors acting in concert are necessary to impact EED, perturb growth, and alter gut bacterial carriage."

Demand creation is needed to increase PrEP uptake of this novel prevention technology. Theoretically-grounded formative research (FR) could identify factors to include in a demand creation campaign to motivate young South African women to seek PrEP.    Thirty-four household visits with young women (aged 16–32) were conducted in a township near Cape Town using Behavior Centered Design (BCD), investigating behavior contexts, the social and family environments and psychological processes, using qualitative and interactive tools, such as forced choice dilemmas, ranking games, daily script elicitation and network- and community drawings.    The FR generated findings concerning a wide variety of topic areas and identified a range of opportunities as well as challenges for the successful implementation of PrEP promotion in this population. Potential challenges were young women underestimating the consequences of acquiring HIV; taking medicine to prevent a disease (which was an unfamiliar concept) and young women having few responsibilities, making health care seeking and daily pill-taking with PrEP challenging. Potential opportunities that could be leveraged for PrEP demand creation were young women’s desire for trust and emotional closeness in relationships and the limited existing roles for young women, which could provide room for creating new aspirational roles that would motivate young women to take PrEP.    A theory-based and context-specific approach to FR led to a broad understanding of the lives and influences on young South African women and generated a comprehensive set of opportunities for intervention."

Zimmerman,Celia Karp,Fredrick Makumbi,Caroline Moreau",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,56,391,"Little is known regarding the specific role of covert use (i.e., use of contraception without partner knowledge) in contraceptive discontinuation and switching. Among a nationally representative cohort of women in Uganda, we sought to: 1) compare characteristics of covert, overt, and non-users of contraception at baseline; 2) assess the effect of using contraception covertly on switching and discontinuation over a one-year period.   Analyses utilized PMA2020 Uganda Round 6 (April–May 2018), with longitudinal analyses incorporating data from a one-year follow-up survey (May–June 2019). Both cross-sectional (n=1,764) and longitudinal (n=616) samples included women in need of contraception. For cross-sectional analyses, multinomial regression compared risk of overt/covert use vs. non-use by user characteristics and logistic regression compared the odds of covert vs. overt use among contraceptive users. For longitudinal analyses, multinomial regression examined risk of contraceptive switching and discontinuation by baseline covert vs. overt use status.   Among contraceptive users, 14.1% reported using covertly. In cross-sectional analyses, higher wealth (aRRR=1.74; 95% CI=1.19-2.54), secondary or higher education (aRRR=2.52; 95% CI=1.42-4.49), and middle parity (aRRR=1.24; 95% CI=1.00, 2.28) were associated with an increased risk of overt use, and higher wealth (aRRR=2.08; 95% CI=1.09-3.98) and polygyny (aRRR=1.60; 95% CI=1.01-2.54) with covert use, compared to non-use. Among contraceptive users, women within polygynous unions had double the odds of using covertly compared to those with monogamous partners (aOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.28-3.03). Longitudinal analyses revealed large proportions of overt and covert users switched (30% overt, 26% covert) or discontinued methods (32% overt, 37% covert) at one-year follow-up, however, neither switching nor discontinuation was significantly related to overt/covert use status at baseline.   Though significant differences by covert use status were not detected, approximately 33% of users discontinued over one year; these women represent important beneficiaries of family planning programming as they may remain at risk for unintended pregnancy."

The PPFP services are available only in limited health facilities and were not integrated in Antenatal care (ANC), Postnatal care (PNC), childbirth and immunization services. Provision of family planning counseling during the ANC period is not recorded in the ANC card.  Male partners do not participate in family planning counseling. Similarly, the uptake of family planning services at immunization, child health, and postnatal clinics is not recorded.   : This analysis provided evidence of the current status of PPFP in the country. There are gaps and challenges especially in strategy and guidelines, training, regular supply of commodities, awareness of PPFP, recording and reporting of PPFP. These gaps should be addressed with appropriate strategies."

When estimating the impact of additional strategies to reduce pertussis burden through modelling, duration of immunity conferred by childhood immunization is among the parameters models are most sensitive to. We aim to assess the duration of immunity of currently available wP vaccines in children and the additional protection conferred by booster doses.   : We conducted a systematic review of published studies of current commercially available vaccines indexed in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Lilacs, SciELO and Central until September 2021. We included clinical trials, observational longitudinal, and cross-sectional studies. Citation screening, data extraction, and risk of bias and methodological quality assessment were done in duplicate by independent reviewers, following the study protocol registered in PROSPERO. Studies were included if they reported primary data on the protection, immunity, or duration of immunity conferred by ≥3 doses of wP vaccine in healthy children, without restriction to time or location of the study. Outcomes included clinical events or serological evidence of protection.   : We included 12 studies conducted from 2007-2020 with heterogeneous methodological quality. Studies report on 5 of the 18 currently available wP vaccines in use. After primary immunization, geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-pertussis toxin ranged from 9.1 EU/mL (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 8.1-10.2) to 50.9 (95%CI: 45.9-56.4). Prior to the 1st booster, GMC titers were low ranging from 4.7 to 10 EU/mL, and after the 1st booster averaged around 42 EU/mL.   : The limited available evidence on immunogenicity of currently available wP vaccines reinforces the need for booster doses and suggests that the duration of wP immunity is short, probably <5 years. This is important information for vaccination policy makers, investigators and modelers.  PROSPERO registration:"

Whether these profiles precede the infection or a consequence of it, is unknown. In order to answer this question, longitudinal studies are needed.    We conducted an analysis of a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 1,981 Zambian mother-infant pairs who underwent NP sampling from 1-week through 14-weeks of age at 2-3-week intervals. Ten of the infants in the cohort who developed LRTI were matched 1:3 with healthy comparators. We completed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the samples each of these infants contributed, as well as from baseline samples of the infants’ mothers, and characterized the normal maturation of the healthy infant NP microbiome, compared to infants who developed LRTI.    The infant NP microbiome maturation was characterized by transitioning from   dominant to respiratory-genera dominant profiles during the first three months of life, similar to what is described in the literature. Interestingly, infants who developed LRTI had NP dysbiosis before infection, in most cases as early as the first week of life. Dysbiosis was characterized by the presence of    , high relative abundance of  , and low relative abundance of compared to the healthy controls. Mothers of infants with LRTI also had low relative abundance of   in their baseline samples compared to mothers of infants that did not develop an LRTI.    Our results suggest that NP microbiome dysbiosis precedes LRTI in young infants and may be present in their mothers as well. Early dysbiosis may play a role in the causal pathway leading to LRTI or could be a marker of other pathogenic forces that directly lead to LRTI."

The 2019 LBW estimates indicated a global prevalence of 14.6% (20.5 million newborns) in 2015. We aim to develop updated LBW estimates at global, regional, and national levels for up to 202 countries for the period of 2000 to 2020.    Two types of sources for LBW data will be sought: national administrative data and population-based surveys. Administrative data will be searched for countries with a facility birth rate ≥80% and included when birthweight data account for ≥80% of UN estimated live births for that country and year. Surveys with birthweight data published since release of the 2019 edition of the LBW estimates will be adjusted using the standard methodology applied for the previous estimates. Risk of bias assessments will be undertaken. Covariates will be selected based on a conceptual framework of plausible associations with LBW, covariate time-series data quality, collinearity between covariates and correlations with LBW. National LBW prevalence will be estimated using a Bayesian multilevel-mixed regression model, then aggregated to derive regional and global estimates through population-weighted averages.    Whilst availability of LBW data has increased, especially with more facility births, gaps remain in the quantity and quality of data, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. Challenges include high percentages of missing data, lack of adherence to reporting standards, inaccurate measurement, and data heaping. Updated LBW estimates are important to highlight the global burden of LBW, track progress towards nutrition targets, and inform investments in programmes. Reliable, nationally representative data are key, alongside investments to improve the measurement and recording of an accurate birthweight for every baby."

Our objective was to identify countries who improved family planning coverage in the last 40 years and investigate which contexts enabled those advances.   Methods   Analyses were based on data from publicly available national health surveys carried out since 1986 in Egypt, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Brazil, and Ecuador, selected based on previous evidence. We estimated demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods (mDFPS) for each country and explored inequalities in terms of wealth, women’s education, and women’s age. We also explored contextual differences in terms of women’s empowerment, percentage of population living in extreme poverty, and share of each type of contraceptive. To better understand political and sociocultural contexts, country case studies were included, based on literature review.   Results   Patterns of mDFPS increase were distinct in the selected countries. Current level of mDFPS coverage ranged between 94% in Brazil and 38% in Afghanistan. All countries experienced an important reduction in both gender inequality and extreme poverty. According to the share of each type of contraceptive, most countries presented higher use of short-acting reversible methods. Exceptions were Ecuador, where the most used method is sterilization, and Egypt, which presented higher use of long-acting reversible methods. In the first years analyzed, all countries presented huge gaps in coverage according to wealth, women’s education and women’s age. All countries managed to increase coverage over recent years, especially among women from the more disadvantaged groups.   Conclusions   Family planning coverage increased along with reductions in poverty and gender inequality, with substantial increases in coverage among the most disadvantaged in recent years. Policies involving primary health care services, provision of various methods, and high quality training of health providers are crucial to increase coverage."

Despite increased DAH spending, intractable health challenges remain. Recent decades have seen numerous efforts to reform DAH models, yet pernicious challenges persist amidst structural complexities and a growing number of actors. Systems-based approaches are promising for understanding these types of complex adaptive systems. This paper presents a systems-based understanding of DAH, including barriers to achieving sustainable and effective country-driven models for technical assistance and capacity strengthening to achieve better outcomes   We applied an innovative systems-based approach to explore and map how donor structures, processes, and norms pose challenges to improving development assistance models. The system mapping was carried out through an iterative co-creation process including a series of discussions and workshops with diverse stakeholders across 13 countries.    Nine systemic challenges emerged: 1) reliance on external implementing partners undermines national capacity; 2) prioritizing global initiatives undercuts local programming; 3) inadequate contextualization hampers program sustainability; 4) decision-maker blind spots inhibit capacity to address inequities; 5) power asymmetries undermine local decision making; 6) donor funding structures pose limitations downstream; 7) program fragmentation impedes long-term country planning; 8) reliance on incomplete data perpetuates inequities; and 9) overemphasis on donor-prioritized data perpetuates fragmentation.   These interconnected challenges illustrate interdependencies and feedback loops manifesting throughout the system. A particular driving force across these system barriers is the influence of power asymmetries between actors. The articulation of these challenges can help stakeholders overcome biases about the efficacy of the system and their role in perpetuating the issues. These findings indicate that change is needed not only in how we design and implement global health programs, but in how system actors interact. This requires co-creating solutions that shift the structures, norms, and mindsets governing DAH models."
