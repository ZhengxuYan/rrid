P.; Mazel, D.']","integrons are genetic elements involved in bacterial adaptation. they can capture, shuffle and express adaptive functions embedded in cassettes. these events are governed by the integron integrase through site-specific recombination between attc and atti integron sites. here, we demonstrated that the integrase can efficiently catalyze insertion of cassettes in bacterial genomes, outside the att sites. we showed that, once inserted in genomes, cassettes can be expressed, if located near bacterial promoters, and can be excised at the insertion point and even outside, inducing chromosomal modifications in the latter case. analysis of more than 5 x 105 independent insertion events revealed a very large genomic insertion landscape with recombination sites greatly different, in terms of sequence and structure, from classical att sites. we named these new sites attg. these results unveil a new efficient route for dissemination of adaptive functions and expand the role of integrons in bacterial evolution."

C.; McKeown, C. R.; Cline, H. T.']","in developing xenopus tadpoles, the optic tectum begins to receive patterned visual input while visuomotor circuits are still undergoing neurogenesis and circuit assembly. this visual input regulates neural progenitor cell fate decisions such that maintaining tadpoles in the dark increases proliferation, expanding the progenitor pool, while visual stimulation promotes neuronal differentiation. to identify regulators of activity-dependent neural progenitor cell fate, we used rna-seq to profile the transcriptomes of proliferating neural progenitor cells and newly-differentiated immature neurons. out of 1,130 differentially expressed (de) transcripts, we identified six de transcription factors which are predicted to regulate the majority of the other de transcripts. here we focused on breast cancer 1 (brca1) and the ets-family transcription factor, elk-1. brca1 is known for its role in cancers, but relatively little is known about its potential role in regulating neural progenitor cell fate. elk-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor which regulates immediate early gene expression. we investigated the effect of brca1 and elk-1 on activity-regulated neurogenesis in the tadpole visual system using in vivo time-lapse imaging to monitor the fate of turbo-gfp-expressing sox2+ neural progenitor cells in the optic tectum. our longitudinal in vivo imaging analysis shows that knockdown of either brca1 or elk-1 altered the fates of neural progenitor cells, and furthermore that the effects of visual experience on neurogenesis depend on brca1 expression, while the effects of visual experience on neuronal differentiation depend on elk-1 expression. these studies provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which neural activity affects neural progenitor cell fate."

J.']","plane-form enamel hypoplasia (pfeh) is a severe dental defect in which large areas of the crown are devoid of enamel. this condition is rare in humans and rarer in wild primates. the etiology of pfeh has been linked to exposure to severe disease, malnutrition, environmental toxins, and other systemic conditions. similar defects have also been associated with genetic conditions such as amelogenesis imperfecta. in this study, we examined the prevalence of all types of enamel hypoplasia in several populations of wild japanese macaques (macaca fuscata) with the aim of providing context for the severe defects found in macaques from yakushima island. we found that macaques from other islands and from the mainland of japan have low prevalence of the more common types of enamel hypoplasia and none exhibit pfeh. in contrast, 10 of the 21 individuals (48%) from yakushima island displayed uniform and significant pfeh, with all 10 living in two adjacent locations in the south of the island. all permanent teeth were affected to varying degrees except for first molars, and the mineral content of the remaining enamel in teeth with pfeh is normal (i.e., no hypo- or hyper mineralization). given that the affected individuals have smaller first molars compared to non-affected macaques, and that they all underwent dental development during a period of substantial human-related habitat change, we conclude that the pfeh likely resulted from environmental stress. extreme weather events on the island may also have influenced the formation of these defects. additionally, it is plausible that a documented recent population bottleneck could have heightened the susceptibility of these macaques to pfeh. further research on living primate populations is needed to better understand the causes of pfeh in wild primates and to evaluate whether such features can be used to assess the impact of human-related disturbance."

G.']","frequency selectivity is a fundamental property of the peripheral auditory system; however, the invasiveness of auditory nerve (an) experiments limits its study in the human ear. compound action potentials (caps) associated with forward-masking have been suggested as an alternative means to assess cochlear frequency selectivity. previous methods relied on an empirical comparison of an and cap tuning curves in animal models, arguably not taking full advantage of the information contained in forward-masked caps. in this work, we seek to provide a direct estimate of the quality factor characterizing an frequency tuning using many forward-masked cap responses. the method is based on a convolution model of the cap that takes into account the masking of an populations induced by notched-noise maskers with various notch widths and attenuations. the model produces masking patterns that, once convolved by a unitary response, predict forward-masked cap waveforms. model parameters, including those characterizing frequency selectivity, are fine-tuned by minimizing waveform prediction errors across the different masking conditions, yielding robust estimates. the method was applied to click-evoked caps at the round window of anesthetized chinchillas. the estimated quality factor q10 as a function of center frequency is shown to closely match the average quality factor obtained from an-fiber tuning curves, without the need for an empirical correction factor. beyond the estimation of frequency selectivity, the proposed model proves to be accurate in predicting forward-masked cap responses, and therefore could be extended to study more complex aspects of cochlear signal processing using a similar experimental approach."

L.']","social behaviors, like other motivated behaviors, frequently consist of a flexible motivated-seeking or approach phase followed by social action. dysregulated social behavior may arise from changes to motivation, wherein individuals fail to enter a motivated seeking state, or may be in the execution of the social action itself. however, it is unclear how the brain generates and gates this flexible motivation-to-action sequence, and whether aggressive motivation and action are controlled by separate circuit mechanisms. here, we record populations of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateral area (vmhvl) of male mice at cellular resolution during ""free"" aggression and also during an aggression operant task, where the behaviors that precede attack are stereotyped. we find that this population encodes the temporal sequence of aggressive motivation to action and that the temporal selectivity of neurons is invariant to differences in motivated behavior. to test whether motivation and action could be independently regulated, we focused on two key inhibitory inputs to the vmhvl: a source of local inhibition (vmhvl shell) and the primary source of long-range inhibition (the medial preoptic area, mpo). while we find that the vmhvl receives broad monosynaptic inhibitory input from both inputs, optogenetic perturbation of these inputs during recording reveals temporal selectivity during aggressive motivation and action, suggesting specificity of function. encoding models applied to population calcium recordings of these inhibitory inputs during naturalistic social interactions and during the social operant task further reveal that these inputs have different temporal dynamics during aggression: vmhvl shellvgat+ activity peaks at the start of aggressive interactions, while mpo-vmhvlvgat+ activity peaks at behaviorally aligned endpoints of aggressive interactions. finally, using closed-loop optogenetic stimulation timed to specific phases of the aggression-operant task, we find a double-dissociation of the effects on aggressive motivation and action: activation of mpo-vmhvlvgat+, even briefly and temporally distant from the initiation of aggression, produces long-lasting motivational deficits, delaying the initiation of aggression and generating behaviors consistent with an unmotivated state. in contrast, activation of vmhvl shellvgat+ produces acute action-related deficits, causing an exit from an attack state. fitting a hidden markov model (hmm) to behavior further corroborates these findings by showing that mpo-vmhvlvgat+ stimulation prolongs a low motivation state and vmhvl shellvgat+ promotes exit from an attack state. together, these data demonstrate how separable inhibitory circuits in the hypothalamus can independently gate the motivational and action phases of aggression through a single locus of control."

N.']","we introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the neocortex. the model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. as a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). we tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation creates low-dimensional combinations of a set of learned temporal dynamics to explain input sequences. when trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed spacetime receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. additionally, the networks hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., in the flash-lag illusion). when coupled with an associative memory emulating the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. when extended to three hierarchical levels, the model learned progressively more abstract temporal representations along the hierarchy. taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.  author summarythe brain is adept at predicting stimuli and events at multiple timescales. how do the neuronal networks in the brain achieve this remarkable capability? we propose that the neocortex employs dynamic predictive coding to learn hierarchical spatiotemporal representations. using computer simulations, we show that when exposed to natural videos, a hierarchical neural network that minimizes prediction errors develops stable and longer timescale responses at the higher level; lower-level neurons learn space-time receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of primary visual cortical cells. the same network also exhibits several effects in visual motion processing and supports cue-triggered activity recall. our results provide a new framework for understanding the genesis of temporal response hierarchies and activity recall in the neocortex."

L.; Neugebauer, B.; Flores-Felix, K.; Keller, A.; Carrasquillo, Y.; Cramer, N.']","the transition from acute to chronic pain involves maladaptive plasticity in central nociceptive pathways. growing evidence suggests that changes within the parabrachial nucleus (pbn), an important component of the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid pain pathway, are key contributors to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. in animal models of chronic pain, pbn neurons become sensitive to normally innocuous stimuli and responses to noxious stimuli become amplified and more often produce after-discharges that outlast the stimulus. using ex vivo slice electrophysiology and two mouse models of neuropathic pain, sciatic cuff and chronic constriction of the infraorbital nerve (cci-ion), we find that changes in the firing properties of pbn neurons and a shift in inhibitory synaptic transmission may underlie this phenomenon. compared to pbn neurons from shams, a larger proportion of pbn neurons from mice with a sciatic cuff were spontaneously active at rest, and these same neurons showed increased excitability relative to shams. in contrast, quiescent pbn neurons from cuff mice were less excitable than those from shams. despite an increase in excitability in a subset of pbn neurons, the presence of after-discharges frequently observed in vivo were largely absent ex vivo in both injury models. however, gabab-mediated presynaptic inhibition of gabaergic terminals is enhanced in pbn neurons after cci-ion. these data suggest that the amplified activity of pbn neurons observed in rodent models of chronic pain arise through a combination of changes in firing properties and network excitability.  significance statementhyperactivity of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (pbn) is causally linked to exaggerated pain behaviors in rodent models of chronic pain but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. using two mouse models of neuropathic pain, we show the intrinsic properties of pbn neurons are largely unaltered following injury. however, subsets of pbn neurons become more excitable and gabab receptor mediated suppression of inhibitory terminals is enhanced after injury. thus, shifts in network excitability may be a leading factor in injury induced potentiation of pbn activity."

C.']","5-methylcytosine (5mc) is a modified base often described as necessary for the proper regulation of genes and transposons and for the maintenance of genome integrity in plants. however, the extent of this dogma is limited by the current phylogenetic sampling of land plant species diversity. here, we report that a monocot plant, spirodela polyrhiza, has lost cg gene body methylation, genome-wide chh methylation, and the presence or expression of several genes in the highly conserved rna-directed dna methylation (rddm) pathway. it has also lost the chh methyltransferase chromomethylase 2. consequently, the transcriptome is depleted of 24-nucleotide, heterochromatic, small interfering rnas that act as guides for the deposition of 5mc to rddm-targeted loci in all other currently sampled angiosperm genomes. although the genome displays low levels of genome-wide 5mc primarily at ltr retrotransposons, cg maintenance methylation is still functional. in contrast, chg methylation is weakly maintained even though h3k9me2 is present at loci dispersed throughout the euchromatin and highly enriched at regions likely demarcating pericentromeric regions. collectively, these results illustrate that s. polyrhiza is maintaining cg and chg methylation mostly at repeats in the absence of small rnas. s. polyrhiza reproduces rapidly through clonal propagation in aquatic environments, which we hypothesize may enable low levels of maintenance methylation to persist in large populations.  significance statementdna methylation is a widespread chromatin modification that is regularly found in all plant species. by examining one aquatic duckweed species, spirodela polyrhiza, we find that it has lost highly conserved genes involved in methylation of dna at sites often associated with repetitive dna, and within genes, however dna methylation and heterochromatin is maintained during cell division at other sites. consequently, small rnas that normally guide methylation to silence repetitive dna like retrotransposons are diminished. despite the loss of a highly conserved methylation pathway, and the reduction of small rnas that normally target repetitive dna, transposons have not proliferated in the genome, perhaps due in part to the rapid, clonal growth lifestyle of duckweeds."

Langford-Avelar, A.; Lemieux, A.; McGraw, S.']","backgroundthe placenta is vital for fetal development and its contributions to various developmental issues, such as pregnancy complications, fetal growth restriction, and maternal exposure, have been extensively studied in mice. the placenta forms mainly from fetal tissue and therefore has the same biological sex as the fetus it supports. extensive research has delved into the placentas involvement in pregnancy complications and future offspring development, with a notable emphasis on exploring sex-specific disparities. however, despite these investigations, sex-based disparities in epigenetic (e.g., dna methylation) and transcriptomic features of the late-gestation mouse placenta remain largely unknown.  methodswe collected male and female mouse placentas at late gestation (e18.5, n = 3/sex) and performed next-generation sequencing to identify genome-wide sex differences in transcription and dna methylation.  resultsour comparison between male and female revealed 358 differentially expressed genes (degs) on autosomes, which were associated with signaling pathways involved in transmembrane transport and the responses to viruses and external stimuli. x chromosome degs (n = 39) were associated with different pathways, including those regulating chromatin modification and small gtpase-mediated signal transduction. differentially methylated regions (dmrs) were more common on the x chromosomes (n = 3756) than on autosomes (n = 1705). interestingly, while most x chromosome dmrs had higher dna methylation levels in female placentas and tended to be included in cpg dinucleotide-rich regions, 73% of autosomal dmrs had higher methylation levels in male placentas and were distant from cpg-rich regions. several degs were correlated with dmrs. a subset of the dmrs present in late-stage placentas were already established in mid-gestation (e10.5) placentas (n = 348 dmrs on x chromosome and 19 dmrs on autosomes), while others were acquired later in placental development.  conclusionour study provides comprehensive lists of degs and dmrs between male and female that collectively cause profound differences in the dna methylation and gene expression profiles of late-gestation mouse placentas. our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating sex-specific analyses into epigenetic and transcription studies to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their conclusions and help address the significant knowledge gap regarding how sex differences influence placental function.  highlightso_liin

the developing embryo, and therefore shares its sex. male fetuses have higher risks of pregnancy complications and neurodevelopmental disorders, and these risks are linked to placenta functions. however, how the placentas sex influences the proteins it contains--and therefore, how it helps the fetus develop--remains largely unknown. we used cutting-edge techniques to systematically examine late-pregnancy mouse placentas, cataloging the genes being expressed (i.e., sections of dna used to make proteins) and the patterns of a specific dna mark (called methylation) that controls gene expression. we identified several genes with important placental functions, such as protecting the fetus from viruses and responding to environmental changes, whose expression levels were sex-specific. we also observed differences in dna methylation between male and female placentas. most dna methylation differences were on the x-chromosomes associated with sex, and the majority had higher methylation levels in female placentas. conversely, on other chromosomes, most differences present an increased level of dna methylation in male placentas. as methylation affects gene expression, we found links between the changes. additionally, we found that some sex differences in the placenta were already present earlier in pregnancy. our findings provide important insights into the molecular differences between male and female mouse placentas during late pregnancy. including sex-specific analyses in placenta studies will improve our understanding of how the placenta ensures the healthy development of male and female fetuses."

G.']","the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) envelope glycoprotein (env) precursor (gp160) trimerizes, is modified by high-mannose glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is transported via golgi and non-golgi secretory pathways to the infected cell surface. in the golgi, gp160 is partially modified by complex carbohydrates and proteolytically cleaved to produce the mature functional env trimer, which is preferentially incorporated into virions. broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) generally recognize the cleaved env trimer, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies (pnabs) bind the conformationally flexible gp160. we found that expression of bnabs, pnabs or soluble/membrane forms of the receptor, cd4, in cells producing hiv-1 all decreased viral infectivity. four patterns of co-expressed ligand:env were observed: 1) ligands (cd4, soluble cd4-ig and some pnabs) that specifically recognize the cd4-bound env conformation resulted in uncleaved envs lacking complex glycans that were not incorporated into virions; 2) other pnabs produced envs with some complex carbohydrates and severe defects in cleavage, which were relieved by brefeldin a treatment; 3) bnabs that recognize gp160 as well as mature envs resulted in envs with some complex carbohydrates and moderate decreases in virion env cleavage; and 4) bnabs that preferentially recognize mature envs produced cleaved envs with complex glycans in cells and on virions. the low infectivity observed upon co-expression of pnabs or cd4 could be explained by disruption of env trafficking, reducing the level of env and/or increasing the fraction of uncleaved env on virions. in addition to bnab effects on virion env cleavage, the secreted bnabs neutralized the co-expressed viruses.  importancethe envelope glycoprotein (env) trimers on the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) mediate virus entry into host cells. env is synthesized in infected cells, modified by complex sugars and cleaved to form a mature, functional env, which is incorporated into virus particles. env elicits antibodies in infected individuals, some of which can neutralize the virus. we found that antibodies co-expressed in the virus-producing cell can disrupt env transit to the proper compartment for cleavage and sugar modification and, in some cases, block incorporation into viruses. these studies provide insights into the processes by which env becomes functional in the virus-producing cell and may assist attempts to interfere with these events to inhibit hiv-1 infection."

J.; Murillo, L. F.; Readey, J.; Mura, C.; Bourne, P. E.']","backgroundmachine learning (ml) has a rich history in structural bioinformatics, and modern approaches, such as deep learning, are revolutionizing our knowledge of the subtle relationships between biomolecular sequence, structure, function, dynamics and evolution. as with any advance that rests upon statistical learning approaches, the recent progress in biomolecular sciences is enabled by the availability of vast volumes of sufficiently-variable data. to be useful, such data must be well-structured, machine-readable, intelligible and manipulable. these and related requirements pose challenges that become especially acute at the computational scales typical in ml. furthermore, in structural bioinformatics such data generally relate to protein three-dimensional (3d) structures, which are inherently more complex than sequence-based data. a significant and recurring challenge concerns the creation of large, high-quality, openly-accessible datasets that can be used for specific training and benchmarking tasks in ml pipelines for predictive modeling projects, along with reproducible splits for training and testing.  resultshere, we report  prop3d, a platform that allows for the creation, sharing and extensible reuse of libraries of protein domains, featurized with biophysical and evolutionary properties that can range from detailed, atomically-resolved physicochemical quantities (e.g., electrostatics) to coarser, residue-level features (e.g., phylogenetic conservation). as a community resource, we also supply a  prop3d-20sf protein dataset, obtained by applying our approach to cath. we have developed and deployed the prop3d framework, both in the cloud and on local hpc resources, to systematically and reproducibly create comprehensive datasets via the highly scalable data service (hsds). our datasets are freely accessible via a public hsds instance, or they can be used with accompanying python wrappers for popular ml frameworks.  conclusionprop3d and its associated prop3d-20sf dataset can be of broad utility in at least three ways. firstly, the prop3d workflow code can be customized and deployed on various cloud-based compute platforms, with scalability achieved largely by saving the results to distributed hdf5 files via hsds. secondly, the linked prop3d-20sf dataset provides a hand-crafted, already-featurized dataset of protein domains for 20 highly-populated cath families; importantly, provision of this pre-computed resource can aid the more efficient development (and reproducible deployment) of ml pipelines. thirdly, prop3d-20sfs construction explicitly takes into account (in creating datasets and data-splits) the enigma of  data leakage, stemming from the evolutionary relationships between proteins."

F.; Laurichesse, Q.; Loudhaief, R.; Colombani, J.; Andersen, D. S.']","rapidly renewable tissues adapt different strategies to cope with environmental insults. while tissue repair is associated with increased isc proliferation and accelerated tissue turnover rates, reduced calorie intake triggers a homeostasis-breaking process causing adaptive resizing of the gut. here we show that activins are key drivers of both adaptive and regenerative growth. activin-{beta} (act-{beta}) is produced by progenitor cells in response to intestinal infections and stimulates isc proliferation and turnover rates to promote tissue repair. dawdle (daw), a divergent drosophila activin, signals through its receptor, baboc, in progenitor cells to promote their maturation into enterocytes (ecs). daw is dynamically regulated during starvation-refeeding cycles, where it couples nutrient intake with progenitor maturation and adaptive resizing of the gut. our results highlight an activin-dependent mechanism coupling nutrient intake with progenitor-to-ec maturation to promote adaptive resizing of the gut and further establish activins as key regulators of adult tissue plasticity."

G.']","biological age is typically estimated using biomarkers whose states have been observed to correlate with chronological age. a persistent limitation of such aging clocks is that it is difficult to establish how the biomarker states are related to the mechanisms of aging. somatic mutations could potentially form the basis for a more fundamental aging clock since the mutations are both markers and drivers of aging and have a natural timescale. cell lineage trees inferred from these mutations reflect the somatic evolutionary process and thus, it has been conjectured, the aging status of the body. such a timer has been impractical thus far, however, because detection of somatic variants in single cells presents a significant technological challenge. here we show that somatic mutations detected using single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) from thousands of cells can be used to construct a cell lineage tree whose structure correlates with chronological age. de novo single-nucleotide variants (snvs) are detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a modified protocol. a default model based on penalized multiple regression of chronological age on 31 metrics characterizing the phylogenetic tree gives a pearson correlation of 0.81 and a median absolute error of [~]4 years between predicted and chronological age. testing of the model on a public scrna-seq dataset yields a pearson correlation of 0.85. in addition, cell tree age predictions are found to be better predictors of certain clinical biomarkers than age alone, for instance glucose, albumin levels and leukocyte count. the geometry of the cell lineage tree records the structure of somatic evolution in the individual and represents a new modality of aging timer. in addition to providing a numerical estimate of  cell tree age, it unveils a temporal history of the aging process, revealing how clonal structure evolves over life span. cell tree rings complements existing aging clocks and may help reduce the current uncertainty in the assessment of geroprotective trials."
