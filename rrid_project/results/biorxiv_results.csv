Specifically, global warming could increase the probability of emerging infectious diseases, notably because of changes in the geographical and seasonal distributions of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. For example, the range of Ixodes ricinus, the most common and widespread tick species in Europe, is currently expanding northward and at higher altitudes. However, little is known about the seasonal variation in tick abundance in different climates. Seasonality of I. ricinus is often based on expert opinions while field surveys are usually limited in time. Our objective was to describe seasonal variations in I. ricinus abundance under different climates. To this end, a seven-year longitudinal study, with monthly collections of I. ricinus host-seeking nymphs, was carried out in France, in six locations corresponding to different climates. Tick data were log-transformed and grouped between years so as to obtain seasonal variations for a typical year. Daily average temperature was measured during the study period. Seasonal patterns of nymph abundance were established for the six different locations using linear harmonic regression. Model parameters were estimated separately for each location. Seasonal patterns appeared different depending on the climate considered. Western temperate sites showed an early spring peak, a summer minimum and a moderate autumn and winter abundance. More continental sites showed a later peak in spring, and a minimum in winter. The peak occurred in summer for the mountainous site, with an absence of ticks in winter. In all cases except the mountainous site, the timing of the spring peak could be related to the sum of degree days since the beginning of the year. Winter abundance was positively correlated to the corresponding temperature. Our results highlight clear patterns in the different sites corresponding to different climates, which allow further forecast of tick seasonality under changing climate conditions.",Thierry Hoch,INRAE

However, the influence of individual microbes on viral infections is not well understood. Here, we examined the impact of 67 naturally bacterial associates on Caenorhabditis elegans susceptibility to Orsay virus. Our findings reveal that viral infection of C. elegans is significantly influenced by monobacterial environments. The majority of tested natural bacterial environments reduced C. elegans viral infection while some increased susceptibility compared to an Escherichia coli environmental reference. The reduction in viral infection is not caused by degradation of the virions or poor nutrition of C. elegans by the bacteria. The reduction in viral infection does not require known antiviral responses, including RNA interference and transcriptional regulation downstream of the RIG-I homolog DRH-1. However, one bacterium, Lelliottia JUb276, reduced susceptibility but does not induce resistance to viral infection in drh-1 mutants. Our research underscores the importance of considering the natural biotic environment in studies of viral infections and provides insights for future research on host-microbes-virus interactions and viral immunity.

Badnavirids are found in plants as endogenous, inactive sequences, and/or in episomal (infectious and active) forms. To assess the state of RYNV infections, we sequenced the genomes of various Rubus cultivars and mined eight additional published whole genome sequencing datasets. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a diverse array of endogenous RYNV (endoRYNV) sequences that differ significantly in their structure; some lineages have nearly complete, yet non-functional genomes whereas others have rudimentary, small sequence fragments. We developed assays to genotype the six main endoRYNV lineages as well as the only known episomal lineage in commercial Rubus. This study discloses the widespread presence of endoRYNVs in commercial raspberries, likely because breeding programs have been using a limited pool of germplasm that harbored endoRYNVs.",Thien  Ho,Driscoll's Inc.

D.; Bannert, N.; Cingoz, O.",microbiology,2023-05-02,2024-01-05,"Viruses that carry a positive-sense, single-stranded (+ssRNA) RNA translate their genomes soon after entering the host cell to produce viral proteins, with the exception of retroviruses. A distinguishing feature of retroviruses is reverse transcription, where the +ssRNA genome serves as a template to synthesize a double-stranded DNA copy that subsequently integrates into the host genome. As retroviral RNAs are produced by the host cell transcriptional machinery and are largely indistinguishable from cellular mRNAs, we investigated the potential of incoming retroviral genomes to directly express proteins. Here we show through multiple, complementary methods that retroviral genomes are translated after entry. Our findings challenge the notion that retroviruses require reverse transcription to produce viral proteins. Synthesis of retroviral proteins in the absence of productive infection has significant implications for basic retrovirology, immune responses and gene therapy applications.",,

W.; Avril, M.",immunology,2023-05-23,2024-01-10,"Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide, despite control efforts that have lowered morbidity and mortality. The only P. falciparum vaccine candidates to show field efficacy are those targeting the asymptomatic pre-erythrocytic (PE) stages of infection. The subunit (SU) RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, the only licensed malaria vaccine to date, is only modestly effective against clinical malaria. Both RTS,S/AS01 and the SU R21 vaccine candidate target the PE sporozoite (spz) circumsporozoite (CS) protein. These candidates elicit high-titer antibodies that provide short-term protection from disease, but do not induce the liver-resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) that confer strong PE immunity and long-term protection. In contrast, whole-organism (WO) vaccines, employing for example radiation-attenuated spz (RAS), elicit both high antibody titers and Trm, and have achieved high levels of sterilizing protection. However, they require multiple intravenous (IV) doses, which must be administered at intervals of several weeks, complicating mass administration in the field. Moreover, the quantities of spz required present production difficulties. To reduce reliance on WO while maintaining protection via both antibodies and Trm responses, we have developed an accelerated vaccination regimen that combines two distinct agents in a prime-and-trap strategy. While the priming dose is a self-replicating RNA encoding P. yoelii CS protein, delivered via an advanced cationic nanocarrier (LIONTM), the trapping dose consists of WO RAS. This accelerated regime confers sterile protection in the P. yoelii mouse model of malaria. Our approach presents a clear path to late-stage preclinical and clinical testing of dose-sparing, same-day regimens that can confer sterilizing protection against malaria.",Marion Avril,"MalarVx, Inc"

B.",pathology,2023-02-27,2024-01-12,"Chuviruses (family Chuviridae), which are in the recently discovered order Jingchuvirales, were first identified in arthropods in 2015 and have been detected through metagenomics in numerous invertebrates, but only a few vertebrates. With only few metagenomically based detections in vertebrates, their replication competency in vertebrates remained questioned, let alone their pathological significance. This study identified three novel chuviruses as the etiology of lymphocytic meningoencephalomyelitis in three wild aquatic turtles: an alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys sp.), a Kemps ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii), and a loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). The application of random, deep sequencing successfully assembled the complete snapping turtle chuvirus-1 [STCV-1], Kemps ridley turtle chuvirus-1 [KTCV-1] genome, and loggerhead turtle chuvirus-1 [LTCV-1]) genome. The STCV-1 and KTCV-1 sequences were used to create custom RNAscope probes for in situ hybridization, which confirmed STCV-1, KTCV-1, and LTCV-1 (cross reactivity to the KTCV-1 probe) RNA within the inflamed region of the brain and spinal cord. STCV-1 and KTCV-1 were isolated on several turtle-origin cell lines. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that all three viruses clustered with other vertebrate chuviruses, all within the genus Piscichuvirus. With more than 91% pairwise amino acid identity of the polymerase proteins, STCV-1, KTCV-1, and LTCV-1 belong to the same novel species, putatively named Piscichuvirus testudinae. This study demonstrates the first in situ evidence of chuviral pathogenicity in animals and only the second instance of jingchuviral isolation. The association of these chuviruses in three different chelonians with neurologic disease suggests the possibility that chuviruses are a significant, previously unrecognized cause of lymphocytic meningoencephalomyelitis in freshwater and marine turtles. Additional studies of these viruses are needed to elucidate their role in chelonians and the possibility of related viruses in other related hosts.

ImportanceChuviruses have been identified in multiple animal species, including humans. However, most were identified metagenomically, and detection was not strongly associated with disease. This study provides the first evidence of chuviral disease in animals in diseased tissue: mononuclear meningoencephalomyelitis in three chelonians from three different genera, two distinct families. These pathogenic turtle chuviruses belong to the genus Piscichuvirus containing other non-mammalian vertebrate chuviruses and were classified together within a novel chuviral species. This study supports the need for further investigations into chuviruses to understand their biology, pathogenic potential, and their association with central nervous system inflammation in chelonians, other reptiles, and other vertebrates.",James B Stanton,University of Georgia

It was first identified in 1976 during two outbreaks of fatal haemorrhagic fever in Central Africa. Due to its high fatality rate and lack of a widespread cure, Ebola HF poses a considerable challenge in treatment, making Ebola virus disease (EVD) one of the deadliest zoonotic diseases. The viral genome is [~]19kb long, linear, non-segmented, and negative single-stranded (-SS) RNA. The genome of the Ebola virus (EBOV) comprises seven genes, namely NP, GP, L, and VP (VP30, VP24, VP40, VP35), which encode nucleoprotein, glycoprotein, RNA polymerase, and viral proteins. By optimizing the DNA sequence through codon adaptation, we observed significant enhancements in the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the GC content compared to the wild-type strain. These findings demonstrate that optimized genes hold the potential for improved expression in the host organism without the production of truncated proteins. Further, these optimized genes can facilitate proper protein folding and function. In conclusion, these results have implications for vaccine production, as higher codon optimization enhances the expression of the genes, making them appropriate amounts for vaccine development.",Indra Mani,"Gargi College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"

D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.",pharmacology and toxicology,2023-09-26,2024-01-03,"Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

J.; Gausepohl, A. M.; Seneviratne, H. K.; Bumpus, N. N.; Williams, D. W.",pathology,2022-09-27,2024-01-30,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to promote neurocognitive impairment, mood disorders, and brain atrophy even in the modern era of viral suppression. Brain lipids are vulnerable to HIV-associated energetic strain and contribute to HIV-associated neurologic dysfunction due to alterations in lipid breakdown and structural lipid composition. HIV neuropathology is region dependent, yet there has not been comprehensive characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of brain lipids during infection that may impact neurologic function. To address this gap, we evaluated the spatial lipid distribution using matrix laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) across four brain regions (parietal cortex, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal cortex), as well as kidney for a peripheral tissue control, in a virally suppressed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque. We assessed lipids indicative of fat breakdown [acylcarnitines (CARs)] and critical structural lipids [phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs)] across fatty acid chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation. CARs with very long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were more abundant across all brain regions than shorter chain, saturated or monounsaturated species. We observed distinct brain lipid distribution patterns for CARs and PCs. However, no clear expression patterns emerged for PEs. Surprisingly, kidney was nearly devoid of ions corresponding to PUFAs common in brain. PEs and PCs with PUFAs had little intensity and less density than other species and, only one CAR species was observed in kidney at high intensity. Overall, our study provides substantial evidence for persistent bioenergetic changes to the brain despite viral suppression, including region-dependent mobilization of CARs for oxidation and disparities in the presence of key phospholipids necessary for maintaining proper brain structure and function. These data indicate that region-specific interventions to restore proper lipid metabolism are essential for treating HIV neurologic disease in the era of antiretroviral therapy.

F.",biophysics,2023-05-04,2024-01-22,"Intrinsically disordered proteins are highly dynamic biomolecules that rapidly interconvert between many structural conformations. Traditionally, these proteins have been considered un-druggable because of their lack of classical long-lived binding pockets. Recent evidence suggests that intrinsically disordered proteins can bind small, drug-like molecules, however, there are limited approaches to characterize these interactions experimentally. Here we demonstrate that ligand-detected 19F transverse relaxation rates (R2) obtained from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy are highly sensitive to the interaction between a small-molecule and an intrinsically disordered protein, in contrast to chemical shift perturbations which are minimally sensitive for this interaction. With this method, we show that the small molecule, 5-fluoroindole, interacts with the disordered domains of non-structural protein 5A from hepatitis C virus with a Kd of 260 {+/-} 110 M. We also demonstrate that 5-fluoroindole remains highly dynamic in the bound form. Our findings suggest that ligand-detected 19F transverse relaxation measurements could represent a highly effective screening strategy to identify molecules capable of interacting with these traditionally elusive, dynamic biomolecules.",D.
