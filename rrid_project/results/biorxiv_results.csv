CrAssphages are not only the most abundant viruses but also are a common component of the gut phageome across human populations. However, the role of crAssphages in obesity (O) and obesity with metabolic syndrome (OMS) remains largely unknown. Therefore, we explored the role that crAssphages have on both diseases in a childrens cohort. We found decreased crAssphage abundance, prevalence, richness, and diversity in O and OMS compared to normal-weight (NW), suggesting a loss of crAssphages stability in the human phageome associated with the disease. Interestingly, when we analyzed the abundance of host crAssphages bacteria, we found that Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidia, and Bacteroidales were significantly decreased in O and OMS, suggesting a possible relation with the loss of crAssphages stability. Regarding crAssphage taxonomy, a significantly decreased abundance of the crAssphage Alpha subfamily and the Alpha_1 and Alpha_4 genus and a significant overabundance of the Delta_8 was found in OMS. A strong taxonomical signature of obesity is the over-abundance of Bacilli, which also were significantly increased in O and OMS. Notably, we found a significant negative correlation between crAssphages and Bacilli abundances, suggesting an association between the decreased abundance of crAssphage and the over-abundance of Bacilli in OMS. Furthermore, we found a loss of crAssphage stability in the human virome associated with the presence of obesity, having a more significant impact on obesity with metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these bacteriophages could play an essential role in inhibiting metabolic syndrome in obese individuals. Our results open a promising treatment for these diseases through fecal crAssphage transplantation.",Adrian  Ochoa-Leyva,"Instituto de Biotecnologia, UNAM"

M.",microbiology,2022-01-18,2023-01-09,"Substantial clinical evidence supports the notion that ciliary function in the airways plays an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Although ciliary damage has been observed in both in vitro and in vivo models, consequent impaired mucociliary transport (MCT) remains unknown for the intact MCT apparatus from an in vivo model of disease. Using golden Syrian hamsters, a common animal model that recapitulates human COVID-19, we quantitatively followed the time course of physiological, virological, and pathological changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the deficiency of the MCT apparatus using micro-optical coherence tomography, a novel method to visualize and simultaneously quantitate multiple aspects of the functional microanatomy of intact airways. Corresponding to progressive weight loss up to 7 days post-infection (dpi), viral detection and histopathological analysis in both the trachea and lung revealed steadily descending infection from the upper airways, as the main target of viral invasion, to lower airways and parenchymal lung, which are likely injured through indirect mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a 67% decrease in MCT rate as early as 2 dpi, largely due to diminished motile ciliation coverage, but not airway surface liquid depth, periciliary liquid depth, or cilia beat frequency of residual motile cilia. Further analysis indicated that the fewer motile cilia combined with abnormal ciliary motion of residual cilia contributed to the delayed MCT. The time course of physiological, virological, and pathological progression suggest that functional deficits of the MCT apparatus predispose to COVID-19 pathogenesis by extending viral retention and may be a risk factor for secondary infection. As a consequence, therapies directed towards the MCT apparatus deserve further investigation as a treatment modality.",Steven M Rowe,University of Alabama at Birmingham

The activity of myeloid cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) is essential for correct mobilization of the innate and adaptive responses to a pathogen. Impaired levels and responses of monocytes and DC to SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be a driving force behind the immune dysregulation that characterizes severe COVID-19. Here, we followed, for 6-7 months, a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the early waves of the pandemic. The levels and phenotypes of circulating monocyte and DC subsets were assessed to determine both the early and long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found increased monocyte levels that persisted for 6-7 months, mostly attributed to elevated levels of classical monocytes. While most DC subsets recovered from an initial decrease, we found elevated levels of cDC2/cDC3 at the 6-7 month timepoint. Analysis of functional markers on monocytes and DC revealed sustained reduction in PD-L1 expression but increased CD86 expression across almost all cell types examined. Finally, viral load and CRP correlated to the appearance of circulating antibodies and levels of circulating DC and monocyte subsets, respectively. By elucidating some of the long-term effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection has on these key innate myeloid cells, we have shed more light on how the immune landscape remains affected in the months following severe COVID-19.",Marie Larsson,Linkoping University

R.; Katzourakis, A.",microbiology,2022-10-04,2023-01-04,"Pangolins are scaly and toothless mammals which are distributed across Africa and Asia. Currently, the Malayan, Chinese and Philippine pangolins are all designated as critically-endangered species. Although few pangolin viruses have been described, their viromes have received more attention following the discovery that they harbour sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2. Using a large-scale genome mining strategy, we discovered novel lineages of papillomaviruses infecting the Malayan and Chinese pangolins. We were able to assemble 3 complete circular papillomavirus genomes with an intact coding capacity, and 5 additional L1 genes encoding the major capsid protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 7 out of 8 L1 sequences formed a monophyletic group which is the sister lineage to the Tree shrew papillomavirus 1, isolated from Yunnan province in China. Additionally, a single L1 sequence assembled from a Chinese pangolin was placed in a clade closer to alpha- and omegapapillomaviruses. Examination of the SRA data from 95 re-sequenced genomes revealed that 49.3% Malayan pangolins and 50% Chinese pangolins, were positive for papillomavirus reads. Our results indicate that pangolins in South East Asia are the hosts to diverse and highly prevalent papillomaviruses, which may have implications for pangolin health and conservation.",Aris Katzourakis,University of Oxford

Biosurveillance of these pathogens is a high priority to prevent epidemics on maize in the US and consequent damage to the US economy. The unresolved taxonomy and dearth of molecular resources for Peronosclerospora spp. hinder these efforts. P. sorghi is a pathogen of sorghum and maize with a global distribution, for which limited diversity has been detected in the southern USA. We characterized the genome, transcriptome, and mitogenome of an isolate, representing the US pathotype 6. The highly homozygous genome was assembled using 10x Genomics linked reads and scaffolded using Hi-C into 13 chromosomes. The total assembled length was 319.6 Mb--larger than any other oomycete previously assembled. The mitogenome was 38 kb, similar in size to other oomycetes, although it had a unique gene order. Nearly 20,000 genes were annotated in the nuclear genome, more than described for other downy mildew causing oomycetes. The 13 chromosomes of P. sorghi were highly syntenic with the 17 chromosomes of Peronospora effusa with conserved centromeric regions and distinct chromosomal fusions. The increased assembly size and gene count of P. sorghi is due to extensive retrotransposition, resulting in putative pseudogenization. Ancestral genes had higher transcript abundance and were enriched for differential expression. This study provides foundational resources for analysis of Peronosclerospora and comparisons to other oomycete genera. Further genomic studies of global Peronosclerospora spp. will determine the suitability of the mitogenome, ancestral genes, and putative pseudogenes for marker development and taxonomic relationships.",Richard Michelmore,"University of California, Davis"

K.; Bharadwaj, C.; Chongtham, C.; Bais, S. S.; Medigeshi, G. R.; Arimbasseri, G. A.; Basak, S.",immunology,2021-11-02,2023-01-03,"Besides its functions in the skeletomuscular system, vitamin D also promotes protective immunity against viral pathogens. Viral sensing by mammalian cells triggers nuclear activation of RelA/NF-{kappa}B and IRF3 factors, which collaborate in mediating the early induction of antiviral type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). Autocrine T1-IFN signaling further accumulates otherwise negligibly expressed IRF7 in virus-infected cells that then sustains T1-IFN production in a positive feedback. Surprisingly, prior cell-culture studies revealed that vitamin D actually suppresses signal-induced RelA activation. Indeed, it remains unclear how vitamin D limits viral multiplication in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we examined the role of vitamin D in controlling cellular infections by the Chandipura virus (CHPV), a cytoplasmic RNA virus implicated in human epidemics. We found that vitamin D conditioning produced an altered cell state less permissive for CHPV multiplication because of the heightened expression of T1-IFNs. It is thought that viruses also induce a distinct RelB/NF-{kappa}B activity, which counteracts RelA-driven T1-IFN expressions in infected cells. Our analyses instead characterized a basal nuclear RelB activity, which was downregulated upon vitamin D-mediated suppression of RelB synthesis. Interestingly, this vitamin D-RelB pathway provoked IRF7-mediated positive autoregulation augmenting constitutive T1-IFN expressions even in the absence of viral infections. Accordingly, RelB deficiency rendered redundant, while IRF7 depletion abrogated antiviral vitamin D actions. In sum, our study suggests that the homeostatic state of the signaling circuitry comprising of the NF-{kappa}B and T1-IFN pathways connects micronutrients to antiviral immunity at the cellular level.

Significance statementVitamin D limits viral infections, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Linking micronutrients to antiviral immunity, Ratra et al. characterize an immune signaling circuitry engaged by vitamin D that generates a cellular state less permissive to infections by Chandipura virus, a pathogen of public health importance.",Soumen  Basak,National Institute of Immunology

E.; Mousa, J.",immunology,2022-04-26,2023-01-03,"Streptococcus pneumoniae persists as a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia despite the widespread use of polysaccharide-based vaccines. The limited serotype coverage of current vaccines has led to increased incidence of non-vaccine serotypes, as well as an increase in antibiotic resistance among these serotypes. Pneumococcal infection often follows a primary viral infection such as influenza virus, which hinders host defense and results in bacterial spread to the lungs. We previously isolated human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the conserved surface antigen pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (PhtD), and we demonstrated that mAbs to this antigen are protective against lethal pneumococcal challenge prophylactically and therapeutically. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism of protection of a protective anti- pneumococcal human mAb, PhtD3, which is mediated by the presence of complement and macrophages in a mouse model of pneumococcal infection. Treatment with mAb PhtD3 reduced blood and lung bacterial burden in mice, and mAb PhtD3 is able to bind to bacteria in the presence of the capsular polysaccharide, indicating exposure of surface PhtD on encapsulated bacteria. In a mouse model of secondary pneumococcal infection, protection mediated by mAb PhtD3 and another mAb targeting a different epitope, PhtD7, was reduced, however, robust protection was restored by combining mAb PhtD3 with mAb PhtD7, indicating a synergistic effect. Overall, these studies provide new insights into anti-pneumococcal mAb protection and demonstrate for the first time that mAbs to pneumococcal surface proteins can protect against secondary pneumococcal infection in the mouse model.

Author SummaryThe persistence of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia despite numerous approved pneumococcal vaccines is a serious threat to public health globally. Currently, prophylactic and therapeutic options for Streptococcus pneumoniae are constrained by the limited serotype coverage of vaccines and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. An additional hurdle to overcome is the incidence of secondary pneumococcal infection following a viral infection, which leads to increased mortality. Here, we determined the mechanism of action of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets Streptococcus pneumoniae. We found that mAb PhtD3 operates through macrophage and complement mediated functions. mAb PhtD3 was also discovered to reduce bacterial titers in the lungs and blood and bind to a related antigen PhtE. We also tested additional mAbs and discovered that two unique mAbs to the antigen PhtD conferred protection in a pneumococcal-influenza virus co-infection model. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of mAbs targeting conserved proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Jarrod  Mousa,University of Georgia

Here we used K18-hACE2 mice and primary human airway cultures to examine the viral fitness and antigenic relationship among Omicron sublineages. In both K18-hACE2 mice and human airway cultures, Omicron sublineages exhibited a replication order of BA.5 [&ge;] BA.2 [&ge;] BA.2.12.1 > BA.1; no difference in body weight loss was observed among different sublineage-infected mice. The BA.1-, BA.2-, BA.2.12.1-, and BA.5-infected mice developed distinguisable cross-neutralizations against Omicron sublineages, but exhibited little neutralizations against the index virus (i.e., USA-WA1/2020) or the Delta variant. Surprisingly, the BA.5-infected mice developed higher neutralization activity against heterologous BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 than that against homologous BA.5; serum neutralizing titers did not always correlate with viral replication levels in infected animals.
