https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qjcwn,2024-03-13,Goal-directed behaviour is associated with decreased temporal discounting,To be fetched,"Reinforcement learning models are broadly classified as model-based algorithms, which use an internal model of the environment to plan and carry out goal-directed behaviour, or model-free algorithms, which lack such a model and behave in a more habitual manner. Humans differ in the extent to which their decision making resembles that of model-based or model-free algorithms; the degree of this resemblance is related to individual differences in compulsivity, and is also argued to be related to the ability to imagine and make decisions about the future. Here, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit more model-based decision making tend to more frequently choose larger rewards later over smaller rewards sooner in an intertemporal choice task. However, surprisingly, model-free decision making was correlated with the specificity of personal future event narratives in an episodic future thinking task. Participants who provided more specific narratives had slower response times across all tasks, and may therefore have been more affected by time pressure in the reinforcement learning task, resulting in increased model-free decision making. We comment on the role of time pressure in behavioural tasks of the type used here. Future self-continuity, a construct conceptually related to imagining and making decisions about the future, was not found to be related to temporal discounting, model-based or model-free decision making, or episodic future thinking."

This complicates, but  does not negate, their observation that this comparison “does not support the claims that GR is necessary in order to prevent suicide.”"

Here, we explore the possibility that learning fluctuates rhythmically several times per second, with fortuitously timed experiences being more memorable. Although such fleeting opportunities for encoding would evade our awareness, they are predicted by a prominent model describing how theta rhythms in the brain coordinate memory – the SPEAR (Separate Phases for Encoding and Retrieval) model. In a pre-registered study, we adapted a dense sampling approach to reconstruct the time-course of how well 125 people formed memories across milliseconds. We found that memory formation fluctuated at a theta rhythm (3-10 Hz), that these rhythms were not a byproduct of rhythmic attention, and that—like theta rhythms in the brain—memory rhythms were modulated by putative markers of acetylcholine. Critically, our findings provide behavioral evidence for the SPEAR model and reveal the finest timescale at which experience is carved up into memories."

Game theory offers a robust foundation for this understanding, based on the idea that individuals aim to maximize a utility function. However, the exact factors influencing strategy choices remain elusive. While traditional models try to explain human behaviour as a function of the outcomes of available actions, recent experimental research reveals that linguistic content significantly impacts decision-making, thus prompting a paradigm shift from outcome-based to language-based utility functions. This shift is more urgent than ever, given the advancement of generative AI, which has the potential to support humans in making critical decisions through language-based interactions. We propose sentiment analysis as a fundamental tool for this shift and take an initial step by analyzing 61 experimental instructions from the dictator game, an economic game capturing the balance between self-interest and the interest of others, which is at the core of many social interactions. Our meta-analysis shows that sentiment analysis can explain human behaviour beyond economic outcomes. We discuss future research directions. We hope this work sets the stage for a novel game theoretical approach that emphasizes the importance of language in human decisions."

Discharge from early psychosis intervention is a critical stage of treatment that may occur for a variety of reasons. This study characterizes reasons for discharge among participants in early psychosis intervention programs participating in the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) which comprises &gt;100 programs organized under eight academic hubs.   Study Design. We analyzed 1,787 discharges with a focus on program completion, unilateral termination by the client/family, and lost contact with the client/family.  We performed exploratory analyses of demographic, clinical, and functional predictors of discharge reason. Variables predictive of discharge type were included in multilevel logistic regressions, allowing for estimation of predictors of discharge reason and variability in rates by program and hub.  Study Results. An estimated 20-30% of enrolled patients completed the program. Program completion rates were higher among participants who were older on admission, had lower negative symptoms severity, spent more time in education, employment or training, and were covered by private insurance (a close proxy for socioeconomic status). Programs were more likely to lose contact with male participants, black participants, and participants who were never covered by private insurance. After accounting for patient-level factors, there was substantial program-level variation on all three discharge outcomes, and hub-level variability on the proportion of participants who completed the program. The impact of race on program completion varied substantially by program.  Conclusions. Participants discharged from early psychosis intervention services for diverse reasons, some of which were associated with sociocultural factors. Disengagement is a widespread problem affecting all hubs."

Given this, it is essential to examine how these factors are related to biomarkers of addiction.  The current study examined cross-cultural differences in cannabis attitudes, cannabis cue-reactivity in the brain and its associations with cannabis use measures and cannabis attitudes in 54 cannabis users in the Netherlands (NL-CUD) and 51 cannabis users in Texas, USA compared to non-using controls (N=50, NL-CON; N=33, TX-CON). Methods: Using a tactile cue-reactivity paradigm in a 3T MRI scanner, cannabis cue-reactivity was isolated in the brain.  Results: While the CUD group overall was more positive and less negative about cannabis and reported higher craving, the TX-CUD group reported significantly more positive and less negative attitudes and less craving than the NL-CUD group. Cannabis cue-reactivity was observed in the CUD group in clusters including the precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, frontal medial cortex, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus. In the TX-CUD group, a positive association was observed between symptom severity and cue-induced craving and cannabis cue-reactivity in precuneus and occipital cortex clusters, while a negative association was observed in the NL-CUD group. In these clusters, individuals with more positive attitudes exhibited a positive association between craving and cue-reactivity and those with less positive attitudes exhibited a negative association. No associations with quantity of use were observed. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of diverging relationships between cannabis cue-reactivity in the brain and cue-induced craving across distinct cannabis use environments."

This may indicate a role for the sensory/neural processing of syllable stress patterns in the aetiology of DLD. Here we explore this connection by investigating the accuracy of the production of multisyllabic words from a speech rhythm/syllable stress perspective. Method: We adapted a computerized speech copying task originally designed for children with dyslexia, in which participants copy aloud familiar targets like “alligator”. Fifty-seven children with and without DLD were tested with a 30-item battery comprising equal numbers of 2-syllable, 3-syllable and 4-syllable words. The children with DLD (N=20) were compared with both age-matched typically-developing control children (AMC, N=21) and younger typically-developing control children with less mature language skills (younger language controls, YLC, N=16). Similarity of the child’s productions to the target in terms of the speech amplitude envelope (AE) and pitch contour was computed using two similarity metrics, correlation and mutual information. Both the speech AE and the pitch contour contain important information about stress patterns and intonational information. Results: Children with DLD were significantly less accurate than AMC at copying the multi-syllabic targets, for both the AE and the pitch contour. The opportunity to repeat the targets had no impact on performance, for any group. Word length effects were similar across groups.  Conclusion: The spoken production of multisyllabic words by children with DLD is atypical regarding both the AE and the pitch contour. This is consistent with a theoretical explanation of DLD based on impaired sensory/neural processing of speech rhythm."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/b64rk,2024-03-13,Visualization Process of Perceptual Features in  Language Comprehension: A Bidirectional  Comparison of Chinese-English and English- Chinese Bilinguals,To be fetched,"Comprehending words, through the theoretical perspectives of mental simulation, is thought to entail the visualization process in which human minds employ visual perceptual features to simulate individual perceptual experiences. This visualization process theoretically extracts and combines multiple perceptual features simultaneously into a simulated entity. However, experimental studies to date support only single-feature visualization processes. Thus, there exists a theoretical gap how human minds visualize words representing multiple perceptual features. Bocanegra et al. (2022) adapted the dual-feature visualization task from Potter and Faulconer (1979) that focused on color and shape as perceptual features only, to test the hypothesis of feature conjunction. This hypothesis predicted a dual-feature benefit - dual-feature word cues facilitated responses to visual targets compared to single-feature word cues - but this response benefit was only replicable under conditions of sequential presentation. Bocanegra et al. concluded that the visualization process is inherently a serial feature conjunction process. However, our pilot study using Chinese word cues detected a dual-feature advantage even under simultaneous presentation. Given that compound words constitute over 70% of Chinese lexical knowledge, it is plausible to hypothesize that comprehending Chinese words involves an immediate feature conjunction process during visualization. With a balanced evaluation of visualization processes between Chinese and English, we will enroll English-Chinese and Chinese-English bilinguals to administer Chinese and English visualization tasks in random sequence. If English and Chinese hinge on distinct feature conjunction processes, it can be predicted that the lexical knowledge of a language determines the conditions under which dual-feature benefits can be detected."

We present a theoretical framework synthesizing cross-field research on JMM within four components. The framework is centered upon interpersonal coordination, a crucial requirement for JMM. The other components imply the influence of individuals’ (past) experience, (current) social traits, and (future) goals on real-time coordination. Our work aims to promote the development of JMM research by organizing existing work, inspiring new questions, and fostering comparability with other research communities."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/dg874,2024-03-13,Extracurricular activities as a way to foster development for youth living in an extreme context: a basic psychological needs perspective in Madagascar,To be fetched,"Numerous studies have highlighted the links between involvement in extracurricular activities and positive outcomes for youth. Nevertheless, studies documenting those links have been conducted primarily in the global North. Little is known about the effect of participating in extracurricular activities for youth developing in extreme contexts (i.e. extreme poverty, refugee camps, conflicted areas, areas affected by climate changes, sexual exploitation or child soldiers). This research is testing if the participation in extracurricular activities of youth (N=96; Mage= 15.07) developing in an extreme context had an effect over time on their psychological well-being as well as the satisfaction and frustration of their basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness). Youth were recruited through a partnership with a local NGO in southern Madagascar, which offers art and sports activities. A control group was recruited in a neighboring public school. Participants had never participated in NGO’s extracurricular activities before entering the study. Four data collection sessions were carried out over a span of 16 months. 96 participants engaged throughout the four data collection sessions. Mixed factorial Analyses of Variance were employed to test the objective. Results show that participation in extracurricular activities for youth developing in an extreme context had positive effects on the satisfaction of the need for autonomy (p=.037) and on the frustration of the basic psychological needs overall (p=.019). Also, the study results show that there was a protective effect of participating in extracurricular activities against the decrease of the needs' satisfaction as this reduction was observed in the control group (p=.038) and not in the youth involved in extracurricular activities. Participation in art, music and sport extracurricular activities seems to have positive outcomes for youth living in an extreme context of development."

Participants were asked to report if they were sceptical about each story and the reasons why they were sceptical (or not). They also completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (OLIFE-B) measuring schizotypy and the Pseudo-profound bullshit scale (PPBS), measuring the endorsement of statements that sound profound but are meaningless. In our preregistered analysis, we found no evidence to suggest that the OLIFE-B or PPBS predict variance in decisions about scepticism. We did find evidence that high scorers on the Unusual Experiences subscale of the OLIFE-B and scores on the PPBS predicted a willingness to change behaviour in response to the stories presented. In the open responses low scores in Unusual Experiences predicted a theme of needing more information before judging scepticism. Our findings highlighted the diverse ways in which participants express scepticism or not and future work should consider how reasoning offers insight to scepticism forming processes."

Moreover, less studies examine the participation in such programs for those developing in extreme conditions (i.e. extreme poverty, sexual exploitation, refugee camps, conflicted areas, areas affected by climate changes). This study focuses on the experience of youth living in the difficult context of Southern Madagascar. The aims of this study are to explore and gain a better understanding of the experience of adolescents engaging in extracurricular activities within this extreme context. A total of 14 (N=14) semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 participants (M=7; F=7), aged 15 to 19 years old, involved in extracurricular programs like art, music and sport, provided by a local non-governmental organisation.

It is crucial to examine how youth optimal development can be sustained in these extreme contexts. Extracurricular activities are considered a potential avenue, yet there is limited research on their impact, especially concerning long-term effects in adulthood. This collaborative study aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the long-term perspectives of young adults who engaged in extracurricular activities (specifically art-music and sports) during adolescence in the challenging southern region of Madagascar. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants (M=4; F=4), aged 19 to 27. The results indicate the value of these programs during their involvement, supporting basic psychological needs, acting as a protective factor against risky behaviors, providing a meaningful time investment, offering a nurturing environment for developing personal values, fostering personal growth, and focusing on education. Importantly, the programs appear to have a lasting impact, influencing participants' adult lives. They contribute to the development of enduring relationships, promote the acquisition of transferable cognitive and non-cognitive skills, facilitate the pursuit of new personal projects, and open doors to employment opportunities. Overall, the findings offer valuable insights into the significance of participating in extracurricular programs for youth in extreme contexts of development, both during and years after their involvement. Results underscore extracurricular programs as a valuable means to sustain optimal youth development over time, emphasizing their importance in challenging environments."

Little is known about the effect of participating in extracurricular activities for youth developing in extreme contexts (i.e. extreme poverty, refugee camps, conflicted areas, areas affected by climate changes, sexual exploitation or child soldiers). This research is testing if the participation in extracurricular activities of youth (N=96; Mage= 15.07) developing in an extreme context had an effect over time on their psychological well-being as well as the satisfaction and frustration of their basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness). Youth were recruited through a partnership with a local NGO in southern Madagascar, which offers art and sports activities. A control group was recruited in a neighboring public school. Participants had never participated in NGO’s extracurricular activities before entering the study. Four data collection sessions were carried out over a span of 16 months. 96 participants engaged throughout the four data collection sessions. Mixed factorial Analyses of Variance were employed to test the objective. Results show that participation in extracurricular activities for youth developing in an extreme context had positive effects on the satisfaction of the need for autonomy (p=.037) and on the frustration of the basic psychological needs overall (p=.019). Also, the study results show that there was a protective effect of participating in extracurricular activities against the decrease of the needs' satisfaction as this reduction was observed in the control group (p=.038) and not in the youth involved in extracurricular activities.

This visualization process theoretically extracts and combines multiple perceptual features simultaneously into a simulated entity. However, experimental studies to date support only single-feature visualization processes. Thus, there exists a theoretical gap how human minds visualize words representing multiple perceptual features. Bocanegra et al. (2022) adapted the dual-feature visualization task from Potter and Faulconer (1979) that focused on color and shape as perceptual features only, to test the hypothesis of feature conjunction. This hypothesis predicted a dual-feature benefit - dual-feature word cues facilitated responses to visual targets compared to single-feature word cues - but this response benefit was only replicable under conditions of sequential presentation. Bocanegra et al. concluded that the visualization process is inherently a serial feature conjunction process. However, our pilot study using Chinese word cues detected a dual-feature advantage even under simultaneous presentation. Given that compound words constitute over 70% of Chinese lexical knowledge, it is plausible to hypothesize that comprehending Chinese words involves an immediate feature conjunction process during visualization. With a balanced evaluation of visualization processes between Chinese and English, we will enroll English-Chinese and Chinese-English bilinguals to administer Chinese and English visualization tasks in random sequence. If English and Chinese hinge on distinct feature conjunction processes, it can be predicted that the lexical knowledge of a language determines the conditions under which dual-feature benefits can be detected."

Attention-to-dimension theories suggest that, through prolonged exposure to their first language (L1), listeners become biased to attend to acoustic dimensions especially informative in that language. Given that selective attention can modulate cortical tracking of sound, attention-to-dimension accounts would predict that tone language speakers would show greater cortical tracking of pitch in L2 speech, even when it is not task-relevant, as well as an enhanced ability to attend to pitch in both speech and music. Here we test these hypotheses by examining neural sound encoding, dimension-selective attention and cue-weighting strategies in 54 native English and 60 Mandarin Chinese speakers. Our results show that Mandarin speakers, compared to native English speakers, are better at attending to pitch and worse at attending to duration in verbal and non-verbal stimuli; moreover, they place more importance on pitch and less on duration during speech and music categorization. The effects of language background were moderated by musical experience, however, with Mandarin-speaking musicians better able to attend to duration and using duration more as a cue to phrase boundary perception. There was no effect of L1 on cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. Nevertheless, the frequency-following response to stimulus pitch was enhanced in Mandarin speakers, suggesting that speaking a tone language can boost processing of early pitch encoding. These findings suggest that tone language experience does not increase the tendency for pitch to capture attention, regardless of task; instead, tone language speakers may benefit from an enhanced ability to direct attention to pitch when it is task-relevant, without affecting pitch salience."

We collected 632 Japanese participants across different regions in Japan and investigated a factor-structure, internal reliability and construct validity of J-SSDO. Overall, internal reliability of J-SSDO was low, while it was similar to that of the original scale especially in Asian languages. Yet, we found medium-to-large correlations between J-SSDO theoretically relevant variables such as attitudes towards aid to the poor, protecting ethnic/religious minorities, and more women in leadership positions."

Some studies show that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives, while others show the opposite pattern. If Chinese has an object relative advantage, this has important implications for theories of reading comprehension. In order to clarify the facts about Chinese, we carried out a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using 15 published studies; this analysis showed that the posterior probability of a subject relative advantage is approximately 0.77 (mean 16, 95% credible intervals −29 and 61 ms). Because the studies had significant biases, it is possible that they may have confounded the results. Bias modelling is a potentially important tool in such situations because it uses expert opinion to incorporate the biases in the model. As a proof of concept, we first identified biases in five of the fifteen studies, and elicited priors on these using the SHELF framework. Then we fitted a random-effects meta-analysis, including priors on biases. This analysis showed a stronger posterior probability (0.96) of a subject relative advantage compared to the standard random-effects meta-analysis (mean 33, credible intervals −4 and 71)."

Protracted development of regulatory neural circuits underpins adolescent-specific risk increases in socioemotional contexts. Although these trends are likely context-specific, comparatively little is known about adolescent economic risk taking. Even less is known about the role of affect in economic risk, which is critical as affect fluctuates throughout adolescence and adolescence is a time of important future-oriented financial decisions. We tested six psychological determinants of risk preference (age, gender, positive affect, negative affect, anxiety, and indecisiveness) on two economic decision tasks (loss aversion and skewness). Adolescents demonstrated higher positive affect and reduced negativity bias in economic risk preference compared to adults. Positive affect boosted risk preference for all subjects, but adults and adolescents diverged in risk direction pointing to differences in subjective valuation. Anxiety was age invariant whereas indecision was not significant. These results highlight the evolving nature of valence bias and affect, with relevance for economic risk, from adolescence into adulthood. This study contributes to understanding of the development of economic choice, and to broader efforts to improve individual and societal risk-related decisions."

Here, we suggest several contributions to advance research in the field: (1) A new dataset on cued speech annotated for various linguistic features, (2) a new approach to automatically identify gesture identity and gesture onset from raw videos, using cued-speech-specific features, which achieves relatively high performance (AUC-identity&gt;0.95), $Error-onset=93ms$), and (3) additional insights into the relationship between sound and gesture production in cued speech, showing that syllable acoustic onset precedes gesture onset by around 150ms on average and that this time difference is more sensitive to consonant rather than to vowel identity.

Guidelines emphasizes the need for research to tailor psychotherapeutic approaches to the acute phase of this illness. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is highly suitable for establishing a therapeutic alliance wherein the patient’s intrinsic motivation can be strengthened to adhere ther-apy and overcome ambivalence towards treatment. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility and impact of a brief intervention with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Method: This pilot study was conducted as single-centered, randomized control trial (RCT), com-paring a brief intervention with MI and supportive conversations. The sample size included 20 newly admitted inpatients. In both conditions they received two sessions per week. In line with CONSORT guidelines for pilot and feasibility studies, we measured various feasibility outcomes. Additionally, we assessed various clinical outcomes using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline values used as covariates. Results: The recruitment target (N = 24) was achieved at 83% in a reasonable timeframe (8 months), with a retention rate of 87% and completion rate at 71%. Eligibility rate (82 %) was high, while the consent rate (48%) was moderate and dropout rate 13% was low as well as the missing data (0.3%). With regard to the clinical outcomes, a group difference was found for the severity of psychotic symptoms, with an advantage for the MI intervention (b = -12.0, 95% CI: [-18.7, -5.2], p &lt; 0.01), although this must be interpreted with caution in view of the small sample. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a clinical trial with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute inpatient psychiatric facility. MI has also demon-strated potential for greater benefits compared to supportive conversations, particularly in ad-dressing the severity of psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless, to obtain more definitive conclusions regarding efficacy, a larger-scale study is planned based on these promising results."

In response, there is a growing interest in leveraging technology to empower patients with knowledge and skills necessary for effective self-management. This study investigates the effectiveness of two distinct technological interventions aimed at enhancing health literacy and self-management among patients with chronic conditions.The first intervention focuses on improving patient knowledge regarding the rational use of antibiotics through educational videos. Antibiotic resistance is a pressing global health concern exacerbated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Addressing this issue requires not only changes in clinical practices but also informed decision- making by patients. Educational videos have emerged as a promising tool for delivering health information in an accessible and engaging format. This study evaluates the impact of educational videos on patient knowledge and behavior related to antibiotic use, aiming to promote responsible antibiotic stewardship among patients. The second intervention explores the use of a mobile app-assisted self-management educational intervention to enhance asthma control among young patients. Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Despite the availability of effective treatments, achieving optimal asthma control remains a challenge for many patients, particularly young individuals. Mobile apps offer a convenient platform for delivering personalized education, monitoring symptoms, and facilitating communication between patients and healthcare providers. This study assesses the effectiveness of a mobile app- assisted self-management intervention in improving asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire. By evaluating these technological interventions, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of technology in chronic disease management. The findings have implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology developers seeking innovative solutions to enhance patient engagement, health literacy, and self-management skills. Ultimately, the successful integration of technology into  healthcare strategies holds the potential to empower patients, improve treatment adherence, and optimize health outcomes in the context of chronic conditions."

Studies to date showed that participants’ ability to tell the eye-of-origin most likely depends on contextual cues. Nevertheless, it has been shown that exogenous attention can enhance performance for monocularly presented stimuli. We questioned whether adults can be trained to discriminate the eye-of-origin of their perceptions and if this ability depends on the strength of the monocular channels. We used attentional feed-forward training to improve the subject’s eye of origin discrimination performance with voluntary attention. During training, participants received a binocular cue to inform them of the eye of origin of an upcoming target. Using continuous flash suppression, we also measured the signal strength of the monocular targets to see any possible modulations related to the cues. We collected confidence ratings from the participants about their eye-of-origin judgments to study in further detail whether metacognition has access to this information. Our results show that, even though voluntary attention did not alter the strength of the monocular channels, eye-of-origin discrimination performance improved following the training. A similar pattern was observed for confidence. The results from the feedforward attentional training and the increase in subjective confidence point towards a high-level decisional mechanism being responsible for the eye-of-origin judgment. We propose that this high-level process is informed by subtle sensory cues such as the differences in luminance or contrast in the two monocular channels."

However, Asian Americans were featured prominently by the organization Students for Fair Admissions, which played a central role in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action. This may distort people’s estimates of Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action. Two studies (N = 695) found that people, even Asian Americans, underestimated Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action. Three follow-up studies (N = 1,625), where we manipulated perceived Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action or the Supreme Court’s decision, found no evidence that such information affected White people’s support for affirmative action. In Study 6 (N = 365), however, we found that Asian Americans were more likely to agree with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action when they saw that a majority of Asian Americans supported the court ruling (relative to a control condition in which no information was presented). This suggests that the widespread misperception of Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action and their central role in the Supreme Court cases may ultimately create a self-fulfilling prophecy that could shift individual Asian Americans’ own attitude about affirmative action."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9s5gj,2024-03-12,Validating a measure of the precision of ascending noxious signals,To be fetched,"Pain perception can be described as a process of Bayesian inference, which generates sensory estimates based on prior expectations and afferent information. The inference is inherently affected by the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution of centrally-predicted ascending noxious signals. In this study, we examined the measurement validity of Bayesian likelihood precision in pain perception. Using a 2x2 fully factorial within-subject design, we measured and compared the precision of the distribution of centrally-predicted noxious stimuli in four tasks administered to 57 healthy adults: the cued-pain task (CPT) and the Focused Analgesia Test (FAST), in two noxious modalities, thermal and electrical.  A hierarchical Bayesian model was applied to the CPT, and the FAST was employed as a validation criterion, given that it is known to correlate with clinical pain reports and the placebo response. We found that individuals with a more precise representation of ascending sensory signals in the cued-pain task produced less variable pain reports in the FAST. We validated the result by replicating this correlation across thermal and electrical pain. These results support the validity of our approach to the measurement of precision of ascending noxious signals. Their correlation with FAST scores supports their criterion validity and their correlation across noxious sub-modalities support the concurrent validity of this measurement. In the future, the precision of noxious inputs could be used to quantify individual placebo susceptibility, and thereby optimise the assay sensitivity of randomised clinical trials of new pain medication."

Although these trends are likely context-specific, comparatively little is known about adolescent economic risk taking. Even less is known about the role of affect in economic risk, which is critical as affect fluctuates throughout adolescence and adolescence is a time of important future-oriented financial decisions. We tested six psychological determinants of risk preference (age, gender, positive affect, negative affect, anxiety, and indecisiveness) on two economic decision tasks (loss aversion and skewness). Adolescents demonstrated higher positive affect and reduced negativity bias in economic risk preference compared to adults. Positive affect boosted risk preference for all subjects, but adults and adolescents diverged in risk direction pointing to differences in subjective valuation. Anxiety was age invariant whereas indecision was not significant. These results highlight the evolving nature of valence bias and affect, with relevance for economic risk, from adolescence into adulthood. This study contributes to understanding of the development of economic choice, and to broader efforts to improve individual and societal risk-related decisions."

Goh, Nicholas Alt","Polling data show that 69% of Asian American voters favor affirmative action. However, Asian Americans were featured prominently by the organization Students for Fair Admissions, which played a central role in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action. This may distort people’s estimates of Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action. Two studies (N = 695) found that people, even Asian Americans, underestimated Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action. Three follow-up studies (N = 1,625), where we manipulated perceived Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action or the Supreme Court’s decision, found no evidence that such information affected White people’s support for affirmative action. In Study 6 (N = 365), however, we found that Asian Americans were more likely to agree with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action when they saw that a majority of Asian Americans supported the court ruling (relative to a control condition in which no information was presented). This suggests that the widespread misperception of Asian Americans’ support for affirmative action and their central role in the Supreme Court cases may ultimately create a self-fulfilling prophecy that could shift individual Asian Americans’ own attitude about affirmative action."

Sarı, Samuel Recht, Claudia Lunghi","Helmholtz asked whether one could discriminate which eye is the origin of one’s perception merely based on the retinal signals. Studies to date showed that participants’ ability to tell the eye-of-origin most likely depends on contextual cues. Nevertheless, it has been shown that exogenous attention can enhance performance for monocularly presented stimuli. We questioned whether adults can be trained to discriminate the eye-of-origin of their perceptions and if this ability depends on the strength of the monocular channels. We used attentional feed-forward training to improve the subject’s eye of origin discrimination performance with voluntary attention. During training, participants received a binocular cue to inform them of the eye of origin of an upcoming target. Using continuous flash suppression, we also measured the signal strength of the monocular targets to see any possible modulations related to the cues. We collected confidence ratings from the participants about their eye-of-origin judgments to study in further detail whether metacognition has access to this information. Our results show that, even though voluntary attention did not alter the strength of the monocular channels, eye-of-origin discrimination performance improved following the training. A similar pattern was observed for confidence. The results from the feedforward attentional training and the increase in subjective confidence point towards a high-level decisional mechanism being responsible for the eye-of-origin judgment. We propose that this high-level process is informed by subtle sensory cues such as the differences in luminance or contrast in the two monocular channels."

In response, there is a growing interest in leveraging technology to empower patients with knowledge and skills necessary for effective self-management. This study investigates the effectiveness of two distinct technological interventions aimed at enhancing health literacy and self-management among patients with chronic conditions.The first intervention focuses on improving patient knowledge regarding the rational use of antibiotics through educational videos. Antibiotic resistance is a pressing global health concern exacerbated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Addressing this issue requires not only changes in clinical practices but also informed decision- making by patients. Educational videos have emerged as a promising tool for delivering health information in an accessible and engaging format. This study evaluates the impact of educational videos on patient knowledge and behavior related to antibiotic use, aiming to promote responsible antibiotic stewardship among patients. The second intervention explores the use of a mobile app-assisted self-management educational intervention to enhance asthma control among young patients. Asthma is a common chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Despite the availability of effective treatments, achieving optimal asthma control remains a challenge for many patients, particularly young individuals. Mobile apps offer a convenient platform for delivering personalized education, monitoring symptoms, and facilitating communication between patients and healthcare providers. This study assesses the effectiveness of a mobile app- assisted self-management intervention in improving asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire. By evaluating these technological interventions, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of technology in chronic disease management. The findings have implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology developers seeking innovative solutions to enhance patient engagement, health literacy, and self-management skills. Ultimately, the successful integration of technology into  healthcare strategies holds the potential to empower patients, improve treatment adherence, and optimize health outcomes in the context of chronic conditions."

Hand gestures in cued speech convey complementary information to that available from lip-reading alone, which helps to communicate accurate phonological information. Cued speech provides several unique opportunities for scientific research, such as studying phonological processing via the visual modality. However, cued speech has been studied only scarcely since its invention, and there are only a few empirical datasets and standardized methods available to the scientific community. Here, we suggest several contributions to advance research in the field: (1) A new dataset on cued speech annotated for various linguistic features, (2) a new approach to automatically identify gesture identity and gesture onset from raw videos, using cued-speech-specific features, which achieves relatively high performance (AUC-identity&gt;0.95), $Error-onset=93ms$), and (3) additional insights into the relationship between sound and gesture production in cued speech, showing that syllable acoustic onset precedes gesture onset by around 150ms on average and that this time difference is more sensitive to consonant rather than to vowel identity. We make the new dataset and all associated tools publicly available."

The inference is inherently affected by the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution of centrally-predicted ascending noxious signals. In this study, we examined the measurement validity of Bayesian likelihood precision in pain perception. Using a 2x2 fully factorial within-subject design, we measured and compared the precision of the distribution of centrally-predicted noxious stimuli in four tasks administered to 57 healthy adults: the cued-pain task (CPT) and the Focused Analgesia Test (FAST), in two noxious modalities, thermal and electrical.  A hierarchical Bayesian model was applied to the CPT, and the FAST was employed as a validation criterion, given that it is known to correlate with clinical pain reports and the placebo response. We found that individuals with a more precise representation of ascending sensory signals in the cued-pain task produced less variable pain reports in the FAST. We validated the result by replicating this correlation across thermal and electrical pain. These results support the validity of our approach to the measurement of precision of ascending noxious signals. Their correlation with FAST scores supports their criterion validity and their correlation across noxious sub-modalities support the concurrent validity of this measurement. In the future, the precision of noxious inputs could be used to quantify individual placebo susceptibility, and thereby optimise the assay sensitivity of randomised clinical trials of new pain medication."

Guidelines emphasizes the need for research to tailor psychotherapeutic approaches to the acute phase of this illness. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is highly suitable for establishing a therapeutic alliance wherein the patient’s intrinsic motivation can be strengthened to adhere ther-apy and overcome ambivalence towards treatment. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility and impact of a brief intervention with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Method: This pilot study was conducted as single-centered, randomized control trial (RCT), com-paring a brief intervention with MI and supportive conversations. The sample size included 20 newly admitted inpatients. In both conditions they received two sessions per week. In line with CONSORT guidelines for pilot and feasibility studies, we measured various feasibility outcomes. Additionally, we assessed various clinical outcomes using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline values used as covariates. Results: The recruitment target (N = 24) was achieved at 83% in a reasonable timeframe (8 months), with a retention rate of 87% and completion rate at 71%. Eligibility rate (82 %) was high, while the consent rate (48%) was moderate and dropout rate 13% was low as well as the missing data (0.3%). With regard to the clinical outcomes, a group difference was found for the severity of psychotic symptoms, with an advantage for the MI intervention (b = -12.0, 95% CI: [-18.7, -5.2], p &lt; 0.01), although this must be interpreted with caution in view of the small sample. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a clinical trial with MI for patients with psychosis in an acute inpatient psychiatric facility. MI has also demon-strated potential for greater benefits compared to supportive conversations, particularly in ad-dressing the severity of psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless, to obtain more definitive conclusions regarding efficacy, a larger-scale study is planned based on these promising results."

Some studies show that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives, while others show the opposite pattern. If Chinese has an object relative advantage, this has important implications for theories of reading comprehension. In order to clarify the facts about Chinese, we carried out a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using 15 published studies; this analysis showed that the posterior probability of a subject relative advantage is approximately 0.77 (mean 16, 95% credible intervals −29 and 61 ms). Because the studies had significant biases, it is possible that they may have confounded the results. Bias modelling is a potentially important tool in such situations because it uses expert opinion to incorporate the biases in the model. As a proof of concept, we first identified biases in five of the fifteen studies, and elicited priors on these using the SHELF framework. Then we fitted a random-effects meta-analysis, including priors on biases. This analysis showed a stronger posterior probability (0.96) of a subject relative advantage compared to the standard random-effects meta-analysis (mean 33, credible intervals −4 and 71)."

In this research, we developed the Japanese version of the short social dominance orientation scale (J-SSDO). We collected 632 Japanese participants across different regions in Japan and investigated a factor-structure, internal reliability and construct validity of J-SSDO. Overall, internal reliability of J-SSDO was low, while it was similar to that of the original scale especially in Asian languages. Yet, we found medium-to-large correlations between J-SSDO theoretically relevant variables such as attitudes towards aid to the poor, protecting ethnic/religious minorities, and more women in leadership positions."

Attention-to-dimension theories suggest that, through prolonged exposure to their first language (L1), listeners become biased to attend to acoustic dimensions especially informative in that language. Given that selective attention can modulate cortical tracking of sound, attention-to-dimension accounts would predict that tone language speakers would show greater cortical tracking of pitch in L2 speech, even when it is not task-relevant, as well as an enhanced ability to attend to pitch in both speech and music. Here we test these hypotheses by examining neural sound encoding, dimension-selective attention and cue-weighting strategies in 54 native English and 60 Mandarin Chinese speakers. Our results show that Mandarin speakers, compared to native English speakers, are better at attending to pitch and worse at attending to duration in verbal and non-verbal stimuli; moreover, they place more importance on pitch and less on duration during speech and music categorization. The effects of language background were moderated by musical experience, however, with Mandarin-speaking musicians better able to attend to duration and using duration more as a cue to phrase boundary perception. There was no effect of L1 on cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. Nevertheless, the frequency-following response to stimulus pitch was enhanced in Mandarin speakers, suggesting that speaking a tone language can boost processing of early pitch encoding. These findings suggest that tone language experience does not increase the tendency for pitch to capture attention, regardless of task; instead, tone language speakers may benefit from an enhanced ability to direct attention to pitch when it is task-relevant, without affecting pitch salience."

Over 20% of the population suffer from long-term pain. Unfortunately, there are no clinical tests that predicts who will develop long-term pain. The overall aim is to predict future pain incidence based on brain function, pain behavior, health status, and genetic variability. Method PrePain utilizes a superstruct design, which involves recruiting participants from ongoing research projects. Eligible individuals for participation in PrePain were over 18 years old and free from long-term pain. During the baseline visit, participants provide pain and health-related questionnaires, undergo structural and functional MRI scans, and provide a saliva sample for DNA extraction. Individual baseline measures are then routinely followed- up via national registries. Result We present quality-assessed data from over 300 participants. The average age was 34 years, and most participants were women (75%). Participants rated their pain sensitivity above average and reported low avoidance. Catastrophizing thoughts during painful episodes were rated as moderate. Assessments of (f)MRI data indicated generally good image quality. In this first follow-up, we found that 45 participants had a pain-related diagnoses. Conclusion Results indicate that a superstruct design is feasible for collecting a large number of high-quality data. The incidence of long-term pain indicates that a sufficient number of participants have been recruited to complete the prediction analyses. PrePain is a unique prospective pain database with a fair prognosis to determine risk factors of long-term pain."

We began tracking the impacts of this pandemic for 633 first-year college students from four US universities (M age = 18.8 years) in Spring 2020 and followed students to Spring 2023. Students provided narratives about the impacts of COVID and reports of mental health concerns, identity development, well-being. Students reported concerns for mental health, identity, and well-being during the first year of COVID impacts. The return to in-person activities predicted broad increases in narrative growth and concomitant decreases in COVID stressors, increases in identity exploration and commitment and increases in psychological and academic well-being. Changes in COVID stressors and narrative growth served as mediators between the return to in-person activities around campus and student outcomes.

In six pre-registered studies with US samples from Prolific (N = 5,095), we employed an intergenerational probability discounting task, discovering people discount the value of life as uncertainty and intergenerational distance from the present increase. Specifically, as uncertainty about impacting the future rises, individuals increasingly prioritize saving fewer present lives over more future lives, particularly for more distant future beneficiaries (Studies 1-2). Experimental evidence (Studies 3-4) suggests that certainty perceptions drive intergenerational concern, rather than the reverse. Drawing upon seminal research from cognitive science and behavioral economics, these findings address gaps in emerging social psychological inquiry into long-term intergenerational concern, reconcile debates on the ethical philosophy of longtermism, and offer practical implications for decision-makers in public policy, emphasizing the need to balance hypothetical threats to society’s future with its present-day needs."

Evidence review: We searched 8 databases and conducted manual scoping to identify peer reviewed quantitative studies published up to November 2023. Objective patient safety outcomes of any type were eligible. The findings were analysed descriptively and discussed in  a narrative synthesis. Findings: Nine papers were selected for inclusion which reported on heterogeneous patient safety outcomes. Five studies showed a significant relationship between psychological safety and patient safety. The majority of studies reported on the experiences of nurses working in healthcare from the USA.  Conclusion: No clear conclusions can be extracted regarding the relationship between psychological safety and patient safety. Patient safety may be contradictory to elements of psychological safety and a more nuanced approach is needed.  Systematic review registration This systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD4202347829)."

In six pre-registered studies with US samples from Prolific (N = 5,095), we employed an intergenerational probability discounting task, discovering people discount the value of life as uncertainty and intergenerational distance from the present increase. Specifically, as uncertainty about impacting the future rises, individuals increasingly prioritize saving fewer present lives over more future lives, particularly for more distant future beneficiaries (Studies 1-2). Experimental evidence (Studies 3-4) suggests that certainty perceptions drive intergenerational concern, rather than the reverse. Drawing upon seminal research from cognitive science and behavioral economics, these findings address gaps in emerging social psychological inquiry into long-term intergenerational concern, reconcile debates on the ethical philosophy of longtermism, and offer practical implications for decision-makers in public policy, emphasizing the need to balance hypothetical threats to society’s future with its present-day needs."

Farmer, Adam Lockwood, Anisa Goforth, Christopher Thomas","This project explores the rapidly evolving integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into psychological practice, focusing on health service psychologists. The study critically examines the potential, limitations, and ethical/legal considerations of AI use in this field.  Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), presents both promising applications and significant ethical concerns for psychological practice. This paper aims to provide a balanced view of AI's integration into psychology, advocating for careful oversight, ethical practices, and legal compliance to harness AI's potential responsibly. The manuscript details AI's practical uses in administrative tasks, therapeutic services, and enhancing service provision, while also addressing the potential risks such as bias introduction, deskilling, and privacy concerns. Special attention is given to the ethical and legal challenges posed by AI technologies, emphasizing the need for ongoing evaluation and updating of ethical codes and legal frameworks to align with technological advancements. This project raises awareness among psychologists about the complexities of AI application in their practice, urging a cautious yet optimistic approach to integrating these technologies. It serves as a call to action for the psychological community to actively engage in shaping the future of AI in their field, ensuring that advancements improve service quality without compromising ethical standards or client welfare."

McLean, Cecilia Wainryb, Monisha Pasupathi","The COVID-19 pandemic has defined the college career for this generation of learners, threatening mental health, identity development, and college functioning. We began tracking the impacts of this pandemic for 633 first-year college students from four US universities (M age = 18.8 years) in Spring 2020 and followed students to Spring 2023. Students provided narratives about the impacts of COVID and reports of mental health concerns, identity development, well-being. Students reported concerns for mental health, identity, and well-being during the first year of COVID impacts. The return to in-person activities predicted broad increases in narrative growth and concomitant decreases in COVID stressors, increases in identity exploration and commitment and increases in psychological and academic well-being. Changes in COVID stressors and narrative growth served as mediators between the return to in-person activities around campus and student outcomes. Findings expand insights of development and mental health across much of this generation-defining event."

Over 20% of the population suffer from long-term pain. Unfortunately, there are no clinical tests that predicts who will develop long-term pain. The overall aim is to predict future pain incidence based on brain function, pain behavior, health status, and genetic variability. Method PrePain utilizes a superstruct design, which involves recruiting participants from ongoing research projects. Eligible individuals for participation in PrePain were over 18 years old and free from long-term pain. During the baseline visit, participants provide pain and health-related questionnaires, undergo structural and functional MRI scans, and provide a saliva sample for DNA extraction. Individual baseline measures are then routinely followed- up via national registries. Result We present quality-assessed data from over 300 participants. The average age was 34 years, and most participants were women (75%). Participants rated their pain sensitivity above average and reported low avoidance. Catastrophizing thoughts during painful episodes were rated as moderate. Assessments of (f)MRI data indicated generally good image quality. In this first follow-up, we found that 45 participants had a pain-related diagnoses. Conclusion Results indicate that a superstruct design is feasible for collecting a large number of high-quality data. The incidence of long-term pain indicates that a sufficient number of participants have been recruited to complete the prediction analyses. PrePain is a unique prospective pain database with a fair prognosis to determine risk factors of long-term pain."

Previous research suggests no differences between human vs. AI authorship regarding message credibility. However, only a few studies investigated actual AI-written content on complex topics or examined sufficiently large samples. In a between-groups experiment (N = 734), we examined readers’ perceptions of AI authorship of a GPT-written science journalism article. The results of an equivalence test showed that labeling a GPT-written text as AI-written vs. human-written reduced the article’s credibility (d = 0.36). Moreover, AI authorship decreased the source’s perceived credibility (d = 0.24), anthropomorphism (d = 0.67), and intelligence (d = 0.41). Thus, the mere perception of an AI as an author of a text has a small but significant effect on credibility perceptions. The findings are discussed against the backdrop of a growing availability of AI-generated content and a greater awareness of AI authorship."

Whether we find the precursors of these co-speech gestures in infants before they master their native language still remains an open question. Except for deictic gestures, there is little agreement on the existence of iconic, non-referential and symbolic gestures before children start producing their first words. Here, we bridge this knowledge gap by leveraging an ethological method already established for describing speech independent gestures in nonhuman primates, to analyse the spontaneous gestures produced by infants when interacting with their caregivers. We manually annotated video recordings of infant-caregiver interactions (26h) from the CHILDES platform, to describe the gesture forms, types and functions in six infants from 12 to 15 months of age. We describe 62 gesture forms in the pre-speech repertoire. These were categorised into deictic, iconic, non-referential and symbolic gesture types, similar to co-speech gesture types. We also find that the type-function relation of pre-speech gestures map similarly to type-meaning relation of co-speech gestures. Taken together, our results illustrate linguistic properties of infant gestures in the absence of speech, suggesting them to be precursors of co-speech gestures."

Using prospective longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), this preregistered study examined whether socioeconomic disadvantage related differentially to depressive symptoms (n=3012-3530) and cortical and subcortical structures (n=460-733) in emerging adults, depending on the timing of exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage. Family income in early childhood and own income measured concurrently were both significantly related to depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Similar results were observed for perceived financial difficulties. In contrast, only family income in early childhood was associated with brain structure in emerging adulthood, with positive associations with intracranial volume and total and regional cortical surface area. The findings suggest that both objective and subjective aspects of one’s financial standing throughout development relate to depressive symptoms in adulthood, but that specifically early life family income is related to brain structural features in emerging adulthood. This suggests that associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and brain structure originate early in neurodevelopment, highlighting the role of timing of socioeconomic disadvantage."

In the lab, showing substantial learning of such dependencies is challenging. In this study, we explored whether a brief prior exposure of an easy-to-learn long distance dependency structure could facilitate the acquisition of difficult-to-learn multiple non-adjacent dependencies (Experiment 1) and whether the effect is constrained by prior long-term knowledge of such types of dependency (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we found that the subsequent implicit learning of the new multiple non-adjacent dependencies could benefit from brief prior exposure to learnable non-adjacent dependencies compared to Non-Learnable and Unstructured conditions (which have unreliable or neutral prior materials). This facilitative effect was neither cumulative learning over time nor a simple superimposition of the pre-exposure and exposure phases. In Experiment 2, we further found that the brief prior exposure could override biases from long-term experience to improve implicit learning of multiple non-adjacent rules which conflicted with native language experience. The results reported in both studies have been certified as computationally reproducible by an independent statistician. These findings demonstrated that implicitly acquiring multiple non-adjacent dependencies can be facilitated by brief prior exposure to a learnable structure. This powerful facilitative effect can override the constraints provided by long-term experience."

Previous discussions about its evolutionary origins have focused on the possibility that the communication systems of other species show evidence of displacement. Nonetheless, as with other components of human language, tracing the evolutionary history of displacement would benefit from a bottom approach. Accordingly, in this paper, we specifically build on diverse neurobiological findings (but not only) to propose a novel evolutionary itinerary for displacement as found in language. We support the view that changes in selected brain areas (including the hippocampus, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and the parietal cortex), in part resulting from our trend towards a more prosocial behavior (aka human self-domestication), might have potentiated our episodic memory and mental time travel abilities, in turn strengthening displacement in language and cognition."

In the present study, we examined the influence of negative top-down interpretation using an FBI procedure in which a fake body was instructed to be viewed as a negative self-body (“View the virtual body’s back while regarding the virtual body as your own experiencing abdominal pain”). We used skin conductance responses to the fear stimulus presented after the visual-tactile stimuli presentation as the degree of FBI. The results indicated that no difference in skin conductance response was observed between the synchronous and asynchronous presentation of visual-tactile stimuli when the participants were instructed to interpret the virtual body as their own in a negative physical state (Z = -0.877, p = 0.381), and the degree of FBI was smaller than when the participants were instructed to interpret the virtual body top-down as a neutral self-body (Z = 2.159, p = 0.031).

Cross-lagged panel models across three waves indicated no associations of overt discrimination, but participants experiencing more subtle discrimination during their transition to college reported more depressive symptoms after four months. ERI did not function as mediator or moderator. Findings indicate the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of ERI during emerging adulthood."

Twelve right-handed participants performed three motor tasks, two types of reaching movements, and one finger-lifting movement. Reaching movements were performed from the home position to 15 target locations (5 directions and 3 distances), as quickly and precisely as possible, under two conditions: with and without pre-cueing of the target. The finger lifting movement was performed by lifting the index finger (from the home position) upward in the air as quickly as possible. The reaction time (RT), movement time (MT), and temporal kinematics of the index finger were obtained for each condition. In addition, differential RTs (DRT) were induced, implicitly representing the time required for the motor planning process to execute reaching movements. The results showed that the anisotropy of the DRTs was largest in the left-forward direction, suggesting that the temporal costs of the motor planning process depended on the movement direction. For the kinematic analysis, the MT in the left-forward direction was the largest among all directions. In addition, the time from peak velocity to termination of movement (TFPV) was significantly longer in the left-forward direction when the target pre-cueing was not provided than when it was provided. These results suggest that if a reaching movement under no-cue condition is initiated with insufficient time for the motor planning process, especially in the direction requiring large temporal costs, it relies more heavily on the online control process to accomplish the intended performance. It is likely that humans achieve their intended movements by allocating the amount of time before and after movement initiation according to the difficulty of control that varies in relation to the movement direction."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/az9qk,2024-03-11,Integrating Intra- and Interindividual Phenomena in Psychological Theories,To be fetched,"Psychological science is divided into two distinct methodological traditions. One tradition seeks to understand how people function at the individual level, while the other seeks to understand how people differ from each other. Methodologies that have grown out of these traditions typically rely on different sources of data. While both use statistical models to understand the structure of the data, and these models are often similar, Molenaar (2004) showed that results from one type of analysis rarely transfer to the other, unless unrealistic assumptions hold. This raises the question how we may integrate these approaches. In this paper, we argue that formalized theories can be used to connect intra- and interindividual levels of analysis. This connection is indirect, in the sense that the relationship between theory and data is best understood through the intermediate level of phenomena: robust statistical patterns in empirical data. To illustrate this, we introduce a distinction between intra- and interindividual phenomena, and argue that many psychological theories will have implications for both types of phenomena. Formalization provides us with a methodological tool for investigating what kinds of intra- and interindividual phenomena we should expect to find if the theory under consideration were true."

Using causal inference tools for observational studies, we aimed to estimate the total putative causal effects of the most relevant factors for persistent and severe PTSD in Syrian refugee children living in Informal Tented Settlements (ITS) in Lebanon. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of Syrian refugee families living in ITS in Lebanon (BIOPATH study) was analysed. Families with children aged 8-16 years that had left Syria less than 4 years prior to recruitment were included. The first wave was conducted between October 2017 and January 2018. Follow-up data collection was conducted one year later (51.55 +/- 1.84 weeks). A subsample of 134 children was assessed with a structured clinical interview six months after the follow-up (27.02 +/- 7.16 weeks), between December 2018 and August 2019. Of the 2282 families approached in 77 selected settlements, 1600 (70.1%) agreed to participate. After one year, 1438 families were approached and data collected from 1009 families (62.8% re-participation rate). Data from 9 families were excluded during data cleaning. Ninety-eight variables across multiple domains (demographic, psychological, familial and community level) were measured using validated questionnaires and considered for a systematic causal discovery and inference method. Increased risk for severe and persistent PTSD based on symptom score was the primary outcome of interest. This outcome was validated a posteriori through structured clinical interviews in a subsample.  Results: 1591 child-caregiver dyads were included (age = 11.44 +/- 2.44 years, 52.6% female) and 16.2% of children were at classified as at risk for severe and persistent PTSD (DSM-5 confirmed diagnoses in clinical interviews 6 months later 62.5% vs 34.5% in children with lower risk, p&lt;.05; clinical severity score 4.5 vs 3.4, p&lt;.01). In the systematic causal discovery and inference analysis, the level of war exposure (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11 , p&lt;.01), peer violence victimisation (OR: 1.05 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, p&lt;.05), neglect (OR: 1.11 , 95% CI: 1.05-1.17 , p&lt;.01), maltreatment (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.07 , p&lt;.05) and caregiver depression (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.01-1.17 , p&lt;.05) predicted risk for persistent and severe PTSD. The quality of the concurrent refugee environment (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.77, p&lt;.01) was strongly negatively associated with severe and persistent PTSD presentations. Conclusion: Minimising violent re-victimization and exposure to daily stressors, and addressing caregiver mental health, might prevent the development of severe PTSD in refugee children."

However, it has been argued that the WBSI does not measure TS alone, but also unwanted intrusive thoughts (UIT). The current study was conducted in an undergraduate sample from Peru (n = 259). The objectives were (a) to examine the factor structure of the WBSI, (b) to determine if TS and UIT were significant predictors of worry, and (c) to test if worry moderated the association between TS and UIT. A structural equation modelling approach was followed. Results supported a two-factor structure of the WBSI (TS and UIT). Moreover, only UIT but not TS was a significant predictor of worry. Finally, worry did not moderate the link between TS and UIT."

Less attention has been devoted to count responses. A recent growth in interest in count item response models (CIRM)---perhaps sparked by increased occurrence of psychometric count data, e.g., in the form of process data, clinical symptom frequency, number of ideas or errors in cognitive ability assessment---has focused on unidimensional models. A few recently proposed unidimensional CIRMs rely on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution as the conditional response distribution which allows to model conditionally over-, under-, and equidispersed responses. In this article, we generalize one of those CIRMs to the multidimensional case, introducing the Multidimensional Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Model (M2PCMPM) class. Using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop marginal maximum likelihood estimation methods, primarily for exploratory M2PCMPMs. The resulting discrimination matrices are rotationally indeterminate. We pursue the goal of obtaining a simple structure for them by (1) rotating and (2) regularizing the discrimination matrix. Recent IRT research has successfully used regularization of the discrimination matrix to obtain a simple structure (i.e., a sparse solution) for dichotomous and polytomous data. We develop an EM algorithm with lasso ($\ell_1$) regularization for the M2PCMPM and compare (1) and (2) in a simulation study. We illustrate the proposed model with an empirical example using intelligence test data."

Most participants (84.2%) reported at least one form of harassment while running (M = 3.55 types). Gender interacted with sexual orientation such that sexual minority cisgender women reported significantly more lifetime and past-year harassment than straight cisgender women (gs = 0.44–0.45). For fear and behavioral changes, only gender was significant, with cisgender women reporting more fear and behavioral changes than cisgender men (gs = 0.99–1.06). Cisgender women also were more likely than cisgender men to attribute the harassment to gender (ϕ = .70).

Especially children are known for their drive to explore and learn, which is crucial for developing in and navigating through our complex world. Naturally, some children may be more curious than others, leading to differences in how they structure their own learning experiences, subsequently impacting their developmental trajectories. However, there is a gap in the research field for a reliable measure of such differences early in development. Across three studies, we present the development and assessment of the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ), the first caregiver report measure to fill this gap. Items cover observable exploration behaviours in 5- to 24-month-olds to capture general tendencies of their desire to actively explore their immediate surroundings and are evaluated on a 7-point Likert-scale. Exploratory factor analyses and structural equation modelling on a sample of N = 370 UK caregivers led to the final selection of 23 items and provided evidence that the scale is unidimensional enough to allow for an overall curiosity score, whereas three emergent sub-factors of exploration types (sensory, investigative, and social exploration) showed acceptable internal consistency explaining additional variance in the data. Furthermore, the scale had good test-retest reliability after 7 to 14 days (N = 67) and related to the child’s temperament (N = 75; positively with surgency and effortful control, negatively with negative affect) offering evidence of its validity as a trait measure. Together, these results strongly support the scale’s reliability and validity, showcasing the ITCQ as a powerful tool for developmental research."

Methods We analyzed data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child cohort study (MoBa), N=78,307. Mothers reported a lifetime history of depression during the second trimester of pregnancy, and current symptoms of depression during the third trimester using the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist short version (SCL-8). At six months postpartum, mothers self-reported breastfeeding initiation, maintenance, and difficulties.  Results Using binary logistic regression analyses, we report that a lifetime history of depression is associated with a lower likelihood of breastfeeding initiation (OR=0.751, 95%CI=0.650-0.938), breastfeeding maintenance (OR=0.712, 95%CI=0.669-0.785), and a greater likelihood of breastfeeding difficulties (OR=1.86, 95%CI=1.72-2.06). Similarly, prenatal depression was associated with a lower likelihood of breastfeeding initiation (OR=0.904, 95%CI=0.878-0.929), breastfeeding maintenance (OR=0.929, 95%CI=0.920-0.938), and a greater likelihood of breastfeeding difficulties (OR=1.10, 95%CI=1.09-1.12). Results remained largely unchanged when covaried for several confounding variables, including medication use. Conclusion We provide novel evidence that pre-conception and prenatal symptoms of depression are associated with breastfeeding outcomes.

Less attention has been devoted to count responses. A recent growth in interest in count item response models (CIRM)---perhaps sparked by increased occurrence of psychometric count data, e.g., in the form of process data, clinical symptom frequency, number of ideas or errors in cognitive ability assessment---has focused on unidimensional models. A few recently proposed unidimensional CIRMs rely on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution as the conditional response distribution which allows to model conditionally over-, under-, and equidispersed responses. In this article, we generalize one of those CIRMs to the multidimensional case, introducing the Multidimensional Two-Parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Model (M2PCMPM) class. Using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop marginal maximum likelihood estimation methods, primarily for exploratory M2PCMPMs. The resulting discrimination matrices are rotationally indeterminate. We pursue the goal of obtaining a simple structure for them by (1) rotating and (2) regularizing the discrimination matrix. Recent IRT research has successfully used regularization of the discrimination matrix to obtain a simple structure (i.e., a sparse solution) for dichotomous and polytomous data. We develop an EM algorithm with lasso ($\ell_1$) regularization for the M2PCMPM and compare (1) and (2) in a simulation study. We illustrate the proposed model with an empirical example using intelligence test data."

One tradition seeks to understand how people function at the individual level, while the other seeks to understand how people differ from each other. Methodologies that have grown out of these traditions typically rely on different sources of data. While both use statistical models to understand the structure of the data, and these models are often similar, Molenaar (2004) showed that results from one type of analysis rarely transfer to the other, unless unrealistic assumptions hold. This raises the question how we may integrate these approaches. In this paper, we argue that formalized theories can be used to connect intra- and interindividual levels of analysis. This connection is indirect, in the sense that the relationship between theory and data is best understood through the intermediate level of phenomena: robust statistical patterns in empirical data. To illustrate this, we introduce a distinction between intra- and interindividual phenomena, and argue that many psychological theories will have implications for both types of phenomena. Formalization provides us with a methodological tool for investigating what kinds of intra- and interindividual phenomena we should expect to find if the theory under consideration were true."

Using causal inference tools for observational studies, we aimed to estimate the total putative causal effects of the most relevant factors for persistent and severe PTSD in Syrian refugee children living in Informal Tented Settlements (ITS) in Lebanon. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of Syrian refugee families living in ITS in Lebanon (BIOPATH study) was analysed. Families with children aged 8-16 years that had left Syria less than 4 years prior to recruitment were included. The first wave was conducted between October 2017 and January 2018. Follow-up data collection was conducted one year later (51.55 +/- 1.84 weeks). A subsample of 134 children was assessed with a structured clinical interview six months after the follow-up (27.02 +/- 7.16 weeks), between December 2018 and August 2019. Of the 2282 families approached in 77 selected settlements, 1600 (70.1%) agreed to participate. After one year, 1438 families were approached and data collected from 1009 families (62.8% re-participation rate). Data from 9 families were excluded during data cleaning. Ninety-eight variables across multiple domains (demographic, psychological, familial and community level) were measured using validated questionnaires and considered for a systematic causal discovery and inference method. Increased risk for severe and persistent PTSD based on symptom score was the primary outcome of interest. This outcome was validated a posteriori through structured clinical interviews in a subsample.  Results: 1591 child-caregiver dyads were included (age = 11.44 +/- 2.44 years, 52.6% female) and 16.2% of children were at classified as at risk for severe and persistent PTSD (DSM-5 confirmed diagnoses in clinical interviews 6 months later 62.5% vs 34.5% in children with lower risk, p&lt;.05; clinical severity score 4.5 vs 3.4, p&lt;.01). In the systematic causal discovery and inference analysis, the level of war exposure (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11 , p&lt;.01), peer violence victimisation (OR: 1.05 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, p&lt;.05), neglect (OR: 1.11 , 95% CI: 1.05-1.17 , p&lt;.01), maltreatment (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.07 , p&lt;.05) and caregiver depression (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.01-1.17 , p&lt;.05) predicted risk for persistent and severe PTSD. The quality of the concurrent refugee environment (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.77, p&lt;.01) was strongly negatively associated with severe and persistent PTSD presentations. Conclusion: Minimising violent re-victimization and exposure to daily stressors, and addressing caregiver mental health, might prevent the development of severe PTSD in refugee children."

Offering interim, brief interventions for distressed treatment-seekers can improve care access and mitigate adverse effects of long waiting times. This study proposes to test the efficacy of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), a strengths-based, goal-directed intervention, for psychological distress in help-seeking adolescents and young adults.  Methods: We will conduct a fully-powered, randomised, single-centre, two-armed, parallel, superiority, controlled trial. From September 2023 to March 2025, the study will recruit 124 participants (ages 16-30) presenting at a national youth mental health service in Singapore (CHAT, Centre of Excellence for Youth Mental Health) with clinically-assessed non-specific psychological distress, subthreshold or prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of a mood disorder. Participants will be excluded if they have high suicidal risk, psychosis, cognitive impairments, or current psychological treatments. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive six-session, case manager-delivered SFBT or treatment as usual (TAU), case management. Participants receiving SFBT are hypothesized to have greater improvements in self-reported psychological distress, from baseline to eight weeks, compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes are self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment. The study will additionally explore if SFBT is associated with: 1) increased self-efficacy and decreased hopelessness; 2) decreased downstream referrals at post-intervention; and 3) sustained clinical gains at three months post-intervention, compared to TAU.   Significance: Results have implications for expanding capacity of mental health services and enhancing capabilities of frontline case managers to provide timely and low-intensity evidence-based interventions to improve the mental health of young persons in Singapore."

To be effective, such ‘epistemic pretense’ requires us to anticipate how we would behave with different knowledge, and then to act in accord with that counterfactual knowledge state. Decades of research on hindsight bias suggest that people are poor at appreciating how they would behave when ignorant. In stark contrast, here we discover a remarkable capacity to simulate decision-making under a counterfactual knowledge state, by comparing real and ‘pretend’ play in two large-scale gamified experiments. Subjects saw the full solution to a game (e.g., all ship locations in Battleship, or the hidden word in Hangman) but then attempted to play as though they didn’t have this information. Impressively, they mimicked broad and subtle patterns of ordinary play, completely convincing peers of their ignorance. Nevertheless, computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in their decisions, consistent with a schematic simulation of their minds. Opening up a new approach to studying self-simulation, our results reveal intricate metacognitive knowledge about decision-making, drawn from a rich—but simplified—internal model of cognition."

One manifestation of this is the rich pattern of semantic similarity effects found in immediate serial recall tasks. These effects differ from the effects of similarity on other dimensions (e.g., phonological similarity), which renders them difficult to explain. We propose a comprehensive mechanistic explanation of semantic similarity effects by extending a standard connectionist architecture for modeling immediate serial recall to incorporate semantic representations. Central to our proposal is the selective encoding of categorical features shared among multiple list-items. The selective encoding of shared semantic features is made possible via a tagging mechanism that enables the model to encode shared feature retrospectively. Through this category-encoding mechanism, our model accounts for the majority of semantic similarity effects. Our results imply that working memory represents semantic information in a more restricted way than phonological information."

Emotion words may be particularly important for facilitating access to the emotion concepts. Indeed, deficits in semantic processing or impaired access to emotion words interfere with emotion perception. Yet, it is unclear what these behavioral findings mean for affective neuroscience. Thus, we examined the brain areas that support processing of emotion words using representational similarity analysis of fMRI data (N = 25). In the task, participants saw 10 emotion words (e.g., “anger”, “happiness”) while in the scanner. Participants rated each word based on its valence on a continuous scale ranging from 0 (Pleasant/Good) to 1 (Unpleasant/Bad) scale to ensure they were processing the words. Our results revealed that a diverse range of brain areas including prefrontal, midline cortical, and sensorimotor regions contained information about emotion words. Notably, our results overlapped with many regions implicated in decoding emotion experience by prior studies. Our results raise questions about what processes are being supported by these regions during emotion experience."

In two samples of German adolescents (14–20 years; N = 3,162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), whose 32 skill facets from five domains enable a fine-grained SEB skill assessment. Bivariate analyses and multilevel analyses of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) identified parental education and migration background as key drivers of inequalities in almost all skills, especially in the Innovation domain. Gender and school track generated smaller and less consistent differences, mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Intersectional interactions contributed only modestly to SEB skill differences. We conclude that social inequality in SEB is non-negligible and unfolds primarily as additive effects."

It is unknown whether early screen media exposure exacerbates the association between infant regulatory problems and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Methods: We studied 10,170 individuals from the Growing Up in Ireland ’08 cohort. Parents reported on their children’s regulatory problems at 9 months, screen media exposure at 3 years, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. Children were categorized based on their patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms using parallel process latent class growth analysis. Subsequently, multinominal logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate whether screen media exposure (&gt;1 hour or &gt;2 hours) moderated the association between regulatory problems in infancy and co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptom classes across childhood.  Results: There were four groups of children with distinct patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms: 1) low stable internalizing and low decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 6236; 61.3%); 2) low stable internalizing and moderate stable externalizing symptoms (N= 2029; 20%); 3) moderate increasing internalizing and moderate decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 1263; 12.4%); 4) moderate increasing internalizing and high increasing externalizing symptoms (N= 642; 6.3%). Presence of regulatory problems at 9 months and excessive screen media exposure at 3 years (particularly &gt;2 hours) were independently associated with increased likelihood of all classes. Excessive screen media exposure at 3 years did not significantly moderate the association between regulatory problems at 9 months and internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Conclusions: Both regulatory problems in infancy and screen media exposure &gt;2 hours in early childhood are early risk factors for the development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

One open question is which facial features observers use to recognize the different expressions and whether the features indicated by observers can be used to predict which expression they saw. We created fine-grained maps of diagnostic facial features by asking participants to use mouse clicks to highlight those parts of a face that they deem useful for recognizing its expression. We tested how well the resulting maps align with models of emotion expressions (based on Action Units) and how the maps relate to the accuracy with which observers recognize full or partly masked faces. As expected, observers focused on the eyes and mouth regions in all faces. However, each expression deviated from this global pattern in a unique way, allowing to create maps of diagnostic face regions. Action Units considered most important for expressing an emotion were highlighted most often, indicating their psychological validity. The maps of facial features also allowed to correctly predict which expression a participant had seen, with above-chance accuracies for all expressions. For happiness, fear and anger, the face half which was highlighted the most was also the half whose visibility led to higher recognition accuracies.  The results suggest that diagnostic facial features are distributed in unique patterns for each expression, which observers seem to intuitively extract and use when categorizing facial displays of emotion."

We examine whether adolescents’ SEB skills differ based on parental education, gender, migration background, school track—and the intersections thereof. In two samples of German adolescents (14–20 years; N = 3,162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), whose 32 skill facets from five domains enable a fine-grained SEB skill assessment. Bivariate analyses and multilevel analyses of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) identified parental education and migration background as key drivers of inequalities in almost all skills, especially in the Innovation domain. Gender and school track generated smaller and less consistent differences, mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Intersectional interactions contributed only modestly to SEB skill differences. We conclude that social inequality in SEB is non-negligible and unfolds primarily as additive effects."

Lee, Ajay Satpute","Although emotion words such as “anger”, “disgust”, “happiness”, or “pride” are often thought of as mere labels, increasing evidence points to language as being important for emotion perception and experience. Emotion words may be particularly important for facilitating access to the emotion concepts. Indeed, deficits in semantic processing or impaired access to emotion words interfere with emotion perception. Yet, it is unclear what these behavioral findings mean for affective neuroscience. Thus, we examined the brain areas that support processing of emotion words using representational similarity analysis of fMRI data (N = 25). In the task, participants saw 10 emotion words (e.g., “anger”, “happiness”) while in the scanner. Participants rated each word based on its valence on a continuous scale ranging from 0 (Pleasant/Good) to 1 (Unpleasant/Bad) scale to ensure they were processing the words. Our results revealed that a diverse range of brain areas including prefrontal, midline cortical, and sensorimotor regions contained information about emotion words. Notably, our results overlapped with many regions implicated in decoding emotion experience by prior studies. Our results raise questions about what processes are being supported by these regions during emotion experience."

It is unknown whether early screen media exposure exacerbates the association between infant regulatory problems and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Methods: We studied 10,170 individuals from the Growing Up in Ireland ’08 cohort. Parents reported on their children’s regulatory problems at 9 months, screen media exposure at 3 years, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. Children were categorized based on their patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms using parallel process latent class growth analysis. Subsequently, multinominal logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate whether screen media exposure (&gt;1 hour or &gt;2 hours) moderated the association between regulatory problems in infancy and co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptom classes across childhood.  Results: There were four groups of children with distinct patterns of co-developing internalizing and externalizing symptoms: 1) low stable internalizing and low decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 6236; 61.3%); 2) low stable internalizing and moderate stable externalizing symptoms (N= 2029; 20%); 3) moderate increasing internalizing and moderate decreasing externalizing symptoms (N= 1263; 12.4%); 4) moderate increasing internalizing and high increasing externalizing symptoms (N= 642; 6.3%). Presence of regulatory problems at 9 months and excessive screen media exposure at 3 years (particularly &gt;2 hours) were independently associated with increased likelihood of all classes. Excessive screen media exposure at 3 years did not significantly moderate the association between regulatory problems at 9 months and internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. Conclusions: Both regulatory problems in infancy and screen media exposure &gt;2 hours in early childhood are early risk factors for the development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, the association between infant regulatory problems and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptoms appears to operate independently of excessive screen media exposure. Clinicians should be aware of, and treat, regulatory problems in infancy to prevent chronic patterns of self-regulatory problems across childhood.

One manifestation of this is the rich pattern of semantic similarity effects found in immediate serial recall tasks. These effects differ from the effects of similarity on other dimensions (e.g., phonological similarity), which renders them difficult to explain. We propose a comprehensive mechanistic explanation of semantic similarity effects by extending a standard connectionist architecture for modeling immediate serial recall to incorporate semantic representations. Central to our proposal is the selective encoding of categorical features shared among multiple list-items. The selective encoding of shared semantic features is made possible via a tagging mechanism that enables the model to encode shared feature retrospectively. Through this category-encoding mechanism, our model accounts for the majority of semantic similarity effects. Our results imply that working memory represents semantic information in a more restricted way than phonological information."

To be effective, such ‘epistemic pretense’ requires us to anticipate how we would behave with different knowledge, and then to act in accord with that counterfactual knowledge state. Decades of research on hindsight bias suggest that people are poor at appreciating how they would behave when ignorant. In stark contrast, here we discover a remarkable capacity to simulate decision-making under a counterfactual knowledge state, by comparing real and ‘pretend’ play in two large-scale gamified experiments. Subjects saw the full solution to a game (e.g., all ship locations in Battleship, or the hidden word in Hangman) but then attempted to play as though they didn’t have this information. Impressively, they mimicked broad and subtle patterns of ordinary play, completely convincing peers of their ignorance. Nevertheless, computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in their decisions, consistent with a schematic simulation of their minds. Opening up a new approach to studying self-simulation, our results reveal intricate metacognitive knowledge about decision-making, drawn from a rich—but simplified—internal model of cognition."

Offering interim, brief interventions for distressed treatment-seekers can improve care access and mitigate adverse effects of long waiting times. This study proposes to test the efficacy of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), a strengths-based, goal-directed intervention, for psychological distress in help-seeking adolescents and young adults.  Methods: We will conduct a fully-powered, randomised, single-centre, two-armed, parallel, superiority, controlled trial. From September 2023 to March 2025, the study will recruit 124 participants (ages 16-30) presenting at a national youth mental health service in Singapore (CHAT, Centre of Excellence for Youth Mental Health) with clinically-assessed non-specific psychological distress, subthreshold or prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of a mood disorder. Participants will be excluded if they have high suicidal risk, psychosis, cognitive impairments, or current psychological treatments. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive six-session, case manager-delivered SFBT or treatment as usual (TAU), case management. Participants receiving SFBT are hypothesized to have greater improvements in self-reported psychological distress, from baseline to eight weeks, compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes are self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment. The study will additionally explore if SFBT is associated with: 1) increased self-efficacy and decreased hopelessness; 2) decreased downstream referrals at post-intervention; and 3) sustained clinical gains at three months post-intervention, compared to TAU.   Significance: Results have implications for expanding capacity of mental health services and enhancing capabilities of frontline case managers to provide timely and low-intensity evidence-based interventions to improve the mental health of young persons in Singapore."

Considering the evolution of the vertebrate brain illustrates how brain function must always be considered in the context of the goal-directed activity of the individual. The brain does not simply mediate between stimulus and response but is instead part of a reafferent loop that begins and ends with the activity of the organism. However, this emphasis on the inherently active individual is lost if we adopt a view of the brain as a computational device that passively processes input delivered to it from an external world. In this latter view, the organism is instructed by external information, but this approach fails to appreciate that the origin of all information reaching the brain is the activity of the organism itself. Related conceptual confusions about the nature of information characterize accounts of brain development that rely on the notion of instructions encoded in DNA. A more biologically coherent approach to brain development comes from theorizing in embodiment that emphasizes the inherent activity of the individual in the context of the wider developmental system."

In particular, if new teams are formed, e.g., in a company, they would benefit if (a) each team member can apply as many of his/her strengths as possible in the company and (b) the team members can cooperate and combine as many of their strengths as possible. Discovering such human resource potential in a company is a crucial creative task. Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that divergent thinking is associated with higher functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, psychological methods to improve awareness and regulation of neurocognitive processes involved in creativity (i.e., metacognition of creativity) and thereby boost such functional connections remain elusive.Based on neuropsychological findings from creativity research, we propose a metacognitive training for promoting creativity called intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA). In a role-play, participants were divided into two groups. Each group was tasked with finding out how to apply their strengths beneficially in a company (for example, a psychiatric clinic). The fluency and originality of their ideas were measured as dependent variables of creativity. In the experimental group, the proposed intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA) method was carried out, while the control group was supposed to solve the task using the common brainstorming method. The results show that IICA led to significantly higher fluency and originality rates than the control group. These data suggest that IICA can be a promising metacognitive method to promote team creativity and cooperation potential. Future studies should validate the effect of this method in further companies and investigate the neurobiological foundations of our approach using neurophysiological methods and computational modeling."

Here, in the face of this developmental change, we ask whether adolescents experience reward from word learning, and how the reward and memory benefit seen in adults is modulated by age. We used a naturalistic reading paradigm, which involved extracting novel word meanings from sentence context without the need for explicit feedback. By exploring ratings of enjoyment during the learning phase, as well as recognition memory for words a day later, we assessed whether adolescents show the same reward and learning patterns as adults. We tested 345 children between the ages of 10-18 (N&gt;84 in each 2-year age-band) using this paradigm. We found evidence for our first prediction: children aged 10-18 report greater enjoyment for successful word learning. However, we did not find evidence for age-related change in this developmental period, or memory benefits. This work gives us greater insight into the process of language acquisition and sets the stage for further investigations of intrinsic reward in typical and atypical development."

Here, in the face of this developmental change, we ask whether adolescents experience reward from word learning, and how the reward and memory benefit seen in adults is modulated by age. We used a naturalistic reading paradigm, which involved extracting novel word meanings from sentence context without the need for explicit feedback. By exploring ratings of enjoyment during the learning phase, as well as recognition memory for words a day later, we assessed whether adolescents show the same reward and learning patterns as adults. We tested 345 children between the ages of 10-18 (N&gt;84 in each 2-year age-band) using this paradigm. We found evidence for our first prediction: children aged 10-18 report greater enjoyment for successful word learning. However, we did not find evidence for age-related change in this developmental period, or memory benefits. This work gives us greater insight into the process of language acquisition and sets the stage for further investigations of intrinsic reward in typical and atypical development."

Marshall,"As the sophistication and reach of neuroscience methods increase, it is important to understand the implications of different conceptualizations of brain function. Considering the evolution of the vertebrate brain illustrates how brain function must always be considered in the context of the goal-directed activity of the individual. The brain does not simply mediate between stimulus and response but is instead part of a reafferent loop that begins and ends with the activity of the organism. However, this emphasis on the inherently active individual is lost if we adopt a view of the brain as a computational device that passively processes input delivered to it from an external world. In this latter view, the organism is instructed by external information, but this approach fails to appreciate that the origin of all information reaching the brain is the activity of the organism itself. Related conceptual confusions about the nature of information characterize accounts of brain development that rely on the notion of instructions encoded in DNA. A more biologically coherent approach to brain development comes from theorizing in embodiment that emphasizes the inherent activity of the individual in the context of the wider developmental system."

In particular, if new teams are formed, e.g., in a company, they would benefit if (a) each team member can apply as many of his/her strengths as possible in the company and (b) the team members can cooperate and combine as many of their strengths as possible. Discovering such human resource potential in a company is a crucial creative task. Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that divergent thinking is associated with higher functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, psychological methods to improve awareness and regulation of neurocognitive processes involved in creativity (i.e., metacognition of creativity) and thereby boost such functional connections remain elusive.Based on neuropsychological findings from creativity research, we propose a metacognitive training for promoting creativity called intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA). In a role-play, participants were divided into two groups. Each group was tasked with finding out how to apply their strengths beneficially in a company (for example, a psychiatric clinic). The fluency and originality of their ideas were measured as dependent variables of creativity. In the experimental group, the proposed intra- and interindividual connectivity analysis (IICA) method was carried out, while the control group was supposed to solve the task using the common brainstorming method. The results show that IICA led to significantly higher fluency and originality rates than the control group. These data suggest that IICA can be a promising metacognitive method to promote team creativity and cooperation potential. Future studies should validate the effect of this method in further companies and investigate the neurobiological foundations of our approach using neurophysiological methods and computational modeling."

Schoolchildren in Grades 3 (N = 199), 4 (N = 162), 5 (N = 174) and 6 (N = 180) completed 5 measures of reasoning and 2 measures of mathematical word problem solving. Our data showed that spatial reasoning contributed to both maths tasks in grades 4, 5 and 6 (0.02 - 0.08); analogical – to process of word problems solving in grades 5 and 6 (0.03); and verbal – to both maths tasks in all grades (.03-.08). Our results call for verbal and spatial ability to be routinely assessed and targeted by educational interventions within maths curriculum."

However, established measurement tools are infrequently used to, i) assess children’s mathematical skills and ii) identify children with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. In response, this pre-registered systematic review aimed to provide an overview of measurement tools that have been evaluated for their psychometric properties for measuring the mathematical skills of children aged 0-8 years. The reliability and validity evidence reported for the identified measurement tools were then synthesised, including in relation to common acceptability thresholds. Overall, 37 mathematical assessments and 22 screeners were identified. In addressing the first aim, most measurement tools were categorised as child-direct measures delivered individually with a trained assessor in a paper-based format. In addressing the second aim, the synthesis revealed four key findings. First, the majority of the identified measurement tools have not been evaluated for all aspects of reliability and validity, and only seven measurement tools met the common acceptability thresholds for more than two areas of psychometric evidence. Second, only three screeners demonstrated an acceptable ability to distinguish between typically developing children and those with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties. Third, although five mathematical assessments and six screeners included evaluations of predictive validity, none met the common acceptability threshold. Finally, only eight mathematical assessments and one screener were found to align with external measurement tools. Building on this current evidence and improving measurement quality is vital for raising methodological standards in mathematical learning and development research."

Thus, this tutorial paper has three main goals. First, we provide an overview of six parameterizations of individual participant meta-analysis, which we organize into a taxonomy based on different features of each parameterization (e.g., sample-specific parameters, meta-analytic parameters, number of models required). Second, using empirical data from 26,205 participants across 11 longitudinal studies, we provide a tutorial estimating each parameterization by investigating prospective meta-analytic and sample-specific associations between the Big Five personality traits and crystallized abilities along with four moderators of these associations. Finally, we compare convergence and divergence of findings across methods. We found that Openness is a robust predictor of crystallized abilities across samples and methods and that there were few moderators of personality trait-crystallized ability associations. Across methods, we largely see convergence in model estimates, with some exceptions. We conclude by making recommendations and providing a flow chart for choosing the most appropriate parameterization of data synthesis given a particular team’s research goals, questions, data availability, and model features."

In this paper, I consider findings from infant psychology and propose that our representations of social relationships are intuitive theories built on core knowledge. I propose three central components of this intuitive theory. The purpose of the first component is to recognize whether a relationship exists, the purpose of the second is to characterize the relationship by categorizing it into a model (i.e., type, schema, concept) and to compute its strength (i.e., intensity, pull, or thickness), and the purpose of the third is to understand how to change relationships through explicit or implicit communication. I propose that infants possess core knowledge on which this intuitive theory is built. This paper focuses on evidence for core knowledge that supports the second component on which the intuitive theory hinges—characterizing relationships. Following Relational Models Theory (A. P. Fiske, 1991, 2004), I propose that humans recognize relationships that belong to three models: communal sharing (where people see themselves as one), authority ranking (where people see themselves as ranked), and equality matching (where people see themselves as separate and track reciprocity). A single relationship can be organized according to any of these models depending on the context, but relationships tend to use one governing model. I further propose that humans recognize a relationship’s strength which can be thought of as a continuous representation of obligations (the extent to which certain actions are expected and morally evaluated), and commitment (the likelihood that people will continue the relationship). In communal sharing relationships, this may be felt as attachment, in authority ranking relationships it may be felt as allegiance or loyalty, and in equality matching relationships it may be felt as trust. One hypothesis regarding strength is that the stronger a connection, the less interchangeable the people. These representations, and the assumption that others share them, allow us to form, maintain, and change social relationships throughout our lives by informing how we interpret and evaluate the actions of others and plan our own."

In this paper, we present a computational model of category verification that allows linguistic distributional information and sensorimotor experience to interact in a grounded implementation of a full-size adult conceptual system. In simulations across multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the model performs the task of category verification at a level comparable to human participants, and – critically – that its operation naturally gives rise to the basic-level-advantage phenomenon. That is, concepts are easier to categorise when there is a high degree of overlap in sensorimotor experience and/or linguistic distributional knowledge between category and member concepts, and the basic-level advantage emerges as an overall behavioural artefact of this linguistic and sensorimotor overlap. Findings support the linguistic-sensorimotor preparation account of the basic-level advantage and, more broadly, linguistic-sensorimotor theories of the conceptual system."

We identify a taxonomy of face impression dimensions, and describe their coverage, prevalence, directionality, and correlational structure. We characterize a diverse and nuanced taxonomy of content that, when compared to just the content that dominant low-dimensional models focus on, increases the coverage of spontaneous responses from about 50% to almost 100%. Our results describe general patterns of prevalence, indicating that dimensions from low-dimensional models (e.g., Sociability, Morality, Assertiveness) are highly prevalent, but that alternative dimensions such as Uniqueness and Health, among others, are also significantly prevalent in face impressions of naturalistic face photographs. Most dimensions show a positivity bias, and the correlational structure of the dimensions further supports the clustering of low-dimensional model’s content as separate from the expanded taxonomy dimensions. Finally, this expanded taxonomy improves predictions of general evaluations and decision making in various real-world relevant contexts. The derived taxonomy of spontaneous face impressions content is a foundation for further theoretical development and practical applications in an area central to human behavior."

Recent proliferation of online (web-based) research has generated a growing need for reliable open-access vocabulary tests that can be administered online. This data report presents the newly developed 30-item Web-based Open-access Reliable Decision on Synonyms (WORDS) English Vocabulary Test. In Experiment 1, we tested 109 participants (age range: 18-69 years) on an initial set of 51 potential multiple-choice test items in which participants read a target word (e.g., ubiquitous) and selected a (near-)synonym (e.g., omnipresent) from among three semantically unrelated foils (e.g., interpersonal, catatonic, voluminous). We conducted an item response theory analysis of participants’ accuracy data to select an optimal subset of 30 items to include in the final version of the test. In Experiment 2, we verified the reliability of this 30-item version in a different sample (N = 121; 18-79 years); reliability (internal consistency) was good (Cronbach’s α = 0.82).

However, children vary widely in the amount of time they spend reading, and those who struggle to read are often less motivated to spend their free time reading. Lack of reading experience then leads to impoverished vocabulary and language knowledge. To determine whether removing print as a barrier to accessing more complex language would improve children’s vocabulary and other language skills, we conducted a randomized controlled trial intervention (RCT) study in which children listened to audiobooks along with text, either alone or with scaffolded instructional support. Third and fourth-grade students (N = 314, age: mean(SD) = 9.47(.56) years) were randomly assigned to Audiobooks-Only, Audiobooks+Scaffold, or Mindfulness (active control group) for 8 weeks. The results showed significant improvements in receptive and expressive vocabulary for the two audiobook groups compared to the control group. The effectiveness of the intervention varied based on reading ability and socioeconomic status (SES); poor readers benefited only in the Audiobooks+Scaffold group, whereas children from lower-SES backgrounds improved with audiobook access alone, especially if they were already proficient readers. Additionally, the Audiobooks+Scaffold group listened to more audiobooks during the study. These findings suggest that text-supplemented audiobooks, particularly when combined with personalized support, can be a valuable tool for supporting vocabulary development in struggling readers."

However, many popular language models are cognitively implausible on multiple fronts. For language models to offer plausible insights into human cognitive processing, they should implement a transparent and cognitively-plausible learning mechanism, should train on a quantity of text that is achievable in a human lifetime of language exposure, and should not assume to represent all of word meaning. When care is taken to create plausible language models within these constraints, they can be a powerful tool in uncovering the nature and scope of how language shapes semantic knowledge. The distributional relationships between words, which humans represent in memory as linguistic distributional knowledge, allow people to represent and process semantic information flexibly, robustly, and efficiently."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kmeaj,2024-03-08,Is Repetition Learning Preserved in Old Age? Insights from the Hebb Paradigm,To be fetched,"Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain."

Clinical scientists have spent considerable resources designing and testing depression interventions. However, due to low access to treatment for depression (more than 50% of adolescents with depression symptoms never access treatment at all) and the heterogeneity of depression itself (a major depression diagnosis reflects &gt;1400 possible symptom combinations), none have led to meaningful declines in depression’s overall burdens for adolescents. Rates of depression appear to be increasing, potentially more rapidly in adolescents compared to older groups in the US. Status-quo approaches are unlikely to sustainably improve adolescent depression. We propose that a critical and often overlooked contributor to this shortfall is youth autonomy—a key, developmentally-aligned need for adolescents—to reduce rates of depression at the population level. During adolescence, individuals begin to separate from their parents, guardians, and caregivers (hereafter caregivers), and make decisions independently. This process is critical for healthy identity formation, self-efficacy, and mental health—including prevention and reduction of depression. Youth autonomy is among myriad multi-level factors relevant to depression trajectories. However, unlike many social and structural contributors to depression, youths’ perceived autonomy is relatively modifiable through individual-level intervention, making it a promising intervention target. The psychosocial importance of youth autonomy stands in sharp contrast to modern policies and structures which undermine youth independence and control—including within many existing depression interventions. We summarize how existing youth depression interventions and mental health systems may inadvertently undermine youth autonomy. We then suggest strategies for redesigning existing interventions and policies in ways that directly promote adolescent autonomy, and in turn, help reduce depression at scale."

Such acoustic feedback can improve motor learning in healthy subjects (e.g., learning a new sport skill) and those with sensorimotor deficits (e.g., stroke patients and those suffering from deafferentiation). However, motor learning involves both developing feedforward inverse internal models for planning motor trajectories and developing a capacity to correct erroneous trajectories in real-time via online feedback control. This latter motor-control perspective has not been well-studied in movement sonification research and it is not known whether motor learning improvements from movement sonification are driven by improved inverse internal models, corrective real-time adjustments, or both. We searched for evidence of real-time adjustments (muscle twitches) in response to movement sonification by comparing the kinematics of reaches made with online and terminal sonification feedback. We found that reaches made with online feedback were significantly more jerky than reaches made with terminal feedback, indicating increased muscle twitching. Using a between-subject design, we found that online feedback was associated with improved motor learning of a reach path and target over terminal feedback; however, using a within-subjects design, we found that switching participants who had learned with online sonification feedback to terminal feedback was associated with a decrease in error. Thus, our results suggest that, with our task and sonification, movement sonification leads to online motor adjustments which improve motor trajectory planning, but which themselves are not helpful online corrections."

Appraisal theories predict that discrete emotions arise from a combination of components. Specifically, the Component Process Model (CPM) highlights the prime role of appraisal following motivation, expression, physiology and feeling. We include annotations from all these domains and reveal a hierarchical organisation of discrete emotions by appraisal of valence and self-relevance. Furthermore, we apply predictive models to understand the contribution of emotion components to discrete emotions. We find that all 13 discrete emotions in our dataset can be significantly predicted as a function of emotion components. Our study contributes key insights using machine learning to the longstanding question of what is an emotion and underscores the centrality of appraisal in the generation of emotion. This has important implications on the complexity and function of emotion as an adaptive process."

However, given the reliance on language-based skills to access ‘talking therapies’ (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), it is likely that interventions suited to the general population may be inaccessible for young people with language and literacy difficulties. As such, this scoping review aims to map the range of evidence in relation to interventions that support socioemotional wellbeing in young people with language and literacy difficulties. The review aims to identify gaps in the literature and guide future research.    Inclusion criteria: Studies will be included if they meet the following criteria: 1) The study includes participants aged up to and including 24 years with a diagnosed (or suspected diagnosis of) neurodevelopmental disorder impacting spoken and/or written language, and 2) the study reports on an intervention that targets (either directly or indirectly) the socioemotional wellbeing of those young people. Studies focusing on young people with acquired language or literacy difficulties will be excluded. This is because the nature of communication and/or socioemotional challenges among people with acquired conditions, and their subsequent needs for intervention, are likely to differ from those of young people experiencing language and literacy disorders that are developmental in nature.     Methods: A scoping review following the JBI guidelines will be conducted in March 2024 using search terms in English. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsychInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Central. Peer reviewed journal articles (primary studies) and dissertations/theses will be included. Using the Covidence platform, all references will be imported for review. Two independent reviewers will screen the identified studies in accordance with the eligibility criteria in two stages: 1) title and abstract screening, and 2) full text review. Any discrepancies in agreement will be resolved through discussion between the two reviewers, with a third reviewer to aid decision-making as needed. Data will be extracted from the included articles by two independent reviewers.    Results &amp; Conclusions: The findings will be presented as a narrative summary. The scoping review findings will provide readers with an overview of studies that have explored interventions for socioemotional wellbeing among young people with language and literacy difficulties. Gaps in the existing evidence base will be identified and findings will guide future research. The scoping review findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journal publication, plain language summaries, and presentation at conferences relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and/or mental health in young people."

This study also examined whether individual differences in attachment would influence treatment effectiveness. We randomly assigned a non-clinical sample of 125 community-dwelling adults to a control group or an intervention group. Those in the intervention group completed a brief intervention involving daily compassionate imagery exercises for one week. Those who completed the intervention demonstrated significant reductions in fears of compassion for others, fears of compassion from others, and fears of self-compassion, irrespective of differences in attachment. These findings support the efficacy of compassion focused imagery exercises in reducing fears of compassion across attachment patterns, suggesting their potential value in therapeutic settings for enhancing mental wellbeing and therapeutic outcomes."

Appraisal theories predict that discrete emotions arise from a combination of components. Specifically, the Component Process Model (CPM) highlights the prime role of appraisal following motivation, expression, physiology and feeling. We include annotations from all these domains and reveal a hierarchical organisation of discrete emotions by appraisal of valence and self-relevance. Furthermore, we apply predictive models to understand the contribution of emotion components to discrete emotions. We find that all 13 discrete emotions in our dataset can be significantly predicted as a function of emotion components. Our study contributes key insights using machine learning to the longstanding question of what is an emotion and underscores the centrality of appraisal in the generation of emotion. This has important implications on the complexity and function of emotion as an adaptive process."

We incorporated the Spatial Arrangement method in constructing individual representations and devel- oped a search algorithm to select useful triplets. This approach was applied in predicting NCAA men’s basketball team rank- ings. Our two-phase method involved first having 113 partic- ipants spatially map 50 teams, thereby capturing their unique mental representations. Then, we presented them with cus- tomized triplets of teams (e.g., Kansas, Gonzaga, Texas) de- signed to trigger context effects. Participants judged the like- lihood of one team ranking higher than the others. The re- sults indicated the presence of three context effects (similar- ity, attraction, compromise) in subjective probabilities (SPs). This approach not only shows that context effects can occur in real-world scenarios but also challenges the traditional support invariance assumption in psychological theories of SPs, sug- gesting that the construction of belief and preference may be influenced by similar cognitive processes."

Thirty (n = 30) volunteer subjects were randomly assigned to a group that received CA treatment and a group that received EMDR treatment. Investigators met with each participant for three sessions and took three measures (pretest and posttest). The Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40) was used to measure trauma symptoms, the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was used to measure central sensitization, and the Subjective Unit of Disturbance Scale (SUDS) was used to measure participants’ disturbance before and after processing a memory. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the differences between the two groups. The data provided statistical significance that CA was more effective than EMDR at reducing trauma symptoms on the TSC-40, sensitization on the CSI, and subjective disturbance on the SUDS."

Theoretically, these effects may depend on at least two conditions. First, the multilingual and bidialectal characteristics; particularly, (second) language proficiency and the sociolinguistic context of language use (e.g., Green &amp; Abutalebi, 2013). Second, the EF aspects examined; specifically, recent accounts of the locus of the multilingual effect propose a general EF effect rather than an impact on specific processes (Bialystok, 2017). We compared 52 “monolingual” (with limited additional-language/dialect experience), 79 bidialectal, and 50 multilingual young adults in the diglossic context of Cyprus, where bidialectalism is widespread and Cypriot and Standard Greek are used in different everyday situations. Three EF processes were examined via seven tasks: inhibition, switching, working memory (Miyake et al., 2000). We found better multilingual and bidialectal performance in overall EF, an effect moderated by high (second) language proficiency."

To better understand the representational content and cognitive processes of PS and their relation to general semantics, we adapted a staple of General semantic memory research, the Property generation task. We randomly assigned 240 adult participants to a traditional General semantics perspective (e.g., listing the properties of families and bedrooms in general) or to a PS perspective (e.g., my family, my bedroom). Relative to the General semantics condition, the PS condition was associated with more features; these were more semantically distant from each other, and more frequently included adjectives, verbs, and prepositions and less frequently nouns. However, the two conditions had substantial (~46%) overlap in the frequency of their features. The findings contribute to the identification of the cognitive differences (e.g., semantic richness) and similarities (e.g., correspondence in semantic features) between personal and general semantic memory."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ud67z,2024-03-07,Retrieval-Induced Semantic Interference,To be fetched,"The long-term negative effect of semantic retrieval on the subsequent accessibility of related material has been extensively studied in separate memory and language production literatures. Though ostensibly studying the same phenomenon, these literatures have remained separated by different framings and methodologies. We argue for integration of the two research streams in an adaptive learning perspective and present a bridging experiment as a proof of concept of this approach. The experiment implemented a multiphase retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) design (with generation and memory assessment phases) in combination with the use of naming latency measures and the temporal analysis of interference featured in language production research. The generation phase, typically unanalyzed in the memory literature, examined generation time for category-stem completions as a function of ordinal positions of related items. There was strong cumulative interference in generation latencies in the first pass though the structured list, showing that memory is already affected in this phase. After a retention interval, accessibility of new items from previously activated categories and unactivated controls was assessed using continuous picture naming rather than aggregate memory measures. Crucially, there was a picture naming cost to previously activated (but not generated) category members relative to the control condition, a RIF effect. This cost was supervenient on new cumulative interference in the assessment phase, underlining the value of the combined methodology. The findings add important detailing to the processes underlying retrieval-induced costs in memory research while also showing that retrieval-induced semantic interference transfers from stem-completion to picture naming retrieval tasks. This format-independence is consistent with a conceptual basis of semantic interference but does not preclude a locus of adaptive learning in conceptual-lexical links. Overall, we show that the memory and language production fields are indeed different but complementary perspectives on the same semantic interference phenomenon. Combining the fields promises to be productive."

However, it is possible that experiment participants adjust their behavior when they know their eyes are being tracked.  This potential change would be considered a type of Hawthorne effect, in which participants alter their behavior in response to being watched, and could potentially compromise the outcomes and conclusions of experimental studies that use eye tracking.  We examined whether eye-tracking produced Hawthorne effects in six commonly used psychological scales and five behavioral tasks.  The dependent measures were selected because they are widely used and cited and because they involved measures of sensitive topics, including gambling behavior, racial bias, undesirable personality characteristics, or because they require working memory or executive attention resources, which might be affected by Hawthorne effects.  The only task where Hawthorne effects manifested was the mixed gambles task, in which participants accepted or rejected gambles involving a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing different monetary amounts.  Participants in the eye-tracking condition accepted fewer gambles that were low in expected value, and they also took longer to respond for these low-value gambles.  These results suggest that eye-tracking is not likely to produce Hawthorne effects in most common psychology laboratory tasks, except for those involving risky decisions where the probability of the outcomes from each choice are known."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/c2ak6,2024-03-07,"Conscious and resilient? Associations between temperament, emotional awareness, and emotion regulation strategies in youth",To be fetched,"Introduction: Emotion regulation (ER) is of utmost importance for emotional wellbeing. However, during early adolescence the use of adaptive ER strategies is challenging since the underlying cognitive systems for ER are still maturing. Furthermore, youth show large variation in ER strategy use as various child factors including temperament (i.e., Positive Emotionality (PE), Negative Emotionality (NE)) and emotional awareness (EA) contribute to the development of ER strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the way in which temperament, EA and ER strategies interact. We predicted temperament to contribute to the development of ER strategies whereby EA was associated with ER and moderated the association between (a) PE and adaptive ER strategies, and (b) NE and adaptive ER strategies in a facilitating way - and in a buffering way for the relationship between (c) PE and maladaptive ER strategies, and (d) NE and maladaptive ER strategies. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, the study included a community sample of adolescents (n = 220). Temperament was measured using the PANAS-C (Laurent et al., 1999) and EA was measured with the DERS (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). ER strategies were assessed using the FEEL-KJ (Braet et al., 2013). Results &amp; Conclusions:  Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed an interaction effect for NE and EA on maladaptive ER strategies. Yet, this moderating role of EA could not be described as buffering. The present findings suggest that the role of EA is complex in youth with temperamental vulnerability."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7y3br,2024-03-07,Could our tendency to lie be changed by metacognitive activity prior to making decisions in moral dilemmas?,To be fetched,"Moral judgments of hypothetical real-life moral dilemmas provide scientists valuable insight into the foundational psychological processes that underlie human moral cognition. Moral identity is a construct at the intersection of moral development and identity formation. It is thought to be a source of moral motivation linking moral reasoning (our judgments about whether certain actions are right or wrong) to behavior (Hardy &amp; Carlo, 2011). Metacognitive regulation describes how people monitor and control their cognitive processes. For instance, when we realize that the strategy we use to solve a math problem is not working, we try another approach (Nelson &amp; Narens, 1990). In this study, three different dimensions that have been studied very little before are brought together and we sought an answer to the question of how metacognitive activity affects our decisions in moral dilemma scenarios. The study aims to measure the effect of metacognitive activity on morally-right decision-making in moral dilemmas. The first hypothesis of this study is ""If participants engage in moral metacognition before encountering moral dilemmas, their orientation towards truth increases”. A second hypothesis, in conjunction with the first one, is ""When people are faced with moral dilemmas, it is assumed that there is a negative relationship between the tendency of people with high and low moral identity scores to lie.” 34 individuals from Yeditepe University participated in the study. The data of the study were collected through Google forms and PsychoPy v2023.1.1. The experimental group was first asked to fill in the moral identity questionnaire, and then they were expected to fill out the moral metacognition questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire-filling process, the participants were subjected to 4 different moral dilemma scenarios while the control group answered the moral dilemma scenarios without completing the moral metacognition questionnaire. Statistical analyzes were made using JASP 0.17.0. According to the results, there are no significant differences between Moral Metacognition Activity and the tendency to tell the truth based on One-Way ANOVA. All three dimensions have a positive correlation, but the correlation between the Moral Metacognition score and the moral identity score is significant. Also, the correlation between Moral Metacognition and Total True Answer is significant too. When we analyzed the truth and lie tendency given to the scenarios, it has been shown that the interests of the individuals are more in the scenarios that concern and affect their own lives. Our results suggest that people are willing to lie for their own benefit."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/t2m5u,2024-03-07,The role of episodic memory in causal reasoning with counterfactuals: A perspective from predictive processing and trace minimalism,To be fetched,"Over the past several years, there has been a shift in the researchers’ thinking about the functional role of episodic memory. Rather than focusing on how memory represents the past, recent literature often presents memory as ultimately dealing with the future–helping the organism to anticipate events and increase its adaptive success. However, the distinct contribution of episodic (as opposed to semantic) memory to future-oriented simulations remains unclear. We claim that episodic memory yields adaptive success because of its crucial role in singular counterfactual causal reasoning, which thus far has been mostly ignored in causal reasoning literature. Our paper presents a causal inference model based on the predictive processing framework and the minimal trace account of episodic memory. According to our model, evaluating the cause of an event involves (i) generating an episodic memory related to the said potential cause, (ii) constructing a counterfactual scenario through inhibition of the relevant part of the past episode, and (iii) temporal evolution followed by alternative model evaluation. We further discuss our approach in the developmental context."

Research that explores and intervenes to address in-hospital stress and ameliorate negative patient outcomes requires a valid measurement tool. The Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed for this purpose. The aims of the current study were to psychometrically validate the HSQ, identify latent factors, reduce the number of items within the HSQ, and explore the psychometric properties of longer and shorter versions of the scale. Methods A nationally representative sample of recent NHS hospital inpatients (N = 660; mean age = 54.0, range = 18–97) completed the HSQ within a survey of patient experiences; 32 of which completed the measure a second time two weeks later. Factor structure, convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive validity, and test-retest reliability were assessed. Results Seven domains of in-hospital stress were identified: quality of care, away from home, inconvenienced, health anxiety, negative effects of treatment, ward environment, and disrupted patient experience. Long (55 items), medium (28 items), and short (10 items) versions of the measure were produced, all exhibiting excellent psychometric properties. The highest rated stressor was “poor sleep”. Conclusion The HSQ is a valid and reliable tool, now available to be used by researchers and clinicians. It has potential to be used in intervention studies to reduce in-hospital stress, and to identify patients most at risk of the effects of post-hospital syndrome."

Using a method described by Mõttus and colleagues (2023) we obtained noise- and bias-free ‘true’ correlations (rtrues), which were used to produce regression model estimates of the true independent associations (βtrues) of age, sex and Big Five personality domains with loneliness across three multicultural samples (Estonian-speaking, n = 20,893; Russian-speaking, n = 762; English-speaking, n = 600). Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant. Overall, we find that loneliness is far more closely related to Neuroticism than previously understood, and distinct from both social isolation and social disconnection."

Evidence suggests that these hospital-related stressors negatively impact health: a phenomenon known as post-hospital syndrome. The current study aimed to identify hospital-related stressors, and to develop and provide initial validation for a new measure of in-hospital stress. Methods Measure development occurred in three stages: (i) semi-structured interviews, (ii) item generation, and (iii) pilot testing. Twenty-one patients were interviewed regarding their recent hospital experiences, and a list of hospital-related stressors was produced. These stressors were compiled into a questionnaire and piloted on 200 recent inpatients to provide initial evidence of internal consistency and construct validity. Results Stressors identified from the interviews captured all relevant questions from three previous hospital stress measures, plus 12 more. The most reported stressor was ‘poor sleep’. These hospital-related stressors were developed into 67 questions, forming the Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ). The HSQ showed excellent internal consistency and construct validity, and correlated with feelings of vulnerability and being unprepared to go home. Conclusion The HSQ is a promising self-report tool for measuring in-hospital stress. Future research ought to investigate its psychometric properties further in larger and more diverse samples. The measure has potential to be used to monitor patient risk of post-hospital syndrome."

This potential change would be considered a type of Hawthorne effect, in which participants alter their behavior in response to being watched, and could potentially compromise the outcomes and conclusions of experimental studies that use eye tracking.  We examined whether eye-tracking produced Hawthorne effects in six commonly used psychological scales and five behavioral tasks.  The dependent measures were selected because they are widely used and cited and because they involved measures of sensitive topics, including gambling behavior, racial bias, undesirable personality characteristics, or because they require working memory or executive attention resources, which might be affected by Hawthorne effects.  The only task where Hawthorne effects manifested was the mixed gambles task, in which participants accepted or rejected gambles involving a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing different monetary amounts.  Participants in the eye-tracking condition accepted fewer gambles that were low in expected value, and they also took longer to respond for these low-value gambles.  These results suggest that eye-tracking is not likely to produce Hawthorne effects in most common psychology laboratory tasks, except for those involving risky decisions where the probability of the outcomes from each choice are known."

Rather than focusing on how memory represents the past, recent literature often presents memory as ultimately dealing with the future–helping the organism to anticipate events and increase its adaptive success. However, the distinct contribution of episodic (as opposed to semantic) memory to future-oriented simulations remains unclear. We claim that episodic memory yields adaptive success because of its crucial role in singular counterfactual causal reasoning, which thus far has been mostly ignored in causal reasoning literature. Our paper presents a causal inference model based on the predictive processing framework and the minimal trace account of episodic memory. According to our model, evaluating the cause of an event involves (i) generating an episodic memory related to the said potential cause, (ii) constructing a counterfactual scenario through inhibition of the relevant part of the past episode, and (iii) temporal evolution followed by alternative model evaluation. We further discuss our approach in the developmental context."

Moral identity is a construct at the intersection of moral development and identity formation. It is thought to be a source of moral motivation linking moral reasoning (our judgments about whether certain actions are right or wrong) to behavior (Hardy &amp; Carlo, 2011). Metacognitive regulation describes how people monitor and control their cognitive processes. For instance, when we realize that the strategy we use to solve a math problem is not working, we try another approach (Nelson &amp; Narens, 1990). In this study, three different dimensions that have been studied very little before are brought together and we sought an answer to the question of how metacognitive activity affects our decisions in moral dilemma scenarios. The study aims to measure the effect of metacognitive activity on morally-right decision-making in moral dilemmas. The first hypothesis of this study is ""If participants engage in moral metacognition before encountering moral dilemmas, their orientation towards truth increases”. A second hypothesis, in conjunction with the first one, is ""When people are faced with moral dilemmas, it is assumed that there is a negative relationship between the tendency of people with high and low moral identity scores to lie.” 34 individuals from Yeditepe University participated in the study. The data of the study were collected through Google forms and PsychoPy v2023.1.1. The experimental group was first asked to fill in the moral identity questionnaire, and then they were expected to fill out the moral metacognition questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire-filling process, the participants were subjected to 4 different moral dilemma scenarios while the control group answered the moral dilemma scenarios without completing the moral metacognition questionnaire. Statistical analyzes were made using JASP 0.17.0. According to the results, there are no significant differences between Moral Metacognition Activity and the tendency to tell the truth based on One-Way ANOVA. All three dimensions have a positive correlation, but the correlation between the Moral Metacognition score and the moral identity score is significant. Also, the correlation between Moral Metacognition and Total True Answer is significant too. When we analyzed the truth and lie tendency given to the scenarios, it has been shown that the interests of the individuals are more in the scenarios that concern and affect their own lives. Our results suggest that people are willing to lie for their own benefit."

W. Koster, Marie-Lotte Van Beveren, Caroline Braet","Introduction: Emotion regulation (ER) is of utmost importance for emotional wellbeing. However, during early adolescence the use of adaptive ER strategies is challenging since the underlying cognitive systems for ER are still maturing. Furthermore, youth show large variation in ER strategy use as various child factors including temperament (i.e., Positive Emotionality (PE), Negative Emotionality (NE)) and emotional awareness (EA) contribute to the development of ER strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the way in which temperament, EA and ER strategies interact. We predicted temperament to contribute to the development of ER strategies whereby EA was associated with ER and moderated the association between (a) PE and adaptive ER strategies, and (b) NE and adaptive ER strategies in a facilitating way - and in a buffering way for the relationship between (c) PE and maladaptive ER strategies, and (d) NE and maladaptive ER strategies. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, the study included a community sample of adolescents (n = 220). Temperament was measured using the PANAS-C (Laurent et al., 1999) and EA was measured with the DERS (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). ER strategies were assessed using the FEEL-KJ (Braet et al., 2013). Results &amp; Conclusions:  Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed an interaction effect for NE and EA on maladaptive ER strategies. Yet, this moderating role of EA could not be described as buffering. The present findings suggest that the role of EA is complex in youth with temperamental vulnerability."

Research that explores and intervenes to address in-hospital stress and ameliorate negative patient outcomes requires a valid measurement tool. The Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed for this purpose. The aims of the current study were to psychometrically validate the HSQ, identify latent factors, reduce the number of items within the HSQ, and explore the psychometric properties of longer and shorter versions of the scale. Methods A nationally representative sample of recent NHS hospital inpatients (N = 660; mean age = 54.0, range = 18–97) completed the HSQ within a survey of patient experiences; 32 of which completed the measure a second time two weeks later. Factor structure, convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive validity, and test-retest reliability were assessed. Results Seven domains of in-hospital stress were identified: quality of care, away from home, inconvenienced, health anxiety, negative effects of treatment, ward environment, and disrupted patient experience. Long (55 items), medium (28 items), and short (10 items) versions of the measure were produced, all exhibiting excellent psychometric properties. The highest rated stressor was “poor sleep”. Conclusion The HSQ is a valid and reliable tool, now available to be used by researchers and clinicians. It has potential to be used in intervention studies to reduce in-hospital stress, and to identify patients most at risk of the effects of post-hospital syndrome."

Evidence suggests that these hospital-related stressors negatively impact health: a phenomenon known as post-hospital syndrome. The current study aimed to identify hospital-related stressors, and to develop and provide initial validation for a new measure of in-hospital stress. Methods Measure development occurred in three stages: (i) semi-structured interviews, (ii) item generation, and (iii) pilot testing. Twenty-one patients were interviewed regarding their recent hospital experiences, and a list of hospital-related stressors was produced. These stressors were compiled into a questionnaire and piloted on 200 recent inpatients to provide initial evidence of internal consistency and construct validity. Results Stressors identified from the interviews captured all relevant questions from three previous hospital stress measures, plus 12 more. The most reported stressor was ‘poor sleep’. These hospital-related stressors were developed into 67 questions, forming the Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ). The HSQ showed excellent internal consistency and construct validity, and correlated with feelings of vulnerability and being unprepared to go home. Conclusion The HSQ is a promising self-report tool for measuring in-hospital stress. Future research ought to investigate its psychometric properties further in larger and more diverse samples. The measure has potential to be used to monitor patient risk of post-hospital syndrome."

Using a method described by Mõttus and colleagues (2023) we obtained noise- and bias-free ‘true’ correlations (rtrues), which were used to produce regression model estimates of the true independent associations (βtrues) of age, sex and Big Five personality domains with loneliness across three multicultural samples (Estonian-speaking, n = 20,893; Russian-speaking, n = 762; English-speaking, n = 600). Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant. Overall, we find that loneliness is far more closely related to Neuroticism than previously understood, and distinct from both social isolation and social disconnection."

Hambric, Padraig O'Seaghdha","The long-term negative effect of semantic retrieval on the subsequent accessibility of related material has been extensively studied in separate memory and language production literatures. Though ostensibly studying the same phenomenon, these literatures have remained separated by different framings and methodologies. We argue for integration of the two research streams in an adaptive learning perspective and present a bridging experiment as a proof of concept of this approach. The experiment implemented a multiphase retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) design (with generation and memory assessment phases) in combination with the use of naming latency measures and the temporal analysis of interference featured in language production research. The generation phase, typically unanalyzed in the memory literature, examined generation time for category-stem completions as a function of ordinal positions of related items. There was strong cumulative interference in generation latencies in the first pass though the structured list, showing that memory is already affected in this phase. After a retention interval, accessibility of new items from previously activated categories and unactivated controls was assessed using continuous picture naming rather than aggregate memory measures. Crucially, there was a picture naming cost to previously activated (but not generated) category members relative to the control condition, a RIF effect. This cost was supervenient on new cumulative interference in the assessment phase, underlining the value of the combined methodology. The findings add important detailing to the processes underlying retrieval-induced costs in memory research while also showing that retrieval-induced semantic interference transfers from stem-completion to picture naming retrieval tasks. This format-independence is consistent with a conceptual basis of semantic interference but does not preclude a locus of adaptive learning in conceptual-lexical links. Overall, we show that the memory and language production fields are indeed different but complementary perspectives on the same semantic interference phenomenon. Combining the fields promises to be productive."

Theoretically, these effects may depend on at least two conditions. First, the multilingual and bidialectal characteristics; particularly, (second) language proficiency and the sociolinguistic context of language use (e.g., Green &amp; Abutalebi, 2013). Second, the EF aspects examined; specifically, recent accounts of the locus of the multilingual effect propose a general EF effect rather than an impact on specific processes (Bialystok, 2017). We compared 52 “monolingual” (with limited additional-language/dialect experience), 79 bidialectal, and 50 multilingual young adults in the diglossic context of Cyprus, where bidialectalism is widespread and Cypriot and Standard Greek are used in different everyday situations. Three EF processes were examined via seven tasks: inhibition, switching, working memory (Miyake et al., 2000). We found better multilingual and bidialectal performance in overall EF, an effect moderated by high (second) language proficiency."

To better understand the representational content and cognitive processes of PS and their relation to general semantics, we adapted a staple of General semantic memory research, the Property generation task. We randomly assigned 240 adult participants to a traditional General semantics perspective (e.g., listing the properties of families and bedrooms in general) or to a PS perspective (e.g., my family, my bedroom). Relative to the General semantics condition, the PS condition was associated with more features; these were more semantically distant from each other, and more frequently included adjectives, verbs, and prepositions and less frequently nouns. However, the two conditions had substantial (~46%) overlap in the frequency of their features. The findings contribute to the identification of the cognitive differences (e.g., semantic richness) and similarities (e.g., correspondence in semantic features) between personal and general semantic memory."

Als Antwort auf diese Herausforderungen wird aktuell im Rahmen eines Konsortiums eine Hierarchische Taxonomie der Psychopathologie (HiTOP) entwickelt – ein empirisch fundiertes, hierarchisch organisiertes, und dimensionales Modell zur Beschreibung psychischer Probleme. In diesem Artikel wird das HiTOP-Modell erstmals in umfassender Weise für den deutschsprachigen Raum zugänglich gemacht. Nach einer Kritik an aktuellen Klassifikationssystemen erläutern wir zunächst die methodischen Grundprinzien von HiTOP und stellen das aktuell gültige Modell vor.

Tournament chess players receive objective, precise, and public feedback, so we conducted a preregistered survey experiment and replication to learn whether overconfidence persists in an environment that should diminish or eradicate it. Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience. On average, participants asserted their ability was 89 Elo rating points higher than their observed ratings indicated—expecting to outscore an equally-rated opponent by 2:1. One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated. These patterns emerged in every sociodemographic subgroup we considered. We conclude that overconfidence persists even in real-world information environments that should be inhospitable to it."

However, most psychological research has focused on interpersonal rather than intergroup effects to understand the link between social exclusion and aggression. We compared the effects of intergroup and interpersonal using RateME, a new task designed to dissociate both types of exclusion, and Cyberball in a sample of 1200 UK residents. Intergroup exclusion elicited by RateME and interpersonal exclusion elicited by both RateME and Cyberball were independently associated with increased psychological distress and state hostility, regardless of participants’ degree of identification with the group. Exclusion of either type also increased collective narcissism, especially in participants who had experienced higher levels of psychological distress. Our work reveals similar detrimental psychological effects of intergroup exclusion compared to interpersonal exclusion, highlighting intergroup exclusion as a risk factor for mental health with potential implications for violent extremism."

Here, we examine this issue systematically for multinomial processing tree (MPT) models, a popular class of cognitive models for categorical data. Specifically, we examine the robustness of MPT model parameter estimates that arise from two important decisions: the level of data aggregation (complete pooling, no pooling, or partial pooling) and the statistical framework (frequentist or Bayesian). These decisions span a multiverse of estimation methods. We synthesized the data from 13,956 participants (164 published data sets) with a meta-analytic strategy and analyzed the magnitude of divergence between estimation methods for the parameters of nine popular multinomial processing tree (MPT) models in psychology (e.g., process dissociation, source monitoring). We further examined moderators as potential sources of divergence. We found that the absolute divergence between estimation methods was small on average (&lt; .04; with MPT parameters ranging between 0 and 1); in some cases, however, divergence amounted to nearly the maximum possible range (.97). Divergence was partly explained by few moderators (e.g., the specific MPT model parameter, uncertainty in parameter estimation), but not by other plausible candidate moderators (e.g., parameter trade-offs, parameter correlations) or their interactions. Partial-pooling methods showed the smallest divergence within and across levels of pooling and thus seem to be an appropriate default method. Using MPT models as an example, we show how transparency and robustness can be increased in the field of cognitive modeling."

However, previous studies mainly focused on support from partner or general social support and neglected the roles of grandparents. Here, we examine whether a lack of grandparental support is related to increased risk of a diagnosis of perinatal depression. In addition, we examine whether poor grandparental support is related to more depressive symptoms in mothers with and without perinatal depression and whether perceived grandparental support buffers against parenting difficulties in mothers with perinatal depression. Methods: The sample was drawn from an Australian pregnancy cohort study and consisted of 725 women, including 230 women who met criteria for Major Depression. At 12 months postpartum, women reported on grandparental geographical proximity and hours of grandparental childcare support. Perceived grandparental support was assessed with the Postpartum Social Support Questionnaire and parenting difficulties and depressive symptoms with the Parenting Stress Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: Perceived grandparental support was related to fewer depressive symptoms among mothers with perinatal depression. In addition, higher levels of perceived grandparental support were related to lower parenting stress in mothers with and without perinatal depression. Limitations: Intergenerational conflicts and quality of grandparenting were not assessed. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that supportive grandparents may prevent the development of more severe perinatal depression in mothers experiencing perinatal mental health problems. Future studies should examine whether involving grandparents in treatment may add to the effectiveness of existing perinatal mental health interventions."

However, research has shown that families maintain a preference for face-to-face assessments. We examined families' anxieties both before and after having an online assessment to determine whether any initial concerns are due to a lack of exposure and information surrounding online assessments, as opposed to the quality of the assessment itself. We also aimed to understand how referral services can help families choose an online autism assessment for their child. Is  Methods: 358 families with a child who received an online autism assessment through Healios rated their satisfaction with the service from the point of referral through to when they received the diagnostic outcome.  Results: Upon entering the online assessment service, families tended to worry about the quality they expected to receive. However, after exiting the service, families held significantly higher expectations about the quality of future online autism assessments. Furthermore, families were highly satisfied throughout the entire service, except for at the point of referral.  Conclusions: Our research shows families initially expect lower quality from online autism assessments, which is contrary to their high satisfaction levels upon completion. We emphasise the need for referral services to better educate families about the quality and the benefits of online autism assessments, and provide specific recommendations about what information families would like to receive to help ease their anxieties about their child receiving an online assessment."

Methods: The sample was drawn from an Australian pregnancy cohort study and consisted of 725 women, including 230 women who met criteria for Major Depression. At 12 months postpartum, women reported on grandparental geographical proximity and hours of grandparental childcare support. Perceived grandparental support was assessed with the Postpartum Social Support Questionnaire and parenting difficulties and depressive symptoms with the Parenting Stress Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: Perceived grandparental support was related to fewer depressive symptoms among mothers with perinatal depression. In addition, higher levels of perceived grandparental support were related to lower parenting stress in mothers with and without perinatal depression. Limitations: Intergenerational conflicts and quality of grandparenting were not assessed. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that supportive grandparents may prevent the development of more severe perinatal depression in mothers experiencing perinatal mental health problems. Future studies should examine whether involving grandparents in treatment may add to the effectiveness of existing perinatal mental health interventions."

However, research has shown that families maintain a preference for face-to-face assessments. We examined families' anxieties both before and after having an online assessment to determine whether any initial concerns are due to a lack of exposure and information surrounding online assessments, as opposed to the quality of the assessment itself. We also aimed to understand how referral services can help families choose an online autism assessment for their child. Is  Methods: 358 families with a child who received an online autism assessment through Healios rated their satisfaction with the service from the point of referral through to when they received the diagnostic outcome.  Results: Upon entering the online assessment service, families tended to worry about the quality they expected to receive. However, after exiting the service, families held significantly higher expectations about the quality of future online autism assessments. Furthermore, families were highly satisfied throughout the entire service, except for at the point of referral.  Conclusions: Our research shows families initially expect lower quality from online autism assessments, which is contrary to their high satisfaction levels upon completion. We emphasise the need for referral services to better educate families about the quality and the benefits of online autism assessments, and provide specific recommendations about what information families would like to receive to help ease their anxieties about their child receiving an online assessment."

Heck, Marius Barth, Edgar Erdfelder, Nina Rebecca Arnold, Frederik Aust, Jimmy Calanchini, Fabian E. Gümüsdagli, Sebastian Horn, David Kellen","Researchers have become increasingly aware that data-analysis decisions affect results. Here, we examine this issue systematically for multinomial processing tree (MPT) models, a popular class of cognitive models for categorical data. Specifically, we examine the robustness of MPT model parameter estimates that arise from two important decisions: the level of data aggregation (complete pooling, no pooling, or partial pooling) and the statistical framework (frequentist or Bayesian). These decisions span a multiverse of estimation methods. We synthesized the data from 13,956 participants (164 published data sets) with a meta-analytic strategy and analyzed the magnitude of divergence between estimation methods for the parameters of nine popular multinomial processing tree (MPT) models in psychology (e.g., process dissociation, source monitoring). We further examined moderators as potential sources of divergence. We found that the absolute divergence between estimation methods was small on average (&lt; .04; with MPT parameters ranging between 0 and 1); in some cases, however, divergence amounted to nearly the maximum possible range (.97). Divergence was partly explained by few moderators (e.g., the specific MPT model parameter, uncertainty in parameter estimation), but not by other plausible candidate moderators (e.g., parameter trade-offs, parameter correlations) or their interactions. Partial-pooling methods showed the smallest divergence within and across levels of pooling and thus seem to be an appropriate default method. Using MPT models as an example, we show how transparency and robustness can be increased in the field of cognitive modeling."

However, most psychological research has focused on interpersonal rather than intergroup effects to understand the link between social exclusion and aggression. We compared the effects of intergroup and interpersonal using RateME, a new task designed to dissociate both types of exclusion, and Cyberball in a sample of 1200 UK residents. Intergroup exclusion elicited by RateME and interpersonal exclusion elicited by both RateME and Cyberball were independently associated with increased psychological distress and state hostility, regardless of participants’ degree of identification with the group. Exclusion of either type also increased collective narcissism, especially in participants who had experienced higher levels of psychological distress. Our work reveals similar detrimental psychological effects of intergroup exclusion compared to interpersonal exclusion, highlighting intergroup exclusion as a risk factor for mental health with potential implications for violent extremism."

Chabris, Daniel J. Simons","Overconfidence is thought to be a fundamental cognitive bias, but it is typically studied in environments where people lack accurate information about their abilities. Tournament chess players receive objective, precise, and public feedback, so we conducted a preregistered survey experiment and replication to learn whether overconfidence persists in an environment that should diminish or eradicate it. Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience. On average, participants asserted their ability was 89 Elo rating points higher than their observed ratings indicated—expecting to outscore an equally-rated opponent by 2:1. One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated. These patterns emerged in every sociodemographic subgroup we considered. We conclude that overconfidence persists even in real-world information environments that should be inhospitable to it."

The lingering effect refers to a phenomenon in which an initial misinterpretation persists in a final comprehension even after disambiguation, occurring after reading a garden-path sentence.  Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), we explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Consequently, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect while weakening the lingering effect. Additionally, the garden-path effect was affected by Surprisal, whereas the lingering effect was not. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects share a connection but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, while the lingering effect relates to short-term memory."

PD-1/PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint which involves the binding of PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) on a target cell to the PD-1 receptor (Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) on an immune cell. This immune checkpoint allows for the suppression and regulation of the immune system. Previous studies have shown that the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 allows for the activation of the immune cell and pro-inflammatory responses. However, in AD, chronic neuroinflammation has been strongly linked with the pathogenesis of the disease. The use of PD-1 inhibitors in AD is unorthodox, but not unfounded, since the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 can reduce local brain inflammation by the recruitment of immune cells for Aβ clearance, even if the immune cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors have been found to inhibit tauopathy and there is even potential in efficient combination therapies with NOD2. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis in neuroinflammation and AD is highly complex, and through this review, we aim to provide some insight into this relationship and explore the potential of it as an AD treatment."

To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences."

One such capacity is the pursuit of personal goals, which is a fundamental psychological activity for both adults and adolescents. Functional MRI studies in adults have identified patterns of BOLD activation associated with self-regulation of personal goal pursuit, but to our knowledge there are no studies to using fMRI to examine BOLD responses to personal goals in adolescence.

Their argument is based on an empirical investigation of the increase in precision to measure individual differences in change if studies are progressively extended by adding an extra measurement occasion after one unit of time (e.g., year) has passed. They concluded that two-time point models are inadequate to reliably model change at the individual level and that these models should focus on group-level effects. Here, we show that these limitations can be addressed by deconfounding the influence of study duration and the influence of adding an extra measurement occasion on precision to estimate individual differences in linear change. We use asymptotic results to gauge and compare precision of linear change models representing different study designs, and show that it is primarily the longer time span that increases precision, not the extra waves. Further, we show how the asymptotic results can be used to also consider irregularly spaced intervals as well as planned and unplanned missing data. In conclusion, we like to stress that true linear change can indeed be captured well with only two time points if careful study design planning is applied before running a study."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3wkct,2024-03-06,Curiosity and reward after unsuccessful memory recall,To be fetched,"Curiosity is a motivational state characterized by the desire to obtain knowledge through information-seeking behaviour. It is thought to depend on metacognitive assessment of the size of pertinent knowledge gaps. Prior research suggests that metacognitive retrieval experiences during unsuccessful memory recall play a role in assessing the size of knowledge gaps that induce states of curiosity. Specifically, it has been reported that feeling-of-knowing (FOK) experiences during unsuccessful recall are associated with an increased probability of subsequent information-seeking behaviour for what could not be recalled. Here, we sought further evidence for the proposed involvement of curiosity in this association by focusing on links between curiosity and reward that are integral to current theoretical models. Our experimental paradigm involved learning of novel face-name associations followed by a test phase to probe name recall and elicit graded ratings of FOK when unsuccessful. Subsequently, participants provided ratings of curiosity for unrecalled names (Experiment 1) or made information-seeking choices and offered ratings of satisfaction upon exposure to sought information (Experiment 2). Results showed, as predicted, that FOK are positively correlated with ratings of curiosity for information that could not be recalled. We also replicated previous findings demonstrating that FOK are positively correlated with the likelihood of subsequent information-seeking behaviour. Critically, the degree of satisfaction reported upon exposure to sought information was positively correlated with previously experienced FOK as well. These findings converge to support the idea that FOK experiences during unsuccessful recall induce states of curiosity and shape subsequent information-seeking behaviour through reward-based mechanisms."

University students may be particularly likely to experience climate anxiety and worry if, for example, exposed to distressing climate change content in their studies. In a pre-registered online mixed-methods study, we investigated climate anxiety, climate change-related emotions, thoughts, and views about their university’s role in climate change action among 869 students at a large UK university. Results showed that students generally experienced moderate climate anxiety intensity across different situations. Students also reported high levels of negative emotions, including sadness, helplessness, and powerlessness, and low optimism and indifference. Students also experienced moderate to high levels of negative climate change related thoughts, such as “The future is frightening”. As for their university’s role, many students wanted more climate change related teaching and mental health support for climate change impacts. On average, students endorsed the thought that their university was “Dismissing people’s distress” about climate change moderately, which correlated significantly with students’ situationally assessed climate anxiety intensity (r = .32, p &lt; .01) and general climate anxiety frequency (r = .30, p &lt; .01). These results demonstrate the serious negative impact of climate change on university students’ mental health.

By using a latent variable framework, our findings indicated that nearly all reading comprehension variance was accounted for by decoding and language comprehension across each test occasion. Both decoding and language comprehension contributed to reading comprehension at all grades. While decoding contributed the most to reading comprehension variance at the first test occasions (Grade 1), language comprehension became equally important in the middle of second grade.

The lingering effect refers to a phenomenon in which an initial misinterpretation persists in a final comprehension even after disambiguation, occurring after reading a garden-path sentence.  Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), we explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Consequently, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect while weakening the lingering effect. Additionally, the garden-path effect was affected by Surprisal, whereas the lingering effect was not. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects share a connection but operate through different underlying processes.

Interestingly, much less is known about the spatial coordinate system of suppression compared to that of facilitation. The present study examined the coordinate system of spatial suppression by manipulating gaze position and distractor regularities, asking whether suppression is coded in retinotopic (eye-centered) and/or spatiotopic (world-centered) coordinates, and if this varies with more ecological and dynamic contexts. In the current study, we demonstrate that learned spatial suppression primarily transfers across gaze position in retinotopic coordinates; however, in more dynamic contexts favoring spatiotopic information, spatial suppression can be learned in spatiotopic coordinates. These results suggest that the default coordinate system of spatial suppression is retinotopic, but suppression can be rapidly learned in spatiotopic coordinates when a spatiotopic representation is beneficial in dynamic contexts."

We tested these claims using a combination of one-stage and univariate meta-analytic structural equation modeling with moderation (k = 238; n = 1,040, N = 126,423). In the univariate models, parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being (r = 0.30 [95% CI 0.26, 0.33]) whereas parental psychological control was positively linked with child ill-being (r = 0.26 [0.23, 0.28]). Consistent with SDT’s dual process model, the one-stage model that controls for the intercorrelations between predictors, showed that parental autonomy support and psychological control had unique and independent effects on child wellness outcomes. Parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being, even when accounting for psychological control (r = 0.26 [0.20, 0.31]), and psychological control was positively linked to child ill-being, independent of autonomy support (r = 0.20 [0.17, 0.23]). Crucially, the beneficial effects of parental autonomy support and the costs of psychological control applied across regions, degrees of national individualism and cultural hierarchy, as well as child developmental periods and sexes. These results help move the field beyond debates about whether autonomy is universally beneficial, toward questions about manifestations of autonomy across groups and variations in its optimal support."

Social Identity Theory (SIT), a well-established framework used to explain (inter)group processes, has gained attraction among professionals seeking to decipher the role of social identity in the radicalization process. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive review of the makeup of such a transdisciplinary field. This paper comprehensively examines the intellectual structure, development, and emerging trends in SIT and radicalization research. This is achieved through three studies leveraging VOSviewer to conduct bibliographic coupling (Studies 1 and 2) and keyword co-occurrence analyses (Study 3) of 2,990 articles from the Web of Science database, spanning from 1970 to 2022. The findings offer an overview of the field, shedding light on influential literature and conversations, intellectual networks of countries and institutions, and provide insights on emerging areas for future research to comprehend this dynamic field. Revealing “prevention” as a trending topic within SIT and radicalization research, this paper emphasizes the contemporary efforts not only to study the foundations of this social phenomenon but also to pragmatically apply such insights to the Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE). This bibliometric analysis offers a comprehensive synthesis of knowledge essential for informed PVE interventions."

This article discusses the development of emotion research, tracing from the theoretical origin to modern AI approaches, and highlights the limitations of traditional emotion research that lead to contrasting perspectives. The emergence of AI and big data has revolutionised emotion research, leading to the development of the Semantic Space Theory, which portrays emotions as multifaceted phenomena existing in distinct categories and distributed in gradients within a high-dimensional space. Future research should integrate physiological, experiential, and behavioural data to gain comprehensive insight into emotion’s diverse dimensions and multimodal coherence using AI-driven methods. This novel framework offers a direction for a significant advancement in emotion science, aiming for a holistic understanding of human emotions."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7vtex,2024-03-05,People reward others based on their willingness to exert effort,To be fetched,"Individual contributors to a collaborative task are often rewarded for going above and beyond—salespeople earn commissions, athletes earn performance bonuses, and companies award special parking spots to their employee of the month. How do we decide when to reward collaborators, and are these decisions closely aligned with how responsible they were for the outcome of a collaboration? In Experiments 1a and 1b (𝑁 = 360), we tested how participants give bonuses, using stimuli and an experiment design that has previously been used to elicit responsibility judgments (Xiang et al., 2023a). Past work has found that responsibility judgments are driven both by how much effort people actually contributed and how much they could have contributed (Xiang et al., 2023a). In contrast, here we found that participants allocated bonuses based only on how much effort agents actually contributed. In Experiments 2a and 2b (𝑁 = 358), participants allocated bonuses to agents who were instructed to exert a particular level of effort; participants rewarded these agents more for complying with instructions, and their rewards were less sensitive to the precise level of effort exerted. Together, these findings suggest that people reward collaborators based on their willingness to exert effort, and point to a difference between decisions about how to assign responsibility to collaborators and how to incentivize them. One possible explanation for this difference is that responsibility judgments may reflect causal inference about past collaborations, whereas providing incentives may motivate collaborators to keep exerting effort in the future. Our work sheds light on how we understand and formalize the cognitive capacities that underlie collaboration."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/u3j28,2024-03-05,How preferences enslave attention: the collapse of the endogenous/exogenous distinction from an active inference perspective,To be fetched,"It is easy to think of attention as a sensory mechanism divorced from the influence of an agent’s preferences and needs. However, according to active inference, such strict divisions cannot be invoked, since all cognitive and behavioural processes can be described as maximising the evidence for an agent’s generative model, which entails preferences that make an entity the thing it is. As such, attention — and perception more broadly — is constrained or enslaved by prior beliefs for which an agent must seek evidence. This paper demonstrates that this imperative is always at play in cognitive systems endowed with attentional schema, and that the preferences in question transcend the contingent, task-relevant goals that bias attention. Rather, attention is powerfully tuned by the most-deep rooted priors the agent possesses, such that, when sensory evidence against these priors is observed and free energy spikes, the agent attentionally prioritises the homeostatic restoration of these preferred states over their shorter-term desires. Thus, at its core, attention is a goal-driven process, which calls into question the putative distinction between endogenous – goal-directed, top-down – attention and exogenous – bottom-up, stimulus-driven, automatic – attention.

Some relevant context, however, occurs after the word. Rational use of such “right context” would require listeners to have maintained uncertainty or subcategorical information about the word, thus allowing for consideration of possible alternatives when they encounter relevant right context. A classic study continues to be widely cited as evidence that subcategorical information maintenance is limited to highly ambiguous percepts and short time spans (Connine et al., 1991). More recent studies, however, using other phonological contrasts, and sometimes other paradigms, have return mixed results. We identify procedural and analytical issues that provide an explanation for existing results. We address these issues in two reanalyses of previously published results and two new experiments. In all four cases, we find consistent evidence against both limitations reported in Connine et al.’s seminal work: at least within the classic paradigms. Key to our approach is the introduction of an ideal observer framework to derive normative predictions for human word recognition expected if listeners maintain and integrate subcategorical information about preceding speech input optimally with subsequent context. We test these predictions in Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effect analyses, including at the level of individual participants."

Methods: A multidisciplinary working group of experts involved in PAT pooled formally and informally documented AEs observed through research experience and in published literature. This information was integrated with (a) current standards and practices for AE reporting in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials, and (b) published findings documenting post-acute dosing impacts of psychedelics on subjective states, meaning, and psychosocial health variables, to produce a set of AE constructs important to evaluate in PAT as well as recommended methods and time frames for their assessment and monitoring.

This behavior is commonly studied via the verbal fluency task (VFT), where participants are typically asked to generate as many exemplars as they can from a given category (e.g., animals) or letter label (e.g., F) within a fixed amount of time. Responses in the VFT tend to be clustered in meaningful ways but individuals widely differ in the manner in which they cluster items. Despite the development of several (hand-coded and automated) methods of defining clusters and switches in the VFT, there is currently no consensus on which scoring method provides the best mechanistic account of how individuals search through memory in the VFT. In this work, we provide an empirical evaluation of several automated methods for defining clusters and switches in the VFT by comparing model-predicted clusters with participant-designated clusters. We find that a method that combines gradual rises and drops in a weighted composite of semantic and phonological similarity best predicts participant-designated cluster-switch events across three domains (animals, foods, and occupations). Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to understand idiosyncratic search behavior by computing a measure of discordance for each pairwise transition based on a large dataset of cluster-switch designations from independent raters (N = 211) for the same transitions via a pre-registered experiment.

This article discusses the development of emotion research, tracing from the theoretical origin to modern AI approaches, and highlights the limitations of traditional emotion research that lead to contrasting perspectives. The emergence of AI and big data has revolutionised emotion research, leading to the development of the Semantic Space Theory, which portrays emotions as multifaceted phenomena existing in distinct categories and distributed in gradients within a high-dimensional space. Future research should integrate physiological, experiential, and behavioural data to gain comprehensive insight into emotion’s diverse dimensions and multimodal coherence using AI-driven methods. This novel framework offers a direction for a significant advancement in emotion science, aiming for a holistic understanding of human emotions."

However, according to active inference, such strict divisions cannot be invoked, since all cognitive and behavioural processes can be described as maximising the evidence for an agent’s generative model, which entails preferences that make an entity the thing it is. As such, attention — and perception more broadly — is constrained or enslaved by prior beliefs for which an agent must seek evidence. This paper demonstrates that this imperative is always at play in cognitive systems endowed with attentional schema, and that the preferences in question transcend the contingent, task-relevant goals that bias attention. Rather, attention is powerfully tuned by the most-deep rooted priors the agent possesses, such that, when sensory evidence against these priors is observed and free energy spikes, the agent attentionally prioritises the homeostatic restoration of these preferred states over their shorter-term desires. Thus, at its core, attention is a goal-driven process, which calls into question the putative distinction between endogenous – goal-directed, top-down – attention and exogenous – bottom-up, stimulus-driven, automatic – attention. What emerges in its place is a symbiotic relationship between attention and preferences, whereby the fulfilment of the latter rests on successful application of the former, and the former derives its function from the organismic need to confirm the latter."

Gershman","Individual contributors to a collaborative task are often rewarded for going above and beyond—salespeople earn commissions, athletes earn performance bonuses, and companies award special parking spots to their employee of the month. How do we decide when to reward collaborators, and are these decisions closely aligned with how responsible they were for the outcome of a collaboration? In Experiments 1a and 1b (𝑁 = 360), we tested how participants give bonuses, using stimuli and an experiment design that has previously been used to elicit responsibility judgments (Xiang et al., 2023a). Past work has found that responsibility judgments are driven both by how much effort people actually contributed and how much they could have contributed (Xiang et al., 2023a). In contrast, here we found that participants allocated bonuses based only on how much effort agents actually contributed. In Experiments 2a and 2b (𝑁 = 358), participants allocated bonuses to agents who were instructed to exert a particular level of effort; participants rewarded these agents more for complying with instructions, and their rewards were less sensitive to the precise level of effort exerted. Together, these findings suggest that people reward collaborators based on their willingness to exert effort, and point to a difference between decisions about how to assign responsibility to collaborators and how to incentivize them. One possible explanation for this difference is that responsibility judgments may reflect causal inference about past collaborations, whereas providing incentives may motivate collaborators to keep exerting effort in the future. Our work sheds light on how we understand and formalize the cognitive capacities that underlie collaboration."

Prior work has hinted that these individuals may experience qualitative alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) in contrast to neurotypicals. However, higher levels of alexithymia (i.e., difficulties identifying one’s own emotions) and trauma exposure have been linked to PTSD and possibly aphantasia. We therefore wondered if aphantasia would be associated with the most widely used PTSD symptom measures (i.e., the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: PCL-5; and the International Trauma Questionnaire: ITQ) when alexithymia, trauma levels, sex at birth and age were considered. We replicated prior work in finding alexithymia positively predicts symptoms across all PTSD and complex PTSD measures, their subscales, and their related functional impairments. By contrast, aphantasia was not clearly linked to PTSD symptoms in global PCL-5 or ITQ scores, nor in any of the PCL-5 subscales. Despite this, aphantasia was associated with a reduction in the ITQ’s re-experiencing of traumatic events subscale, and an increase in complex PTSD symptoms, i.e., disturbances in self-organization and its related functional impairments, negative self-concepts, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Given their elevated levels of complex PTSD symptoms, those with aphantasia may require greater support than is currently considered. Moreover, these findings support suggestions that the disturbances in self-organisation associated with complex PTSD may be partially distinct from the core symptoms of PTSD."

A coherent percept of our body relies upon the smooth integration of different senses, such as vision and touch, which are processed by the brain at different speeds. In a N=100 non-clinical sample, we used Virtual Reality to investigate sensory-integration by systematically lengthening a delay to an immersive visual feed on a head-mounted display, resulting in visual information being delayed relative to other senses (e.g. touch). Larger delays were associated with self-reported feelings of dis-ownership from the body, and participants with high trait dissociation were more sensitive to delay, suggesting an increased tendency to ‘fraction’ senses. Moreover, individuals with higher dissociation displayed similar cardiac reactivity to both self and other touch. These findings highlight two key mechanisms underlying dissociation; altered sensory-integration and distinct processing of self and other touch."

This could be attributed to the observer’s general unfamiliarity with the dynamic characteristics of the movement after the inversion. A previous study showed that, compared to typical and non-dancers, vertical dancers were more sensitive to the artificial inversion of dance movements performed either in an upright or inverted orientation, when provided with dynamic information. This ability was attributed to vertical dancers’ unique visual and motor experience of performing movements upside down while hanging in the air. The current study aimed to replicate this finding and use eye-tracking data to identify the source of information that vertical dancers relied on to perform the judgment. Twenty dance movements were recorded either on the ground or in the air. Each pair of ground and air movements had similar forms to control the configural information. The movement was either presented as-is or inverted and the participants needed to determine whether the display was inverted. The results replicated the previous study and further showed that the higher sensitivity of vertical dancers in detecting the inverted movements was attributed to their longer and more frequent fixations on the lower torso area, where the harness was placed when performing the air movement. Although traditional dancers also attended to the lower torso area, their lack of experience with inverted movements limited their ability to interpret the observed motion for detection of the inversion."

However, despite its prevalence, no theory of ADHD exists which explains the behavioural processes behind its common symptoms, holistically accounts for contextual considerations, or explains cases where people with ADHD perform better than their neurotypical peers. In this paper, we extend current process theories of self-control and self-regulation to clinical self-regulation issues within ADHD. ADHD behaviour is characterised as a faster change in goal-directed behaviour over time and tasks, and dependent on an individual’s context. We use this model to explain both basic and complex ADHD symptoms and differentiate this behavioural process from sluggish cognitive tempo, which also contributes to inattentive symptoms through a different behavioural process. We then make contextual treatment recommendations based on our behavioural model and underlying theory of behaviour. Future research is needed to test the generalisability of goal-directed behaviour processes from neurotypical to ADHD populations across different contexts."

While previous research has primarily focused on IU and paranoia separately, there is recent evidence to suggest that IU and paranoia are linked and may interact to increase risk for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia-spectrum conditions. The aims of the current study were to assess: (1) the extent to which IU (total score and subscales), paranoia, anxiety, and depression are associated and (2) whether the interaction between IU and paranoia is associated with greater anxiety and depression symptoms. To examine these aims, we conducted a survey on an international multi-site sample (n = 2510). Questionnaires included: IU (total score and subscales), paranoia (RGPTS persecution subscale), anxiety, and depression.  The findings revealed that: (1) IU was positively associated with paranoia (r = .43), anxiety (r = .48) and depression (r = .49), and (2) People with high scores on IU and paranoia showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Importantly, these effects remained when controlling for negative beliefs about the self and others and demographic factors. Additionally, the inhibitory IU subscale (uncertainty paralysis) was related to paranoia, anxiety, and depression. However, the prospective IU subscale (desire for predictability) was only related to anxiety, but not paranoia and depression. Overall, these findings reliably demonstrate that IU and paranoia are linked, and that IU and paranoia interactions may synergistically work to affect current levels of anxiety and depression symptoms."

Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ve6ca,2024-03-05,Reduced Spatial Frequency Differentiation and Sex Differences in the Fusiform Cortex during Emotional Face Processing in Autism,To be fetched,"Background: Visual perception relies on predictive processes driven by low spatial frequencies that convey coarse information prior to fine information conveyed by high frequencies. Autistic individuals, however, favor local and fine information, conveyed by high spatial frequencies. This suggests that atypical predictive processes from low spatial frequencies may contribute to facial processing difficulties in autism. Nonetheless, since autistic females often present better socio-communicational abilities than males, we hypothesized that a more typical coarse-to-fine processing should be seen in autistic females than males for socioemotional stimuli. Method: To test this hypothesis, we asked adult participants (44 autistic, 51 non-autistic) to detect fearful faces among neutral faces, filtered in two orders: from coarse to fine (CtF) and from fine to coarse (FtC). Results: Results show lower d’ values and longer reaction times for fearful detection in autism compared to non-autistic individuals, irrespective of the filtering order. Both groups presented shorter P100 latency after CtF compared to FtC, and faster and larger amplitude for N170 after FtC compared to CtF. Nevertheless, autistic participants presented reduced differences between CtF and FtC in the fusiform, which was more spatially spread in autistic females compared to NA females. This suggests reduced spatial frequency differentiation in autism. Finally, females had faster P100 and N170, and larger occipital activation for FtC sequences than males, regardless of the group. Conclusions: The results do not suggest impaired predictive processes from LSF in autism despite behavioral differences in fear detection. Nonetheless, they indicate sex differences that need to be considered."

Social Identity Theory (SIT), a well-established framework used to explain (inter)group processes, has gained attraction among professionals seeking to decipher the role of social identity in the radicalization process. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive review of the makeup of such a transdisciplinary field. This paper comprehensively examines the intellectual structure, development, and emerging trends in SIT and radicalization research. This is achieved through three studies leveraging VOSviewer to conduct bibliographic coupling (Studies 1 and 2) and keyword co-occurrence analyses (Study 3) of 2,990 articles from the Web of Science database, spanning from 1970 to 2022. The findings offer an overview of the field, shedding light on influential literature and conversations, intellectual networks of countries and institutions, and provide insights on emerging areas for future research to comprehend this dynamic field. Revealing “prevention” as a trending topic within SIT and radicalization research, this paper emphasizes the contemporary efforts not only to study the foundations of this social phenomenon but also to pragmatically apply such insights to the Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE). This bibliometric analysis offers a comprehensive synthesis of knowledge essential for informed PVE interventions."

Interestingly, much less is known about the spatial coordinate system of suppression compared to that of facilitation. The present study examined the coordinate system of spatial suppression by manipulating gaze position and distractor regularities, asking whether suppression is coded in retinotopic (eye-centered) and/or spatiotopic (world-centered) coordinates, and if this varies with more ecological and dynamic contexts. In the current study, we demonstrate that learned spatial suppression primarily transfers across gaze position in retinotopic coordinates; however, in more dynamic contexts favoring spatiotopic information, spatial suppression can be learned in spatiotopic coordinates. These results suggest that the default coordinate system of spatial suppression is retinotopic, but suppression can be rapidly learned in spatiotopic coordinates when a spatiotopic representation is beneficial in dynamic contexts."

Conigrave, Ben Steward, Kelly Ferber, Mireille Joussemet, Philip Parker, Richard M. Ryan","Self-determination theory’s (SDT) dual process model maintains that parental autonomy support relates positively to child well-being, while psychologically controlling parenting is linked positively to child ill-being. We tested these claims using a combination of one-stage and univariate meta-analytic structural equation modeling with moderation (k = 238; n = 1,040, N = 126,423). In the univariate models, parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being (r = 0.30 [95% CI 0.26, 0.33]) whereas parental psychological control was positively linked with child ill-being (r = 0.26 [0.23, 0.28]). Consistent with SDT’s dual process model, the one-stage model that controls for the intercorrelations between predictors, showed that parental autonomy support and psychological control had unique and independent effects on child wellness outcomes. Parental autonomy support linked positively with child well-being, even when accounting for psychological control (r = 0.26 [0.20, 0.31]), and psychological control was positively linked to child ill-being, independent of autonomy support (r = 0.20 [0.17, 0.23]). Crucially, the beneficial effects of parental autonomy support and the costs of psychological control applied across regions, degrees of national individualism and cultural hierarchy, as well as child developmental periods and sexes. These results help move the field beyond debates about whether autonomy is universally beneficial, toward questions about manifestations of autonomy across groups and variations in its optimal support."

Sharpe","ADHD is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with people with the disorder representing one extreme of self-regulation within any population. However, despite its prevalence, no theory of ADHD exists which explains the behavioural processes behind its common symptoms, holistically accounts for contextual considerations, or explains cases where people with ADHD perform better than their neurotypical peers. In this paper, we extend current process theories of self-control and self-regulation to clinical self-regulation issues within ADHD. ADHD behaviour is characterised as a faster change in goal-directed behaviour over time and tasks, and dependent on an individual’s context. We use this model to explain both basic and complex ADHD symptoms and differentiate this behavioural process from sluggish cognitive tempo, which also contributes to inattentive symptoms through a different behavioural process. We then make contextual treatment recommendations based on our behavioural model and underlying theory of behaviour. Future research is needed to test the generalisability of goal-directed behaviour processes from neurotypical to ADHD populations across different contexts."

Klein, Constantin von Stackelberg, Esther K. Papies, Lawrence Barsalou","Climate change increasingly affects mental health and wellbeing. Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support."

J. Morris, Lyn Ellett","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU: the tendency to find uncertainty aversive) and paranoia (e.g., excessive mistrust of others), are both associated with anxiety and depression symptoms.  While previous research has primarily focused on IU and paranoia separately, there is recent evidence to suggest that IU and paranoia are linked and may interact to increase risk for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia-spectrum conditions. The aims of the current study were to assess: (1) the extent to which IU (total score and subscales), paranoia, anxiety, and depression are associated and (2) whether the interaction between IU and paranoia is associated with greater anxiety and depression symptoms. To examine these aims, we conducted a survey on an international multi-site sample (n = 2510). Questionnaires included: IU (total score and subscales), paranoia (RGPTS persecution subscale), anxiety, and depression.  The findings revealed that: (1) IU was positively associated with paranoia (r = .43), anxiety (r = .48) and depression (r = .49), and (2) People with high scores on IU and paranoia showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Importantly, these effects remained when controlling for negative beliefs about the self and others and demographic factors. Additionally, the inhibitory IU subscale (uncertainty paralysis) was related to paranoia, anxiety, and depression. However, the prospective IU subscale (desire for predictability) was only related to anxiety, but not paranoia and depression. Overall, these findings reliably demonstrate that IU and paranoia are linked, and that IU and paranoia interactions may synergistically work to affect current levels of anxiety and depression symptoms."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kj5d3,2024-03-05,Aphantasia and alexithymia predict complex PTSD symptoms,"Emmanual Ale, Edwin Burns","Aphantasia is characterised by a complete, or almost complete, absence of visual imagery. Prior work has hinted that these individuals may experience qualitative alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) in contrast to neurotypicals. However, higher levels of alexithymia (i.e., difficulties identifying one’s own emotions) and trauma exposure have been linked to PTSD and possibly aphantasia. We therefore wondered if aphantasia would be associated with the most widely used PTSD symptom measures (i.e., the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: PCL-5; and the International Trauma Questionnaire: ITQ) when alexithymia, trauma levels, sex at birth and age were considered. We replicated prior work in finding alexithymia positively predicts symptoms across all PTSD and complex PTSD measures, their subscales, and their related functional impairments. By contrast, aphantasia was not clearly linked to PTSD symptoms in global PCL-5 or ITQ scores, nor in any of the PCL-5 subscales. Despite this, aphantasia was associated with a reduction in the ITQ’s re-experiencing of traumatic events subscale, and an increase in complex PTSD symptoms, i.e., disturbances in self-organization and its related functional impairments, negative self-concepts, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Given their elevated levels of complex PTSD symptoms, those with aphantasia may require greater support than is currently considered. Moreover, these findings support suggestions that the disturbances in self-organisation associated with complex PTSD may be partially distinct from the core symptoms of PTSD."

Wilson, Qin Zhu","The inversion effect of biological motion suggests that presenting a point-light display in an inverted orientation would affect the observer’s ability to perceive the movement. This could be attributed to the observer’s general unfamiliarity with the dynamic characteristics of the movement after the inversion. A previous study showed that, compared to typical and non-dancers, vertical dancers were more sensitive to the artificial inversion of dance movements performed either in an upright or inverted orientation, when provided with dynamic information. This ability was attributed to vertical dancers’ unique visual and motor experience of performing movements upside down while hanging in the air. The current study aimed to replicate this finding and use eye-tracking data to identify the source of information that vertical dancers relied on to perform the judgment. Twenty dance movements were recorded either on the ground or in the air. Each pair of ground and air movements had similar forms to control the configural information. The movement was either presented as-is or inverted and the participants needed to determine whether the display was inverted. The results replicated the previous study and further showed that the higher sensitivity of vertical dancers in detecting the inverted movements was attributed to their longer and more frequent fixations on the lower torso area, where the harness was placed when performing the air movement. Although traditional dancers also attended to the lower torso area, their lack of experience with inverted movements limited their ability to interpret the observed motion for detection of the inversion."

Autistic individuals, however, favor local and fine information, conveyed by high spatial frequencies. This suggests that atypical predictive processes from low spatial frequencies may contribute to facial processing difficulties in autism. Nonetheless, since autistic females often present better socio-communicational abilities than males, we hypothesized that a more typical coarse-to-fine processing should be seen in autistic females than males for socioemotional stimuli. Method: To test this hypothesis, we asked adult participants (44 autistic, 51 non-autistic) to detect fearful faces among neutral faces, filtered in two orders: from coarse to fine (CtF) and from fine to coarse (FtC). Results: Results show lower d’ values and longer reaction times for fearful detection in autism compared to non-autistic individuals, irrespective of the filtering order. Both groups presented shorter P100 latency after CtF compared to FtC, and faster and larger amplitude for N170 after FtC compared to CtF. Nevertheless, autistic participants presented reduced differences between CtF and FtC in the fusiform, which was more spatially spread in autistic females compared to NA females. This suggests reduced spatial frequency differentiation in autism. Finally, females had faster P100 and N170, and larger occipital activation for FtC sequences than males, regardless of the group. Conclusions: The results do not suggest impaired predictive processes from LSF in autism despite behavioral differences in fear detection. Nonetheless, they indicate sex differences that need to be considered."

A coherent percept of our body relies upon the smooth integration of different senses, such as vision and touch, which are processed by the brain at different speeds. In a N=100 non-clinical sample, we used Virtual Reality to investigate sensory-integration by systematically lengthening a delay to an immersive visual feed on a head-mounted display, resulting in visual information being delayed relative to other senses (e.g. touch). Larger delays were associated with self-reported feelings of dis-ownership from the body, and participants with high trait dissociation were more sensitive to delay, suggesting an increased tendency to ‘fraction’ senses. Moreover, individuals with higher dissociation displayed similar cardiac reactivity to both self and other touch. These findings highlight two key mechanisms underlying dissociation; altered sensory-integration and distinct processing of self and other touch."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/grkya,2024-03-05,Measurement and sampling noise undermine inferences about awareness in location probability learning: A modeling approach,To be fetched,"Occasionally, experimental psychologists enter into the realm of psychometrics without being fully aware of the risks involved in the study of individual differences. Here we re-assess the many studies on location probability learning that suggest that people can unconsciously learn to suppress salient but irrelevant distractors frequently presented in a certain location. In the additional singleton task, one of the arguments to support this claim is that suppression in search times does not significantly differ between “aware” and “unaware” participants. Although rarely acknowledged, this null interaction could also result if the data are contaminated by measurement and/or sampling noise. Unfortunately, the reliability of the awareness measure cannot be assessed with standard methods, since it is a single-trial test. In the present study we offer model-based estimations of measurement and sampling noise in empirical data. Our goal is to determine how often researchers would mistakenly conclude that learning is unconscious, given data from a model based on the opposite claim (i.e., that learning is conscious) but including noise in participants’ search times and awareness responses. To do so, we fitted this noisy conscious model to a public dataset involving 159 participants who performed the additional singleton task. Estimated parameters from this model were used, first, to predict the observed pattern of results and, second, to simulate new responses and participants. Results suggest that, under reasonable measurement noise and sample sizes, simulated evidence from the model can paradoxically but falsely support arguments used to defend the unconscious learning hypothesis. This study serves as an illustration to experimental psychologists of the risks of neglecting basic psychometric requirements in individual differences research."

This individualistic focus neglects the role of collective behavioral and emotional responses in mitigating disease spread. To address this, we introduce a two-layer framework of the BIS, consisting of an individual layer driven by disgust, primarily manifesting in avoidance behaviors and biased attitudes, and a collective layer fueled by collective anxiety, characterized by isolation from outgroups and self-protection within ingroups. Our model shows that inadequacies in the individual-level BIS stimulate the emergence of a collective-level BIS, which in turn has a buffering effect on individual behaviors. We further explore the impact of social relation attributes on the collective-level BIS, categorizing them into fixed and flowing types based on selectivity and expected endpoints, finding that flowing relations prompt collective BIS responses through cooperation, while fixed relations do so through intimate relationships. This enriched framework offers important implications for public health policies and opens avenues for cross-cultural and cross-societal research by acknowledging the reciprocal influences between individual and collective behaviors in response to pathogen threats."

Apports de la psychologie clinique et sociale à la question du leadership de  proximité à l’hôpital public,To be fetched,"Nous avançons dans cet article une contribution théorique originale croisant les apports de la psychologie clinique et de la psychologie sociale, afin de proposer une conceptualisation différente du leadership exercé par les cadres de santé à l’hôpital. Nos développements s’appuient sur un côtoiement au long cours de cadres de santé en formation ou en exercice, d’abord durant une enquête de terrain ethnographique avec entretiens semi-dirigés, puis grâce à plusieurs années de participation observante en tant qu’enseignants dans des formations en Instituts de Formation de Cadres de Santé. A partir de la question toujours plus sensible à l’hôpital de la prise en compte des difficultés propres aux cadres de santé, nous ouvrons dans un premier temps des pistes de compréhension des tensions psychiques que ces professionnels rencontrent. Tout d’abord, leur statut tiraillé entre identité soignante et identité managériale, et les injonctions parfois fortes à choisir entre les deux, peuvent amener les cadres à ressentir la nécessité d’être pour leurs équipes des « pivots » entre ces deux mondes. Si leur sentiment d’utilité sociale y gagne, la charge mentale afférente à ce rôle social qu’ils endossent augmente elle aussi, les équipes pouvant être tentées de déléguer des parties du travail collectif à la seule figure du cadre. Nous avons proposé que les situations dans lesquelles les cadres ressentiraient la nécessité d’endosser l’ensemble du « cadre » pour que leur service tienne relèveraient de moment de confusion entre « fonction du cadre » et « fonction-cadre », la première relevant des missions du cadre tandis que la seconde, en se référant à la psychologie clinique, peut être définie comme une fonction institutionnelle reposant sur de multiples paramètres garantissant la stabilité matérielle, relationnelle et symbolique suffisante d’un service. A partir des théories élaborées en psychologie sociale sur le « leadership partagé » et la « théorie de l’identité sociale », nous proposons des pistes pour penser l’activité concrète du cadre. Nous distinguons de trois registres : celui de la fonction-cadre, celui de la fonction du cadre et celui de la construction d’un sentiment d’identité partagé, qui sous-tend l’ensemble des actes et paroles du cadre. A rebours des injonctions au « deuil du soin » pour exercer des fonctions managériales, nous proposerons que le cadre gagne à rester proche de son identification première de soignant afin de bénéficier du soutien social de son équipe en tant que membre du groupe soignant à part entière, et que la répartition des tâches dans les services n’impute pas l’ensemble de la gestion des paramètres du cadre institutionnel à la personne du cadre de santé."

To dissect the causal dynamics underpinning this belief, numerous paradigms have been devised. Yet, these interventions often yield marginal and nonspecific effects in free will belief. This study aims to pioneer a novel approach, employing illusionism-based approach, to manipulate free will belief and examine its downstream effects on social behaviors. In our initial exploration, we utilized an illusionist technique, transcending mere magic tricks, to cultivate or diminish free will belief among participants, aligning them with pro- or anti-free will stances, respectively. This intervention demonstrated a moderate, yet targeted, impact on the belief in free will, distinctively affecting it without spilling over to associated beliefs like determinism and dualism. A subsequent experiment sought to validate these effects and probe their potential influence on social bias, particularly the fundamental attribution error. Results echoed the manipulation's consistent sway on free will belief, albeit without extending to influence the fundamental attribution error. Collectively, our findings illuminate the capacity of illusionism to finely tune free will belief, albeit revealing scant evidence for a direct conduit from such beliefs to social behavior patterns."

HOT suggests that consciousness emerges from meta-representations, which are representations of first-order sensory representations. However, translating this abstract concept into a concrete computational model, such as those used in artificial intelligence, presents a theoretical challenge. For example, a simplistic interpretation of meta-representation as a representation of representation makes the notion rather trivial and ubiquitous. Here, we propose a refined interpretation of meta-representations. Contrary to the simplistic view of meta-representations as mere transformations of the first-order representational states or confidence estimates, we argue that meta-representations are representations of the processes that generate first-order representations. This presents a process-oriented view whereby meta-representations capture the qualitative aspect of how sensory information is transformed into first-order representations. To concretely illustrate and operationalize thus formulated notion of meta-representation, we constructed ""meta-networks"" designed to explicitly model meta-representations within deep learning architectures. Specifically, we constructed meta-networks by implementing autoencoders of first-order neural networks. In this architecture, the latent spaces embedding those first-order networks correspond to the meta-representations of first-order networks. By applying meta-networks to embed neural networks trained to encode visual and auditory datasets, we show that the meta-representations of first-order networks successfully capture the qualitative aspects of those networks by separating the visual and auditory networks in the meta-representation space. We argue that such meta-representations would be useful for quantitatively compare and contrast the qualitative differences of computational processes. While whether such meta-representational systems exist in the human brain remains an open question, this formulation of meta-representation offers a new empirically testable hypothesis that there are brain regions that represent the processes of transforming a representation in one brain region to a representation in another brain region.

Apports de la psychologie clinique et sociale à la question du leadership de  proximité à l’hôpital public,"Héloise Haliday, Fabrice Gabarrot","Nous avançons dans cet article une contribution théorique originale croisant les apports de la psychologie clinique et de la psychologie sociale, afin de proposer une conceptualisation différente du leadership exercé par les cadres de santé à l’hôpital. Nos développements s’appuient sur un côtoiement au long cours de cadres de santé en formation ou en exercice, d’abord durant une enquête de terrain ethnographique avec entretiens semi-dirigés, puis grâce à plusieurs années de participation observante en tant qu’enseignants dans des formations en Instituts de Formation de Cadres de Santé. A partir de la question toujours plus sensible à l’hôpital de la prise en compte des difficultés propres aux cadres de santé, nous ouvrons dans un premier temps des pistes de compréhension des tensions psychiques que ces professionnels rencontrent. Tout d’abord, leur statut tiraillé entre identité soignante et identité managériale, et les injonctions parfois fortes à choisir entre les deux, peuvent amener les cadres à ressentir la nécessité d’être pour leurs équipes des « pivots » entre ces deux mondes. Si leur sentiment d’utilité sociale y gagne, la charge mentale afférente à ce rôle social qu’ils endossent augmente elle aussi, les équipes pouvant être tentées de déléguer des parties du travail collectif à la seule figure du cadre. Nous avons proposé que les situations dans lesquelles les cadres ressentiraient la nécessité d’endosser l’ensemble du « cadre » pour que leur service tienne relèveraient de moment de confusion entre « fonction du cadre » et « fonction-cadre », la première relevant des missions du cadre tandis que la seconde, en se référant à la psychologie clinique, peut être définie comme une fonction institutionnelle reposant sur de multiples paramètres garantissant la stabilité matérielle, relationnelle et symbolique suffisante d’un service. A partir des théories élaborées en psychologie sociale sur le « leadership partagé » et la « théorie de l’identité sociale », nous proposons des pistes pour penser l’activité concrète du cadre. Nous distinguons de trois registres : celui de la fonction-cadre, celui de la fonction du cadre et celui de la construction d’un sentiment d’identité partagé, qui sous-tend l’ensemble des actes et paroles du cadre. A rebours des injonctions au « deuil du soin » pour exercer des fonctions managériales, nous proposerons que le cadre gagne à rester proche de son identification première de soignant afin de bénéficier du soutien social de son équipe en tant que membre du groupe soignant à part entière, et que la répartition des tâches dans les services n’impute pas l’ensemble de la gestion des paramètres du cadre institutionnel à la personne du cadre de santé."

One key aspect of immigrant children's experience is navigating multiple languages, creating both opportunities, and challenges. However, the literature on bilingualism rarely centers the experiences of immigrant children. Focusing on immigrant children in the United States, this article brings together cognitive science research on bilingualism with the integrative risk and resilience model of adaptation in immigrant-origin children to elucidate how common contexts that immigrant children encounter can support or discourage multilingualism. Policy must consider immigrant children's intersecting identities—both as immigrants and as learners of minoritized, and often racialized, languages. A proposed framework can guide policies to support multilingualism in immigrant children, with downstream consequences for their health and development."

To dissect the causal dynamics underpinning this belief, numerous paradigms have been devised. Yet, these interventions often yield marginal and nonspecific effects in free will belief. This study aims to pioneer a novel approach, employing illusionism-based approach, to manipulate free will belief and examine its downstream effects on social behaviors. In our initial exploration, we utilized an illusionist technique, transcending mere magic tricks, to cultivate or diminish free will belief among participants, aligning them with pro- or anti-free will stances, respectively. This intervention demonstrated a moderate, yet targeted, impact on the belief in free will, distinctively affecting it without spilling over to associated beliefs like determinism and dualism. A subsequent experiment sought to validate these effects and probe their potential influence on social bias, particularly the fundamental attribution error. Results echoed the manipulation's consistent sway on free will belief, albeit without extending to influence the fundamental attribution error. Collectively, our findings illuminate the capacity of illusionism to finely tune free will belief, albeit revealing scant evidence for a direct conduit from such beliefs to social behavior patterns."

This individualistic focus neglects the role of collective behavioral and emotional responses in mitigating disease spread. To address this, we introduce a two-layer framework of the BIS, consisting of an individual layer driven by disgust, primarily manifesting in avoidance behaviors and biased attitudes, and a collective layer fueled by collective anxiety, characterized by isolation from outgroups and self-protection within ingroups. Our model shows that inadequacies in the individual-level BIS stimulate the emergence of a collective-level BIS, which in turn has a buffering effect on individual behaviors. We further explore the impact of social relation attributes on the collective-level BIS, categorizing them into fixed and flowing types based on selectivity and expected endpoints, finding that flowing relations prompt collective BIS responses through cooperation, while fixed relations do so through intimate relationships. This enriched framework offers important implications for public health policies and opens avenues for cross-cultural and cross-societal research by acknowledging the reciprocal influences between individual and collective behaviors in response to pathogen threats."

Vadillo","Occasionally, experimental psychologists enter into the realm of psychometrics without being fully aware of the risks involved in the study of individual differences. Here we re-assess the many studies on location probability learning that suggest that people can unconsciously learn to suppress salient but irrelevant distractors frequently presented in a certain location. In the additional singleton task, one of the arguments to support this claim is that suppression in search times does not significantly differ between “aware” and “unaware” participants. Although rarely acknowledged, this null interaction could also result if the data are contaminated by measurement and/or sampling noise. Unfortunately, the reliability of the awareness measure cannot be assessed with standard methods, since it is a single-trial test. In the present study we offer model-based estimations of measurement and sampling noise in empirical data. Our goal is to determine how often researchers would mistakenly conclude that learning is unconscious, given data from a model based on the opposite claim (i.e., that learning is conscious) but including noise in participants’ search times and awareness responses. To do so, we fitted this noisy conscious model to a public dataset involving 159 participants who performed the additional singleton task. Estimated parameters from this model were used, first, to predict the observed pattern of results and, second, to simulate new responses and participants. Results suggest that, under reasonable measurement noise and sample sizes, simulated evidence from the model can paradoxically but falsely support arguments used to defend the unconscious learning hypothesis. This study serves as an illustration to experimental psychologists of the risks of neglecting basic psychometric requirements in individual differences research."

Ex-ante honesty oaths—commitments to honesty before action—have been proposed as useful interventions to counteract dishonest behavior, but the heterogeneity in findings across operationalizations calls their effectiveness into question. We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)—proposed, evaluated, and selected by 44 expert researchers—and a no-oath condition in a megastudy in which 21,506 UK and US participants played an incentivized tax evasion game. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, but experts’ predictions were more accurate. In conclusion, honesty oaths can be effective in curbing dishonesty but their effectiveness varies depending on content. These findings can help design impactful interventions to curb dishonesty."

Structured mindfulness based interventions such as Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) have been shown to be at least as effective as other interventions for treating anxiety, but a thorough analysis of different factors for effective treatments is missing.   Objective The objective of this narrative synthesis is to synthesize mindfulness treatments for anxiety in young adults aged between 12 to 25, and examine components of those interventions that are more effective in reducing anxiety.   Methods Studies were selected from 3 public databases (APA Psycinfo, Embase, Medline), as well as a manual process to augment the searches. Interventions involving Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness based Stress Reduction (MBSR) based studies, as well as their variants were eligible. Anxiety should be one of the measures in the study although it may not be the primary measure. After initial screening and removal of duplicates, 8 studies involving 423 participants were identified.   Results Identified themes included customizations for young people, homework and follow ups, qualifications of the instructors, dropout rates, physical activity and subjective experience. Most studies showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, in case of social phobia, chronic pain, stress and academic performance. However, variable scales for measuring anxiety were employed across studies, making it difficult to combine or compare them. The amount of improvement of anxiety was variable. Interventions that included mindfulness information sessions for parents and interventions with mindful physical activity such as yoga showed better results.   Conclusion Recommendations are presented to enable more effective mindfulness interventions tailored for young people with anxiety."

In most cases, GMMs are based on scores from item responses collected using survey scales or other measures. Research already shows that GMMs can be sensitive to departures from ideal modeling conditions, and that growth model results outside of GMMs are sensitive to decisions about how item responses are scored, but the impact of scoring decisions on GMMs has never been investigated. We start to close that gap in the literature with the current study. Through empirical and Monte Carlo studies, we show that GMM results—including convergence, class enumeration, and latent growth trajectories within class—are extremely sensitive to seemingly arcane measurement decisions. Further, our results make clear that, because GMM latent classes are not known a priori, measurement models used to produce scores for use in GMMs are, almost by definition, misspecified because they cannot account for group membership. Misspecification of the measurement model then, in turn, biases GMM results. Practical implications of these results are discussed. Our findings raise serious concerns that many results in the current GMM literature may be driven, in part or whole, by measurement artifacts rather than substantive differences in developmental trends."

This study tested the effectiveness of web-based CBM-I relative to an active psychoeducation condition and the addition of low-intensity telecoaching for a subset of CBM-I participants. Method: 1,234 anxious community adults (M_age = 35.09 years, 81.2% female, 72.1% white, 82.6% not Hispanic) were randomly assigned at Stage 1 of a sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial to complete five weekly sessions of CBM-I or psychoeducation on our team’s public research website. After the first session, for Stage 2, an algorithm attempted to classify CBM-I participants as higher (vs. lower) risk for dropping out; those classified as higher risk were then randomly assigned to complete four brief weekly telecoaching check-ins (vs. no coaching). Results: As hypothesized (https://doi.org/j2xr; Daniel, Eberle, &amp; Teachman, 2020), CBM-I significantly outperformed psychoeducation at improving positive and negative interpretation biases (Recognition Ratings, Brief Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire) and anxiety symptoms (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, Anxiety Scale from Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–Short Form), with smaller treatment gains remaining significant at 2-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, CBM-I had significantly worse treatment dropout outcomes than psychoeducation, and adding coaching (vs. no coaching) did not significantly improve efficacy or dropout outcomes (notably, many participants chose not to interact with their coach). Conclusions: Web-based CBM-I appears effective, but supplemental coaching may not mitigate the challenge of dropout."

With recent evidence indicating harmful effects of microplastic exposure to human and natural systems, we tested based on Rogers’ Protection Motivation Theory whether planetary health framing, which is considered a promising tool for climate change communication, is suitable for raising concerns about the issue. Following a mixed-methods design, we employed a  2 x 2 between-subjects vignette experiment (N = 898) to explore the connection between planetary health framing and one’s intention to participate politically across different levels of psychological distance, while strengthening the understanding of the behavior itself. Therefore, we subjected 1,992 open-text responses to a qualitative analysis assessing which dimensions of political participation are considered relevant, and what obstacles populate the gap between intention to participate and actual participation.  The experimental data shows that varying the planetary health condition does not result in significant differences, whereas distance framing showed an inversed effect pattern contrary to what our hypotheses expected. This highlights the urgent need for further research on planetary health as a framing subject. The qualitative findings on behavior dimensions provide an enriched proposal for adapting existing instruments to measure political participation in a variety of public life contexts. Data on barriers to political participation show various internal and external reasons that can be used to develop a scale for response costs, which could lead to a more comprehensive model of political participation readiness in the context of planetary health framing."

Ninety-six young adults completed the Autobiographical Memory Task, consisting of 6 negative and 6 positive cue words that were used to elicit autobiographical memories. Individual differences (i.e., between-person variance) in emotion regulation difficulties predicted increased vividness, and avoidant coping predicted third-person perspective in negative autobiographical memories. Notably, accounting for within-person variance in our outcome measures, emotion regulation difficulties did not predict the number of episodic details reported. Cognitive control did not moderate these pathways, and these processes did not affect positive memories. These findings highlight the importance of studying individual differences in emotion regulation and coping styles as they relate to the experience of autobiographical remembering. The implications of these findings in psychopathology are discussed."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/w65pm,2024-03-04,Narrative consistency impacts neural polarization,To be fetched,"The recent global pandemic set a powerful example of how quickly affectively polarized groups can form following exposure to new information. Yet, it remains unanswered how the consistency of information can regulate the polarization. In this social neuroscience study, we use neuroimaging to test how vaccination attitudes change when new information is presented and underscore an unobtrusive neural proxy capable of detecting subtle changes in affective polarization. We find that exposure to narratives that are extremely consistent with individuals’ beliefs leads to a decrease in neural (expressed as late beta rhythm) polarization. Conversely, extremely inconsistent narratives increase neural polarization. We test the long-term effects on the behavioral level almost a year later and find connections to the initial neural modulations. The results showcase that although providing counterinformation seems intuitive to mitigate affective polarization, it backlashes and increases polarization, while extremely consistent information reduces polarization."

However, studies rarely consider individual differences in cognition and how this may impact the effects of automation. This study investigated the impact of low-degree automation, and whether multi-tasking ability modifies its impact on the above outcomes. Two experiments were conducted with 216 undergraduate students. In Experiment 1, participants completed multi-tasking-based cognitive tasks to derive a multi-tasking index and engaged in a multi-tasking intensive air traffic control simulation under two conditions, manual and automated, applied to accepting and handing-off aircraft at the controlled airspace boundary where performance was assessed. SA was measured by Situation Present Awareness Method.  Workload was measured objectively by latency to SA queries. Experiment 2 extended the findings by utilizing a similar methodology on a different automated-assisted subtask - aircraft conflict detection. Experiment 2 retained SA and workload measures with the addition of the NASA-TLX for subjective workload. In both experiments, poorer multi-taskers exhibited greater benefits from automation applied to acceptance and hand-off, improved conflict detection and reduced workload. SA was greater in better multi-taskers. This work underscores the importance of considering individual cognitive differences when designing automated systems."

In response to these findings, we propose five recommendations: enhancing the evidence base through further research, addressing financial and resource barriers with cost-effectiveness studies and clear reimbursement models, developing comprehensive training programs, establishing continuous learning resources, and setting realistic expectations for VR's capabilities. These steps aim to facilitate VR's wider adoption in disability services, capitalizing on its promise to support neurodivergent individuals more effectively."

Previous studies have reported that they can discriminate the shape, size, thickness, and even material of objects through echolocation. However, little is known about the discrimination of quantities other than size and thickness (e.g., the number of objects). It is also unclear whether Weber's law (i.e., ratio dependency) holds for quantity discrimination through echolocation. In this study, we examined relative quantity judgments of visually occluded objects presented underwater by bottlenose dolphins. We found that they could discriminate pairs of same-sized objects ranging from one to eight, with performance improving as the difference ratio between the two numbers increased. In addition, their performance also improved as the magnitude of the number of objects involved increased. An additional test revealed that the accuracy of discrimination through echolocation was comparable to that of visual relative quantity judgments of the objects presented above water. On the other hand, under the condition that the overall size of each object (i.e., the sum of areas) was incongruent with the number of objects, performance was lower than when number and size were covarying. However, even within the incongruent condition, the effect of the number ratio was still observed, suggesting that the dolphins might have used various types of quantity information, such as number and size, flexibly to solve the task."

The model extension incorporated a panoply of factors that we laid against behavioral intentions, among which we explored ones with significant influence. In Study 1, we executed a screening survey, and after surveying 381 valid participants, we identified factors significant to purchase intent and built a model via structural equation modeling. In Study 2, we validated the model, analyzing how Japanese consumers make purchase decisions in a commoditized marketplace with many beverage options. Our results demonstrated that while a variety of factors would be related to Behavioral Intention, most notable among them was Reward, comprising facets such as taste, satisfaction, addictiveness, and desire. It was further affected by Mood, Perceived Quality, and Nostalgia. Our findings bring to light the importance of hedonic factors as they drive consumer choice by emphasizing the intrinsic value of sensory enjoyment and gratification in the experience of consuming green tea beverages.

Additionally, the reactive liberal model proposes that liberals are more prone than conservatives to feel threatened by the infringements of an out-group. Integrating COT and reactive liberal models, this study conducted an online experiment with Japanese adults. In the experiment, when the participants were shown an article about a territorial infringement by China, they felt COT and resisted Japan’s support of China’s policies. Furthermore, liberals were more inclined than conservatives to see the infringements as COT and therefore strongly resisted Japan’s support of China’s policies. These results indicate cultural invariance and ideological variance in COT."

Despite numerous linguistic-specific and cognitive explanations have been proposed since the topic was first introduced nearly fifty years ago, it remains unexplained why these hierarchies exist and continue to have pervasive effects on grammar. The field of prominence hierarchies as expressed through the languages of the world continues to be riddled with riddles. Under the five headings A) individuation and narrow reference phenomena, B) fronting mechanisms, C) the prominence of speech act participants, D) cultural variance and flexibility, and E) abstraction, we identify a set of unsolved mysteries, or conundrums, that require an explanation: 1) If animacy underlies PH, why can definiteness and specificity independently cause PH effects? 2) Why is individuation more pertinent for categories high up in the PH? 3) Why are personal names and kinship terms ranked above the category of humans, when they too reference humans? 4) How can one ‘empathise with’ an inanimate object when it is a topic, but not when the same referent is a regular direct object? 5) Why are topics given special priority, even when their referents are inherently low ranked? 6) Why can differentially marked objects be subjects of passive constructions when the same oblique cases in primary oblique functions cannot? 7) Why are question words and relative pronouns sensitive to animacy? 8) Why are first person pronouns, or sometimes first and second persons – the ‘speech-act participants’ – given special priority? 9) Why are abstract concepts always ranked the lowest? And finally, two related issues are discussed as the last conundrum: 10) Why do grammars rank some groups of humans as lower when these have a particular gender or ethnicity, and why are some animals ranked higher when they are domestic than wild, even if they belong to the same species? We attempt to resolve these conundrums with reference to the psychological Construal Level Theory (CLT) by suggesting that both PH and CLT structure the external world according to proximity or distance from the ‘Me, Here and Now’ (MHN) perspective. In language, MHN has the effect of structuring grammars; in cognition, MHN structures our lives, our preferences, and choices. Both, however, reflect a fundamental way in which the human mind works."

However, the precise mechanisms involved in processing these expressions within working memory (WM) remain elusive. To address this, our study employed a modified span task with forward and backward recalls to examine the impact of happy and angry emotional expressions on WM storage and updating. Our task incorporated various memoranda, including faces, shapes, and digits, within a single paradigm, enabling us to examine the influence of emotional expressions when they were either relevant (linked with faces) or non-relevant (linked with shapes or digits) to the task. Additionally, we administered a set of questionnaires to explore the potential influence of individuals' affective symptoms on their WM for emotional expressions. Our findings revealed distinct processing patterns for faces, shapes, and digits in WM, which align with previous research. Interestingly however, we did not find any significant impact of emotional expressions on WM performance. Furthermore, we discovered that WM for emotional expressions operated independently of individuals' affective symptoms, with a notable exception for utilizing reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy. In sum, our study provides novel insights into the complex interplay between emotion and WM, by shedding light on the mechanisms governing the processing of emotional expressions within this cognitive system."

Increasing rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth underscore the need to identify early predictors of risk. Theorists propose that the desire to die is driven by intense distress following social disconnection or rejection. Although ample empirical evidence supports the link between social factors and suicidality, there remains a gap in understanding how distinct processes within social communication relate to suicidality. We empirically demonstrate how two indicators of social communication (reciprocity of eye-gaze and facial expressions of happiness) differ during parent-adolescent conflict between dyads with adolescents who experience future suicidal ideation (SI) and those who do not. Methods. Facial affect analyses were based on a sample of 103 girls (ages 11-13; M=12.28; 75% White) and their parents (88.3% mothers). Eye-gaze analyses were conducted in subset of these dyads (N = 65; 90% mothers). Participants completed a conflict discussion as a part of a laboratory-based interaction paradigm during which participants’ gaze to their partners’ eyes was assessed using mobile eye-tracking glasses and facial affect was coded from videos of the discussion using FaceReader Observer XT. Adolescents’ SI was assessed 12-months later using the four-item suicide composite on the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Results.  We used actor-partner interdependence models within a multi-level structural equation modeling framework to test whether participants’ gaze and affect predicted their own and their partners’ gaze and affect one second later and if these intra and interpersonal dynamics would differ in dyads with and without future adolescent SI. Girls from dyads with less parental reciprocity of eye-gaze and happiness reported SI 12-months later. Conclusions. During early adolescence, girls whose parents reciprocate their eye-contact or positive affect less during conflict may be at heightened risk for SI. If replicated, patterns of eye-gaze and facial affect could provide promising targets of intervention to reduce suicidality prospectively."

The optimization of heat transfer within these heat sinks is paramount for enhancing thermal management in various applications. Among the critical factors influencing heat transfer characteristics, surface roughness of microchannel walls has garnered significant attention due to its profound impact on convective heat transfer and fluid flow behavior. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the influence of surface roughness on heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks, particularly focusing on electronic cooling applications. The research employs a combination of numerical simulations and experimental analyses to explore the intricate interplay between surface roughness, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics within microchannels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted to model the heat transfer phenomena and fluid flow behavior in microchannel heat sinks with varying degrees of surface roughness. Additionally, experimental studies are conducted to validate the simulation results and provide empirical insights into the heat transfer characteristics under different surface roughness conditions. The outcomes of this research elucidate the complex relationship between surface roughness and heat transfer performance in microchannel heat sinks. Through systematic analyses of thermal resistance, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficients, the study identifies optimal surface roughness parameters for maximizing heat dissipation efficiency while minimizing pressure drop penalties. Furthermore, the insights gained from this investigation facilitate the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks tailored to specific electronic cooling requirements. Overall, the findings from this study contribute to the advancement of thermal management techniques for electronic devices, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of microchannel heat sinks for enhanced heat dissipation capabilities in electronic cooling applications."

Despite numerous linguistic-specific and cognitive explanations have been proposed since the topic was first introduced nearly fifty years ago, it remains unexplained why these hierarchies exist and continue to have pervasive effects on grammar. The field of prominence hierarchies as expressed through the languages of the world continues to be riddled with riddles. Under the five headings A) individuation and narrow reference phenomena, B) fronting mechanisms, C) the prominence of speech act participants, D) cultural variance and flexibility, and E) abstraction, we identify a set of unsolved mysteries, or conundrums, that require an explanation: 1) If animacy underlies PH, why can definiteness and specificity independently cause PH effects? 2) Why is individuation more pertinent for categories high up in the PH? 3) Why are personal names and kinship terms ranked above the category of humans, when they too reference humans? 4) How can one ‘empathise with’ an inanimate object when it is a topic, but not when the same referent is a regular direct object? 5) Why are topics given special priority, even when their referents are inherently low ranked? 6) Why can differentially marked objects be subjects of passive constructions when the same oblique cases in primary oblique functions cannot? 7) Why are question words and relative pronouns sensitive to animacy? 8) Why are first person pronouns, or sometimes first and second persons – the ‘speech-act participants’ – given special priority? 9) Why are abstract concepts always ranked the lowest? And finally, two related issues are discussed as the last conundrum: 10) Why do grammars rank some groups of humans as lower when these have a particular gender or ethnicity, and why are some animals ranked higher when they are domestic than wild, even if they belong to the same species? We attempt to resolve these conundrums with reference to the psychological Construal Level Theory (CLT) by suggesting that both PH and CLT structure the external world according to proximity or distance from the ‘Me, Here and Now’ (MHN) perspective. In language, MHN has the effect of structuring grammars; in cognition, MHN structures our lives, our preferences, and choices. Both, however, reflect a fundamental way in which the human mind works."

This fear is called the collective ownership threat (COT). According to the concept of COT, territorial infringements pose collective ownership threats, which are linked to adverse intergroup relations. Given the distinct features of ethnic homogeneity and collectivism, we examine whether COT can be applied to an East Asian context, Japan. Additionally, the reactive liberal model proposes that liberals are more prone than conservatives to feel threatened by the infringements of an out-group. Integrating COT and reactive liberal models, this study conducted an online experiment with Japanese adults. In the experiment, when the participants were shown an article about a territorial infringement by China, they felt COT and resisted Japan’s support of China’s policies. Furthermore, liberals were more inclined than conservatives to see the infringements as COT and therefore strongly resisted Japan’s support of China’s policies. These results indicate cultural invariance and ideological variance in COT."

However, the precise mechanisms involved in processing these expressions within working memory (WM) remain elusive. To address this, our study employed a modified span task with forward and backward recalls to examine the impact of happy and angry emotional expressions on WM storage and updating. Our task incorporated various memoranda, including faces, shapes, and digits, within a single paradigm, enabling us to examine the influence of emotional expressions when they were either relevant (linked with faces) or non-relevant (linked with shapes or digits) to the task. Additionally, we administered a set of questionnaires to explore the potential influence of individuals' affective symptoms on their WM for emotional expressions. Our findings revealed distinct processing patterns for faces, shapes, and digits in WM, which align with previous research. Interestingly however, we did not find any significant impact of emotional expressions on WM performance. Furthermore, we discovered that WM for emotional expressions operated independently of individuals' affective symptoms, with a notable exception for utilizing reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy. In sum, our study provides novel insights into the complex interplay between emotion and WM, by shedding light on the mechanisms governing the processing of emotional expressions within this cognitive system."

Previous studies have reported that they can discriminate the shape, size, thickness, and even material of objects through echolocation. However, little is known about the discrimination of quantities other than size and thickness (e.g., the number of objects). It is also unclear whether Weber's law (i.e., ratio dependency) holds for quantity discrimination through echolocation. In this study, we examined relative quantity judgments of visually occluded objects presented underwater by bottlenose dolphins. We found that they could discriminate pairs of same-sized objects ranging from one to eight, with performance improving as the difference ratio between the two numbers increased. In addition, their performance also improved as the magnitude of the number of objects involved increased. An additional test revealed that the accuracy of discrimination through echolocation was comparable to that of visual relative quantity judgments of the objects presented above water. On the other hand, under the condition that the overall size of each object (i.e., the sum of areas) was incongruent with the number of objects, performance was lower than when number and size were covarying. However, even within the incongruent condition, the effect of the number ratio was still observed, suggesting that the dolphins might have used various types of quantity information, such as number and size, flexibly to solve the task."

This study delved into Japanese consumers’ perceptual model of bottled green tea beverages in the fiercely competitive market, exploring the psychological factors that lead to behavioral intentions using an extended Mehrabian and Russell Stimulus-Organism-Response model. The model extension incorporated a panoply of factors that we laid against behavioral intentions, among which we explored ones with significant influence. In Study 1, we executed a screening survey, and after surveying 381 valid participants, we identified factors significant to purchase intent and built a model via structural equation modeling. In Study 2, we validated the model, analyzing how Japanese consumers make purchase decisions in a commoditized marketplace with many beverage options. Our results demonstrated that while a variety of factors would be related to Behavioral Intention, most notable among them was Reward, comprising facets such as taste, satisfaction, addictiveness, and desire. It was further affected by Mood, Perceived Quality, and Nostalgia. Our findings bring to light the importance of hedonic factors as they drive consumer choice by emphasizing the intrinsic value of sensory enjoyment and gratification in the experience of consuming green tea beverages.

Groups were equally successful in comprehending relatively easy metaphors (Study 1), but older adults showed a striking advantage over younger adults for novel literary metaphors (Study 2). Mixed-effects modeling showed that measures of fluid and crystalized intelligence each made separable contributions to metaphor comprehension for both groups, but older adults relied more on crystalized intelligence than did younger adults. These age-related dissociations clarify cognitive effects of aging, and highlight the importance of crystalized intelligence for metaphor comprehension at all ages."

Using a longitudinal waitlist control group design, we tested if Muslim ethnic minority students (N = 128; Mage = 13.43, SDage = 0.84, 43% female) who participated in an 8-week school-based intervention, the Identity Project, would show greater exploration of their religious identity, leading to increases in their religious identity resolution and in turn resulting in better psychological adjustment (i.e., higher self-esteem, less depressive symptoms) and higher global identity. Preliminary analyses revealed that Muslim youth in our sample are characterized by high religious identity during adolescence, represented by high values on religious identity exploration and resolution. Latent-change score models demonstrated that greater changes in Muslim youth’s religious identity exploration predicted higher religious identity resolution, resulting in better self-acceptance and a higher sense of global identity. However, Muslim youth who showed a clear sense of their religious identity, did not indicate less affective and somatic depressive symptoms. We conclude that for Muslim youth religion seems to constitute an important part of their identity while promoting their positive adjustment. Our results indicate that multicultural approaches in schools – such as the Identity Project – should not only respond to students’ ethnic identities but should also more explicitly cater to their religious identities."

We used a cross-situational learning paradigm (CSL) to train native speakers of English on pseudowords containing a non-native European Portuguese nasal vowel. The effect of comprehension versus production practice was manipulated to measure the effect of task modality on learning words containing native and non-native sounds. In the CSL task, comprehension improved but pseudoword repetition accuracy declined over training. We observed no effect of task modality in the CSL task or the comprehension test, except a significant effect of production practice on accuracy in the production test. There was also no effect of native phonology in either the CSL task or the comprehension test. There was, however, a significant learning effect of nasal word types in the main analysis of the production test, contrary to our predictions. Our general findings support the robustness of CSL for novel word comprehension, rather than word production performance."

Constituting additional stress to normative developmental tasks in adolescence, immigrant-origin youth are in need of supportive resources fostering their well-being. Drawing on the risk and resilience framework and applying a strength-based perspective, the current study investigated refugee youth’s and youth of immigrant descents’ perspectives on their main challenges, tasks, and resources in Germany. The present study paid special attention to the interplay of acculturative challenges and developmental tasks in relation to the youth’s resources and their psychological well-being. Semi-structured interviews with six refugee youth and five second-generation youth of immigrant descent including nine boys and two girls between the ages of 14 – 16 (Mage = 15.45, SDage = 0.69) were analyzed. Using thematic analysis, data was structured in four themes: 1) acculturative challenges, 2) developmental tasks, 3) personal resources, and 4) social resources. Results highlight the importance of personal (incl., individual characteristics, identity, religion) and social (incl., supportive friends, family, teachers) resources to master the range of acculturative challenges (incl., language barriers, perceived ethnic and religious discrimination, cultural differences) and developmental tasks (incl., negotiation of autonomy, academic future planning). In addition, results indicate the importance of social resources for refugee youth and youth of immigrant descent when dealing with discriminatory experiences. Our findings offer practical implications for schools in terms of interventions focusing on both the strengthening of personal and social resources, and the reduction of challenges to promote immigrant-origin youth’s psychological well-being."

However, the focus on explicit processes might overlook relevant underlying cognitive processes. In this paper we take a different approach and explore the existence of an attentional bias among conspiracy theory believers. As an implicit measure of this attentional bias, we employ a colour-naming task containing topic- and conspiracy-related words. We hypothesized that 1) believers exhibit an attentional bias towards conspiracy-related words, 2) this bias is larger compared to non-believers, and 3) it is associated with self-reported conspiracy beliefs. In two experiments (total n = 418) conspiracy believers and non-believers completed the colour-naming task and we found support for believers’ conspiracy-related attentional bias. These findings contribute to understanding the self-sustaining nature of conspiracy beliefs, suggesting that believers may perceive or attend to information differently than non-believers. The results also indicate the promise of an implicit measure of conspiracy theory belief."

Given how important expectations of learning are for actual learning, we explored whether people accurately intuit this canonical progression in skill learning. Across five pre-registered experiments (n = 375), we find that people correctly predict that skill learning on a novel visuomotor task follows an exponential decay function, both for a naïve player and themselves, before even engaging with the task. Importantly, people are sensitive to conditions that merit exponential learning and rationally only predict exponential learning curves when a player puts in effort and the task is not too difficult. Although people accurately represent the overall shape of their learning in our task, we find that they misestimate specific parameters, which may have negative downstream effects on learning outcomes."

We also examined whether there were differences between men and women in this context. We jointly analyzed results from seven independent cross-sectional samples examined between 2017 and 2022 in Poland. A total of 5454 parents aged 18 to 59 participated in the studies at different stages of parenthood: up to 3 years after becoming a parent, being a parent for 4 to 7 years, being a parent for 8 to 12 years and being a parent for 13 years or more. Parents at different stages of parenthood were found to have significantly different levels of in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment. The results suggest that in the first years of parenthood, parents experience a relatively high in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment, which may decrease over time. The analyses also indicated that women are characterized by higher levels of in-depth exploration than men at each stage of parenthood. Men, on the other hand, experience stronger identity uncertainty related to their role as a parent."

Constituting additional stress to normative developmental tasks in adolescence, immigrant-origin youth are in need of supportive resources fostering their well-being. Drawing on the risk and resilience framework and applying a strength-based perspective, the current study investigated refugee youth’s and youth of immigrant descents’ perspectives on their main challenges, tasks, and resources in Germany. The present study paid special attention to the interplay of acculturative challenges and developmental tasks in relation to the youth’s resources and their psychological well-being. Semi-structured interviews with six refugee youth and five second-generation youth of immigrant descent including nine boys and two girls between the ages of 14 – 16 (Mage = 15.45, SDage = 0.69) were analyzed. Using thematic analysis, data was structured in four themes: 1) acculturative challenges, 2) developmental tasks, 3) personal resources, and 4) social resources. Results highlight the importance of personal (incl., individual characteristics, identity, religion) and social (incl., supportive friends, family, teachers) resources to master the range of acculturative challenges (incl., language barriers, perceived ethnic and religious discrimination, cultural differences) and developmental tasks (incl., negotiation of autonomy, academic future planning). In addition, results indicate the importance of social resources for refugee youth and youth of immigrant descent when dealing with discriminatory experiences. Our findings offer practical implications for schools in terms of interventions focusing on both the strengthening of personal and social resources, and the reduction of challenges to promote immigrant-origin youth’s psychological well-being."

Furthermore, the extent to which knowledge obtained from practising one skill, such as listening, may transfer to another skill, such as speaking, is a contentious debate (e.g., Li &amp; DeKeyser, 2017). We investigated how native phonology and production practice affects comprehension and speech production of novel non-native words. We used a cross-situational learning paradigm (CSL) to train native speakers of English on pseudowords containing a non-native European Portuguese nasal vowel. The effect of comprehension versus production practice was manipulated to measure the effect of task modality on learning words containing native and non-native sounds. In the CSL task, comprehension improved but pseudoword repetition accuracy declined over training. We observed no effect of task modality in the CSL task or the comprehension test, except a significant effect of production practice on accuracy in the production test. There was also no effect of native phonology in either the CSL task or the comprehension test. There was, however, a significant learning effect of nasal word types in the main analysis of the production test, contrary to our predictions. Our general findings support the robustness of CSL for novel word comprehension, rather than word production performance."

However, the focus on explicit processes might overlook relevant underlying cognitive processes. In this paper we take a different approach and explore the existence of an attentional bias among conspiracy theory believers. As an implicit measure of this attentional bias, we employ a colour-naming task containing topic- and conspiracy-related words. We hypothesized that 1) believers exhibit an attentional bias towards conspiracy-related words, 2) this bias is larger compared to non-believers, and 3) it is associated with self-reported conspiracy beliefs. In two experiments (total n = 418) conspiracy believers and non-believers completed the colour-naming task and we found support for believers’ conspiracy-related attentional bias. These findings contribute to understanding the self-sustaining nature of conspiracy beliefs, suggesting that believers may perceive or attend to information differently than non-believers. The results also indicate the promise of an implicit measure of conspiracy theory belief."

Juang","Identity formation constitutes a key developmental process during adolescence. This study extends previous research on ethnic identity development by focusing on the religious identity development of Muslim youth in Germany. Using a longitudinal waitlist control group design, we tested if Muslim ethnic minority students (N = 128; Mage = 13.43, SDage = 0.84, 43% female) who participated in an 8-week school-based intervention, the Identity Project, would show greater exploration of their religious identity, leading to increases in their religious identity resolution and in turn resulting in better psychological adjustment (i.e., higher self-esteem, less depressive symptoms) and higher global identity. Preliminary analyses revealed that Muslim youth in our sample are characterized by high religious identity during adolescence, represented by high values on religious identity exploration and resolution. Latent-change score models demonstrated that greater changes in Muslim youth’s religious identity exploration predicted higher religious identity resolution, resulting in better self-acceptance and a higher sense of global identity. However, Muslim youth who showed a clear sense of their religious identity, did not indicate less affective and somatic depressive symptoms. We conclude that for Muslim youth religion seems to constitute an important part of their identity while promoting their positive adjustment. Our results indicate that multicultural approaches in schools – such as the Identity Project – should not only respond to students’ ethnic identities but should also more explicitly cater to their religious identities."

In two experiments, healthy older adults (54–88 years) scored lower on a measure of fluid intelligence (Ravens Progressive Matrices) but higher on a measure of crystalized intelligence (Mill Hill Vocabulary Test) relative to younger adults (18–34 years). Groups were equally successful in comprehending relatively easy metaphors (Study 1), but older adults showed a striking advantage over younger adults for novel literary metaphors (Study 2). Mixed-effects modeling showed that measures of fluid and crystalized intelligence each made separable contributions to metaphor comprehension for both groups, but older adults relied more on crystalized intelligence than did younger adults. These age-related dissociations clarify cognitive effects of aging, and highlight the importance of crystalized intelligence for metaphor comprehension at all ages."

Little is known, however, about how this affects young children’s interactions with their caregivers. In this within-subjects study, we explored whether facial masks influence young children’s initiation and response to joint attention. We measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old infants with one of their caregivers using two standardised and free-play tasks. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks previously and are not influenced in their joint attention when the lower part of the caregiver’s face is concealed. Preface: This paper is associated with the paper “How Do Facial Masks Impact Infants’ Joint Attention?”. In the current text, we describe additional hypotheses and report the according analyses, results, and discussion."

Limited evidence-based support has been offered to FRs who have experienced occupational trauma using digital interventions (DIs). OBJECTIVE: To gain evidence from FRs relating to the impact of exposure to occupational trauma and describe the development of and planned protocol for testing an evidence-based, co-created DI called Sentinel to help manage and prevent trauma among FRs. METHODS: In phase 1, we conducted 52 interviews with FRs from fire and emergency, police, and emergency healthcare to explore the needs, views and experiences on using DI to support mental health. During phase 2, we developed the DI (Sentinel) content in consultation with current evidence, policy, theory and FRs experience. In phase 3, we plan to conduct a series of codesign workshops and development sprints to test and refine the DI (Sentinel). In phase 4, we will conduct a mixed methods non-randomized study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, usability and safety of the DI (Sentinel).  RESULTS: We expect data to be collected from up to 50 FRs for feasibility testing. We expect to conduct approximately 30 qualitative interviews with FRs who engaged in the Sentinel trial and 20 health and social care professionals who referred FRs to the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, safety, usability and implementation potential of the DI (Sentinel). The findings will inform the decision to proceed with a powered efficacy trial."

At present, climate anxiety is not operationalized consistently across the existing literature. It is important to gain more consensus on the definition and operationalization of climate anxiety to facilitate reliable and generalizable research and to further develop interventions. Content analysis can contribute to this by providing insight into the overlap in the content of climate anxiety measures. With a systematic search, this study identified and analyzed 12 distinct scales measuring climate anxiety. The 119 items covered a total of 57 disparate symptoms. Jaccard indices showed that the mean overlap between symptoms of different climate anxiety scales was generally very low, as was the overlap between pairwise comparisons of climate anxiety scales. These results highlight the lack of uniformity in assessing climate anxiety and the need to properly define and operationalize this concept. The potential reasons for low overlap and how this might impact the reliability and validity of existing measures is discussed. It is critical that future work aims at finding consensus on the definition of climate anxiety (e.g., through a Delphi study) and psychometrically comparing the different questionnaires."

In the present study, we addressed this gap by comparing older and younger adults’ performance in a cross-situational word learning paradigm, where participants learned novel word-referent mappings via statistical tracking of co-occurrences across multiple trials. Moreover, we tested whether this learning process was affected by previous experience with multiple languages (i.e., the bilingualism effect). We found that both age groups successfully learned non-native words after a short exposure, confirming that statistical learning ability is preserved in late adulthood. The two groups, however, differed in their learning trajectories and the younger group outperformed the older group during the later stages of learning. Previous language experience did not predict learning outcomes. Our findings have implications for language education in the older population, suggesting that implicit exposure is powerful for older adults learning a foreign language."

And yet, relatively little is known about what causes them. We provide an information-theoretic operationalization for two previous qualitative hypotheses about regressions, which we dub reactivation and reanalysis. We argue that these hypotheses make different predictions about the pointwise mutual information or pmi between a regression’s source and target. Intuitively, the pmi between two words measures how much more (or less) likely one word is to be present given the other. On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should occur between words that are disassociated with each other, implying negative, low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty, and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested: Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature. Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic principles."

Following the two-step theory integration program by Gigerenzer (2017), we first describe the commonalities and differences of empirical phenomena associated with motor heuristics and movement analogies, before we analyze how the two concepts produce functionally equivalent outcomes. Both motor heuristics and movement analogies try to explain how motor control and motor learning can be optimized, especially in circumstances of potential information overload. They emphasize the power of simplicity, postulating that “less-is-more” when it comes to the information that needs to be processed to enable successful sports performance. Motor heuristics simplify movement selection by rank ordering information, whereas movement analogies are thought to simplify movement execution by chunking information. We consider rank ordering and chunking as functionally equivalent cognitive means to achieve simplified information processing during actions and, thus, facilitating motor performance in circumstances of potential information overload. The Theory of Simplified Information Processing in Action encourages researchers to investigate underlying mechanisms of simplified information processing during actions and informs practitioners how to stabilize and improve performance by simplifying information processing."

Child language disorder is linked to an increased risk of mental health problems, yet the reasons for this association remain unclear. Understanding the factors influencing mental health outcomes in these children is crucial for targeted interventions. While a recent review on dyslexia has highlighted modifiable factors related to mental health, no such review exists for oral language disorder in childhood. This study seeks to fill this gap. Eligibility Criteria: The review will consider qualitative and quantitative studies published in English, including peer-reviewed literature, dissertations/theses, and sources with participants aged 24 years or younger. Adult participants reporting on childhood experiences of mental health, as well as proxy reports (e.g., parents), will be considered. The review will not consider non-English studies, reviews, books, protocols, and theoretical/opinion pieces. No restrictions will be placed on time or place of publication. Methods: This review will be guided by JBI guidelines. The following databases will be searched: ProQuest, PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase. Covidence will be used for review, with two independent reviewers applying eligibility criteria during title/abstract and full-text screening. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or with a third party. Results/Conclusion: The results will outline key findings and gaps in current literature. A socioecological framework will be used to categorise modifiable third factors at child-, family-, and community-levels. The outcomes, disseminated through publications and plain language summaries, may inform mental health and child language disorder conferences and guide future research directions."

Psychologists, among other professionals, were required to suddenly work remotely via telehealth during a period of global uncertainty, illness and mortality, community anxiety and lockdowns. This drastically altered the psychology practice, with the effects on clients and professionals still not fully understood. Aim To develop and validate a COVID-19-Related Stress Scale to evaluate psychologists’ experiences relating to the pandemic.  Methods The items of the COVID-19-Related Stress Scale were constructed based on an extensive qualitative report from the British Psychological Society, which identified key themes in psychologists’ pandemic experiences. Eight items were initially developed. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted, as well as tests for convergent and discriminant validity.  Results The sample comprised 99 psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand. After corrected item-total correlation testing, five items with significant and strong factor loadings (0.60 to 0.74) and two items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.54 to 0.56) were confirmed, resulting in a scale of seven items.  Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was α = .83, supporting a single-factor model (COVID-related stress, CVRS). A moderate relationship was found between CVRS and stress and compassion fatigue, validating its utility as a measure of stress. In contrast, no relationship was seen with resilience as a discriminant construct. Conclusion The Covid-19-related stress scale shows robust psychometric properties, which usefully assessed the impact of COVID-19 among psychologists in NZ. Although the lockdown phase of the pandemic has since ended, this measure provides valuable insights into the retrospective experiences of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. It may be adapted for unexpected scenarios requiring remote therapy, such as pandemics and natural disasters. The effect of remote work and community stress on mental health professionals requires ongoing consideration, and we propose that the CVRS is a useful tool for this research."

On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should occur between words that are disassociated with each other, implying negative, low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty, and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested: Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature. Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic principles."

Psychologists, among other professionals, were required to suddenly work remotely via telehealth during a period of global uncertainty, illness and mortality, community anxiety and lockdowns. This drastically altered the psychology practice, with the effects on clients and professionals still not fully understood. Aim To develop and validate a COVID-19-Related Stress Scale to evaluate psychologists’ experiences relating to the pandemic.  Methods The items of the COVID-19-Related Stress Scale were constructed based on an extensive qualitative report from the British Psychological Society, which identified key themes in psychologists’ pandemic experiences. Eight items were initially developed. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted, as well as tests for convergent and discriminant validity.  Results The sample comprised 99 psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand. After corrected item-total correlation testing, five items with significant and strong factor loadings (0.60 to 0.74) and two items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.54 to 0.56) were confirmed, resulting in a scale of seven items.  Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was α = .83, supporting a single-factor model (COVID-related stress, CVRS). A moderate relationship was found between CVRS and stress and compassion fatigue, validating its utility as a measure of stress. In contrast, no relationship was seen with resilience as a discriminant construct. Conclusion The Covid-19-related stress scale shows robust psychometric properties, which usefully assessed the impact of COVID-19 among psychologists in NZ. Although the lockdown phase of the pandemic has since ended, this measure provides valuable insights into the retrospective experiences of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. It may be adapted for unexpected scenarios requiring remote therapy, such as pandemics and natural disasters. The effect of remote work and community stress on mental health professionals requires ongoing consideration, and we propose that the CVRS is a useful tool for this research."

In the present study, we addressed this gap by comparing older and younger adults’ performance in a cross-situational word learning paradigm, where participants learned novel word-referent mappings via statistical tracking of co-occurrences across multiple trials. Moreover, we tested whether this learning process was affected by previous experience with multiple languages (i.e., the bilingualism effect). We found that both age groups successfully learned non-native words after a short exposure, confirming that statistical learning ability is preserved in late adulthood. The two groups, however, differed in their learning trajectories and the younger group outperformed the older group during the later stages of learning. Previous language experience did not predict learning outcomes. Our findings have implications for language education in the older population, suggesting that implicit exposure is powerful for older adults learning a foreign language."

Child language disorder is linked to an increased risk of mental health problems, yet the reasons for this association remain unclear. Understanding the factors influencing mental health outcomes in these children is crucial for targeted interventions. While a recent review on dyslexia has highlighted modifiable factors related to mental health, no such review exists for oral language disorder in childhood. This study seeks to fill this gap. Eligibility Criteria: The review will consider qualitative and quantitative studies published in English, including peer-reviewed literature, dissertations/theses, and sources with participants aged 24 years or younger. Adult participants reporting on childhood experiences of mental health, as well as proxy reports (e.g., parents), will be considered. The review will not consider non-English studies, reviews, books, protocols, and theoretical/opinion pieces. No restrictions will be placed on time or place of publication. Methods: This review will be guided by JBI guidelines. The following databases will be searched: ProQuest, PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase. Covidence will be used for review, with two independent reviewers applying eligibility criteria during title/abstract and full-text screening. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or with a third party. Results/Conclusion: The results will outline key findings and gaps in current literature. A socioecological framework will be used to categorise modifiable third factors at child-, family-, and community-levels. The outcomes, disseminated through publications and plain language summaries, may inform mental health and child language disorder conferences and guide future research directions."

At present, climate anxiety is not operationalized consistently across the existing literature. It is important to gain more consensus on the definition and operationalization of climate anxiety to facilitate reliable and generalizable research and to further develop interventions. Content analysis can contribute to this by providing insight into the overlap in the content of climate anxiety measures. With a systematic search, this study identified and analyzed 12 distinct scales measuring climate anxiety. The 119 items covered a total of 57 disparate symptoms. Jaccard indices showed that the mean overlap between symptoms of different climate anxiety scales was generally very low, as was the overlap between pairwise comparisons of climate anxiety scales. These results highlight the lack of uniformity in assessing climate anxiety and the need to properly define and operationalize this concept. The potential reasons for low overlap and how this might impact the reliability and validity of existing measures is discussed. It is critical that future work aims at finding consensus on the definition of climate anxiety (e.g., through a Delphi study) and psychometrically comparing the different questionnaires."

Following the two-step theory integration program by Gigerenzer (2017), we first describe the commonalities and differences of empirical phenomena associated with motor heuristics and movement analogies, before we analyze how the two concepts produce functionally equivalent outcomes. Both motor heuristics and movement analogies try to explain how motor control and motor learning can be optimized, especially in circumstances of potential information overload. They emphasize the power of simplicity, postulating that “less-is-more” when it comes to the information that needs to be processed to enable successful sports performance. Motor heuristics simplify movement selection by rank ordering information, whereas movement analogies are thought to simplify movement execution by chunking information. We consider rank ordering and chunking as functionally equivalent cognitive means to achieve simplified information processing during actions and, thus, facilitating motor performance in circumstances of potential information overload. The Theory of Simplified Information Processing in Action encourages researchers to investigate underlying mechanisms of simplified information processing during actions and informs practitioners how to stabilize and improve performance by simplifying information processing."

Limited evidence-based support has been offered to FRs who have experienced occupational trauma using digital interventions (DIs). OBJECTIVE: To gain evidence from FRs relating to the impact of exposure to occupational trauma and describe the development of and planned protocol for testing an evidence-based, co-created DI called Sentinel to help manage and prevent trauma among FRs. METHODS: In phase 1, we conducted 52 interviews with FRs from fire and emergency, police, and emergency healthcare to explore the needs, views and experiences on using DI to support mental health. During phase 2, we developed the DI (Sentinel) content in consultation with current evidence, policy, theory and FRs experience. In phase 3, we plan to conduct a series of codesign workshops and development sprints to test and refine the DI (Sentinel). In phase 4, we will conduct a mixed methods non-randomized study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, usability and safety of the DI (Sentinel).  RESULTS: We expect data to be collected from up to 50 FRs for feasibility testing. We expect to conduct approximately 30 qualitative interviews with FRs who engaged in the Sentinel trial and 20 health and social care professionals who referred FRs to the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, safety, usability and implementation potential of the DI (Sentinel). The findings will inform the decision to proceed with a powered efficacy trial."

Daum, Lea Mörsdorf, Charlotte Baldenweg","During the COVID-19 pandemic, children frequently interacted with people wearing facial masks. Little is known, however, about how this affects young children’s interactions with their caregivers. In this within-subjects study, we explored whether facial masks influence young children’s initiation and response to joint attention. We measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old infants with one of their caregivers using two standardised and free-play tasks. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks previously and are not influenced in their joint attention when the lower part of the caregiver’s face is concealed. Preface: This paper is associated with the paper “How Do Facial Masks Impact Infants’ Joint Attention?”. In the current text, we describe additional hypotheses and report the according analyses, results, and discussion."

Despite previous research acknowledging this difficulty, the specific dynamics of the argumentative essay writing process and where breakdowns occur remain unclear. In this study, we modeled the componential process underlying argumentative essay writing from multiple documents to understand the interactions among components that result in quality argumentation. The data were fitted to two competing theory-based Bayesian networks, a method highly suited to the modeling of cognitive processes identified with argumentative writing. The best-fitting model showed that the argumentative essay task is both initiated and sustained by higher-order integration components. This model lends support to the description of the process of argumentation writing from multiple documents put forth by the stage-based Integrated Framework of Multiple Texts. Further, we found that the process of argumentation falters due to students’ inability to frame counterarguments and their non-optimal critical analysis. This research not only enriches our understanding of the mechanics of argumentative writing from multiple sources, but the innovative Bayesian approach could lead to further refinement of the model by future researchers."

Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton 2023 Phil Trans R Soc B 378: 20210455 proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth."

But dyads exist embedded in broader, densely-interconnected social networks, and less research attention has been paid to the myriad ways in which people outside the dyad impact one’s welfare through their interactions with, or even their attitudes about, the other member of the dyad. What drives our feelings toward such extra-dyadic individuals? Balance Theory, an influential formalist theory in social psychology, suggests that our feelings are driven by the need for affective balance, achieved by, for example, liking strangers who share our feelings toward our existing partners or by disliking strangers who do not. We propose an alternative theory, the Embedded Dyad Framework, which foregrounds the substantive effects that strangers can have on our welfare through their interactions with our dyadic partners. Across four experiments (N=1,589) with U.S.-residing participants we predict and find, consistent with the Embedded Dyad Framework, that we like strangers who share our hatred for our rivals and our love for our friends (consistent with Balance Theory); but we dislike strangers who share our love for our spouses (contradicting Balance Theory). Further supporting predictions from an Embedded Dyad Framework, (a) greater perceived exclusivity in welfare-enhancing dyadic relationships (e.g., friendships) drives our lesser liking of strangers who share our love for our partners, and (b) greater perceived welfare suppression by our antagonistic partners (e.g., rivals) drives our liking of strangers who share our hatred of our antagonists. This framework outpredicts cognitive consistency views by emphasizing the real threats and opportunities that dyadic relationships afford people when dyads are embedded in social networks."

Relatedly, propensity for mind-wandering—or task unrelated thought—has been gaining attention among creativity scholars, but its effects on creativity remain unclear. The present study conceptually replicates and extends recent laboratory and experience-sampling work to assess the links between individual differences in divergent thinking, executive control abilities (working memory capacity and attention control), and measures of mind-wandering collected in both contexts. SEM analyses indicated that executive control factors weakly predicted divergent thinking scores, mainly due to their role in filtering out uncreative ideas rather than generating highly novel ones. Lab-based measures of mind-wandering didn't significantly correlate with overall creative thinking, challenging the idea that mind-wandering uniformly enhances creativity, but they were positively linked to highly creative divergent thinking scores. Daily-life measures of mind-wandering, meanwhile, did not provide stronger predictive insights into creative thinking than lab measures. Finally, exploratory analyses found that divergent thinking scores based on highly creative responses were positively associated with episodes of more fantastical, unrealistic mind-wandering, or “daydreaming.” We end our investigation with a call for greater theoretical precision and some hypotheses to guide future work.

This has been explained in terms of dynamical systems theory where internal oscillators couple to external rhythms for more fluent processing; this coupling is more efficient the closer the external rhythms are to the preferred rates of the internal oscillators. Thus, this more efficient coupling at one’s preferred rate should be associated with lower cognitive demands and better attentional entrainment compared to faster or slower rates. We tested this by measuring participants’ pupil sizes, a proxy for noradrenergic attention, while either listening or synchronizing their finger taps to metronomes played at rates faster, slower, or at their preferred rate. We found that synchronizing (relative to listening) to the faster and slower metronomes evoked larger pupil sizes whereas there was no difference at participants’ preferred rate. In line with dynamical systems theory, these results demonstrate that synchronizing is more cognitively demanding than listening only at tempi beyond one’s preferred rate. Furthermore, pupillary phase coherence increased while synchronizing compared to listening to all three metronomes, indicating that synchronous movements resulted in more efficiently allocated attention. Beyond their theoretical implications, our findings suggest that rehabilitation for movement disorders should be tailored to patients’ preferred rates to reduce cognitive demands. Moreover, attention and developmental disorders may benefit from pupillary entrainment as a diagnostic tool in rhythmic- and movement-based interventions."

Aggression is an umbrella term referring to behaviors intended to harm others. However, aggressive behaviors vary in terms of forms (i.e., physical, verbal) and functions (i.e., proactive, reactive).

Method. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to May 1st 2023 using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Image was used to meta-analyze voxel-based morphometry studies. Exploratory analyses on meta-analytic findings were conducted to identify their associated mental functions and examine their degree of overlap with brain lesion associated with aggression.   Results. A total of 92 experiments were included in the meta-analysis (N=2593, mean age=26.2, 68.5% males). General aggression was characterized by reduced grey matter volume (GMV) in the medial prefrontal cortex. Reactive aggression was associated with reduced GMV in the frontal pole, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and proactive aggression with greater GMV in the ventral caudate. Co-activation brain networks of these morphological correlates further distinguished reactive and proactive into socio-affective/somatosensory and motivational processes, respectively. We also found that the medial prefrontal cortex cluster of general aggression was a primary site in which focal brain lesion may increase the risk for aggression.  Conclusion. The current study highlight that functions of aggression are associated with distinct abnormalities in grey matter volume. These findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting potentially distinct aetiologies between aggression motives."

A study space analysis of the existing evidence.,To be fetched,"Because child-directed speech (CDS) is ubiquitous in some cultures and because positive associations between certain features of the language input and certain learning outcomes have been attested it has often been claimed that the function of CDS is to aid children’s language development in general. We argue that for this claim to be generalisable, superior learning from CDS compared to non-CDS, such as adult-directed speech (ADS), must be demonstrated across multiple input domains and learning outcomes. To determine the availability of such evidence we performed a study space analysis of the research literature on CDS. A total of 942 relevant papers were coded with respect to (i) CDS features under consideration, (ii) learning outcomes and (iii) whether a comparison between CDS and ADS was reported. The results show that only 16.2% of peer-reviewed studies in this field compared learning outcomes between CDS and ADS, almost half of which focussed on the ability to discriminate between the two registers. Crucially, we found only 20 studies comparing learning outcomes between CDS and ADS for morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features and none for pragmatic and extra-linguistic features. Although these 20 studies provided preliminary evidence for a facilitative effect of some specific morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features, overall CDS-ADS comparison studies are very unevenly distributed across the space of CDS features and outcome measures. The disproportional emphasis on prosodic, phonetic, and phonological input features, and register discrimination as the outcome invites caution with respect to the generalisability of the claim that CDS facilitates language development across the breadth of input domains and learning outcomes. Future research ought to resolve the discrepancy between sweeping claims about the function of CDS as facilitating language development on the one hand and the narrow evidence base for such a claim on the other by conducting CDS-ADS comparisons across a wider range of input features and outcome measures."

However, intergenerational relationships are both rare in the LGBTQ+ community and sorely needed as a buffer to the discrimination and harm that those within the community experience from systemic and structural oppression. Focusing on sexual identity, and employing a letter writing paradigm, we investigated the content of wisdom that LGB elders have to share with youth. In a descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods, and pre-registered study, 94 adults ranging in age 50 to 79 years (M = 55.98; SD = 6.30) wrote letters to a fictional youth, Sam, as well as completed surveys of psychosocial development and well-being. Letters were content coded for themes, as well as for emotional tone and subjective perspective.  The most common themes of wisdom shared included knowing and celebrating oneself, negotiating an oppressive society, and finding one’s community. Those who wrote more emotionally positive letters scored higher on measures of wisdom and generativity, and lower on embitterment. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of cultivating opportunities for wisdom-sharing within LGBTQ+ communities to promote flourishing across the lifespan."

Yet, little is known about the individual differences that shape the relationship between interpersonal synchronization to music and social bonding. The present research tests the hypothesis that this association is influenced by differences in empathy and creativity - two highly relevant factors in many musical activities. We implemented a synchronization task featuring a virtual drummer and measured self-other integration, a core component of social bonding. We employed a dual-measurement paradigm, incorporating both an explicit assessment (Inclusion of Other in the Self scale) and an implicit assessment (joint-Simon effect) of self-other integration . Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal explicit and implicit measurements correlating, nor were they similarly affected by interpersonal synchronization. This raises questions about the assessment of self-other integration in interpersonal synchronization experiments. Furthermore, we observed no moderating role of empathy or creativity in the association between interpersonal synchronization and self-other integration. Nevertheless, we found creativity to correlate with self-other integration. In light of this finding, we recommend placing greater emphasis on creativity as a decisive factor in the study of musical interaction."

A study space analysis of the existing evidence.,"Vera Kempe, Mitsuhiko Ota, Sonja Schaeffler","Because child-directed speech (CDS) is ubiquitous in some cultures and because positive associations between certain features of the language input and certain learning outcomes have been attested it has often been claimed that the function of CDS is to aid children’s language development in general. We argue that for this claim to be generalisable, superior learning from CDS compared to non-CDS, such as adult-directed speech (ADS), must be demonstrated across multiple input domains and learning outcomes. To determine the availability of such evidence we performed a study space analysis of the research literature on CDS. A total of 942 relevant papers were coded with respect to (i) CDS features under consideration, (ii) learning outcomes and (iii) whether a comparison between CDS and ADS was reported. The results show that only 16.2% of peer-reviewed studies in this field compared learning outcomes between CDS and ADS, almost half of which focussed on the ability to discriminate between the two registers. Crucially, we found only 20 studies comparing learning outcomes between CDS and ADS for morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features and none for pragmatic and extra-linguistic features. Although these 20 studies provided preliminary evidence for a facilitative effect of some specific morphosyntactic and lexico-semantic features, overall CDS-ADS comparison studies are very unevenly distributed across the space of CDS features and outcome measures. The disproportional emphasis on prosodic, phonetic, and phonological input features, and register discrimination as the outcome invites caution with respect to the generalisability of the claim that CDS facilitates language development across the breadth of input domains and learning outcomes. Future research ought to resolve the discrepancy between sweeping claims about the function of CDS as facilitating language development on the one hand and the narrow evidence base for such a claim on the other by conducting CDS-ADS comparisons across a wider range of input features and outcome measures."

Yet, little is known about the individual differences that shape the relationship between interpersonal synchronization to music and social bonding. The present research tests the hypothesis that this association is influenced by differences in empathy and creativity - two highly relevant factors in many musical activities. We implemented a synchronization task featuring a virtual drummer and measured self-other integration, a core component of social bonding. We employed a dual-measurement paradigm, incorporating both an explicit assessment (Inclusion of Other in the Self scale) and an implicit assessment (joint-Simon effect) of self-other integration . Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal explicit and implicit measurements correlating, nor were they similarly affected by interpersonal synchronization. This raises questions about the assessment of self-other integration in interpersonal synchronization experiments. Furthermore, we observed no moderating role of empathy or creativity in the association between interpersonal synchronization and self-other integration. Nevertheless, we found creativity to correlate with self-other integration. In light of this finding, we recommend placing greater emphasis on creativity as a decisive factor in the study of musical interaction."

Weststrate","Intergenerational relationships have been established as a critical locus of psychosocial development, meeting needs of identity development for youth, generativity for elders, and connection and belonging for both. However, intergenerational relationships are both rare in the LGBTQ+ community and sorely needed as a buffer to the discrimination and harm that those within the community experience from systemic and structural oppression. Focusing on sexual identity, and employing a letter writing paradigm, we investigated the content of wisdom that LGB elders have to share with youth. In a descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods, and pre-registered study, 94 adults ranging in age 50 to 79 years (M = 55.98; SD = 6.30) wrote letters to a fictional youth, Sam, as well as completed surveys of psychosocial development and well-being. Letters were content coded for themes, as well as for emotional tone and subjective perspective.  The most common themes of wisdom shared included knowing and celebrating oneself, negotiating an oppressive society, and finding one’s community. Those who wrote more emotionally positive letters scored higher on measures of wisdom and generativity, and lower on embitterment. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of cultivating opportunities for wisdom-sharing within LGBTQ+ communities to promote flourishing across the lifespan."

Smeekens, Rachel A. Booth, Thomas Kwapil, Paul Silvia, Michael J. Kane","Individual differences in executive functions (or executive control abilities) predict variation in creative thinking ability. Relatedly, propensity for mind-wandering—or task unrelated thought—has been gaining attention among creativity scholars, but its effects on creativity remain unclear. The present study conceptually replicates and extends recent laboratory and experience-sampling work to assess the links between individual differences in divergent thinking, executive control abilities (working memory capacity and attention control), and measures of mind-wandering collected in both contexts. SEM analyses indicated that executive control factors weakly predicted divergent thinking scores, mainly due to their role in filtering out uncreative ideas rather than generating highly novel ones. Lab-based measures of mind-wandering didn't significantly correlate with overall creative thinking, challenging the idea that mind-wandering uniformly enhances creativity, but they were positively linked to highly creative divergent thinking scores. Daily-life measures of mind-wandering, meanwhile, did not provide stronger predictive insights into creative thinking than lab measures. Finally, exploratory analyses found that divergent thinking scores based on highly creative responses were positively associated with episodes of more fantastical, unrealistic mind-wandering, or “daydreaming.” We end our investigation with a call for greater theoretical precision and some hypotheses to guide future work.

Merrie, Jaimie Krems, Daniel Sznycer","Research on close relationships often focuses on the dyad (e.g., dyads of romantic partners) and on how dyad members affect each other’s welfare. But dyads exist embedded in broader, densely-interconnected social networks, and less research attention has been paid to the myriad ways in which people outside the dyad impact one’s welfare through their interactions with, or even their attitudes about, the other member of the dyad. What drives our feelings toward such extra-dyadic individuals? Balance Theory, an influential formalist theory in social psychology, suggests that our feelings are driven by the need for affective balance, achieved by, for example, liking strangers who share our feelings toward our existing partners or by disliking strangers who do not. We propose an alternative theory, the Embedded Dyad Framework, which foregrounds the substantive effects that strangers can have on our welfare through their interactions with our dyadic partners. Across four experiments (N=1,589) with U.S.-residing participants we predict and find, consistent with the Embedded Dyad Framework, that we like strangers who share our hatred for our rivals and our love for our friends (consistent with Balance Theory); but we dislike strangers who share our love for our spouses (contradicting Balance Theory). Further supporting predictions from an Embedded Dyad Framework, (a) greater perceived exclusivity in welfare-enhancing dyadic relationships (e.g., friendships) drives our lesser liking of strangers who share our love for our partners, and (b) greater perceived welfare suppression by our antagonistic partners (e.g., rivals) drives our liking of strangers who share our hatred of our antagonists. This framework outpredicts cognitive consistency views by emphasizing the real threats and opportunities that dyadic relationships afford people when dyads are embedded in social networks."

Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton 2023 Phil Trans R Soc B 378: 20210455 proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth."

Despite previous research acknowledging this difficulty, the specific dynamics of the argumentative essay writing process and where breakdowns occur remain unclear. In this study, we modeled the componential process underlying argumentative essay writing from multiple documents to understand the interactions among components that result in quality argumentation. The data were fitted to two competing theory-based Bayesian networks, a method highly suited to the modeling of cognitive processes identified with argumentative writing. The best-fitting model showed that the argumentative essay task is both initiated and sustained by higher-order integration components. This model lends support to the description of the process of argumentation writing from multiple documents put forth by the stage-based Integrated Framework of Multiple Texts. Further, we found that the process of argumentation falters due to students’ inability to frame counterarguments and their non-optimal critical analysis. This research not only enriches our understanding of the mechanics of argumentative writing from multiple sources, but the innovative Bayesian approach could lead to further refinement of the model by future researchers."

In 129 girls (ages 11-13) oversampled for shy/fearful temperament, we thus examined how interactions between neural responses to social reward (vs. neutral) cues (measured during anticipation of peer feedback) and perceived social threat in daily peer interactions (measured using ecological momentary assessment) predict SA symptoms two years later. No significant interactions emerged when neural reward function was modeled as a latent factor. Secondary analyses showed that higher perceived social threat was associated with more severe SA symptoms two years later only for girls with higher basolateral amygdala (BLA) activation to social reward cues at baseline. Interaction effects were specific to BLA activation to social reward (not threat) cues, though a main effect of BLA activation to social threat (vs. neutral) cues on SA emerged. Unexpectedly, interactions between social threat and BLA activation to social reward cues also predicted generalized anxiety and depression symptoms two years later, suggesting possible transdiagnostic risk pathways. Perceiving high social threat may be particularly detrimental for youth highly sensitive to reward incentives, potentially due to mediating reward learning processes, though this remains to be tested."

The book created a storm of controversy after its 1994 publication, including its authors’ claim that it is “highly likely…that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences” in mean IQ scores between U.S. Whites and Blacks (African Americans). In this review, we evaluate not only Herrnstein and Murray’s ethnic-differences claims, but also the evidence they cited in support of “substantial” within-group IQ heritability (now in conflict with recent modest molecular genetic results). We show that the “twins reared apart” (TRA) studies supplying what the authors called the “most unambiguous direct estimates” of IQ heritability contain numerous biases, and that the results of the “most modern” TRA IQ study were based on omitted control group data, a reliance on false assumptions, and other “questionable research practices.” We then describe the major problems, biases, and unsupported assumptions found in IQ family, reared-together twin, and adoption studies while calling into question the validity of long-disputed concepts such as “heritability,” “IQ,” and “race.” Like many others before us, we conclude that Herrnstein and Murray presented no valid evidence in support of genetic causes of between-ethnic-group or social-class IQ score differences. And like few others before us, we also conclude that they produced no valid evidence that genes influence IQ score differences within groups. As in 1994, the authors’ social and political policy recommendations should be rejected because, among other reasons, they are based on faulty research coming increasingly to light in science’s replication crisis."

Study 1 presents a reanalysis and meta-analytic integration of prior studies (N = 18,291, k = 27) on the relationships between FFM traits and RIASEC interests. Results indicated that all FFM traits are associated with different interest configurations and that the strength of the relationship varies between traits. Study 2 uses a latent circumplex model that partitions the shared variance among interest scales into individual differences in profile levels and profile configurations. This made it possible to estimate standardized effect sizes of the strength of the relationship that allow a more meaningful interpretation about the actual overlap between the construct domains. The latent model was applied to the aggregated correlation matrix from Study 1 and to two additional datasets from Germany (N = 1,032) and Belgium (N = 1,317) that used an alternative eight-type interest taxonomy. Results were remarkably consistent across taxonomies and samples. The associations between FFM traits and interest profiles were mainly attributable to interest configurations. Openness was nearly as strongly related to individual differences in interest configurations as a typical interest scale. Similar strong associations with interest configurations were also found for Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas those with Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were weaker. In sum, our findings suggest that the overlap between the two construct domains is considerably stronger than previously assumed."

However, the extent to which statistical learning is a key contribution for children learning an additional language is less clear. Also, statistical learning is generally conceived as involved in implicit language learning, and it is unclear whether explicit instructions can interoperate with statistical learning in supporting children’s additional language learning. In this study, we investigated the extent to which children could learn both vocabulary and grammar from cross-situational statistics, and also tested the effect of explicit instruction over the language structure on learning under two exposure conditions, implicit and explicit instruction. We trained and tested fifty children, aged 8 to 9 years, on a complex artificial language comprised of 12 pseudo-words including nouns, verbs and case markers in a verb-final sentence order by means of a widely-used CSL paradigm (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2021; Rebuschat et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2020). All participants in implicit and explicit instruction condition were asked to determine which of the two animated scenes the complex transitive sentences related to. Children in the explicit instruction condition were also taught the language structure (the verb-final word order), while no such explicit information was provided for children in implicit condition. Children’s awareness of grammar knowledge was measured through debriefing questions after the learning of the artificial language. Results showed that children in both conditions successfully learned the grammar, but not the vocabulary, with the support of cross-situational statistics. There was no evidence for an effect of instruction on grammar and vocabulary acquisition, though we did find an initial benefit to learning from explicit instruction about the language grammar. Furthermore, explicit instruction on grammar significantly improved the awareness of grammar knowledge (categorised based on responses from debriefing questionnaires), yet this increased explicit awareness did not relate to grammar learning. The results have implications for theories of statistical learning, shedding light on our understanding of its developmental differences across the lifespan as well as the potential contribution of explicit information on learning. The study also has practical implications for optimising interactions between language teaching strategies and the child’s learning environment."

However, studies are heterogeneous in their methodologies and the health outcomes targeted, and it is unclear which health outcomes are most reliably benefited by positive writing techniques This systematic review aimed to determine the optimal conditions under which positive expressive writing interventions benefit subjective physical and psychological wellbeing in non-clinical populations. Method: A systematic search was conducted across four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest: APA PsychArticles) identifying peer-reviewed articles written in the English language from 1930 to August 2023. A total of 51 studies were identified and included seven different positive writing techniques: best possible self, positive experiences, gratitude, benefit finding, satisfaction processes, three good things and resource diary. Results: Most consistent benefits were found for positive wellbeing outcomes (e.g., optimism, happiness) whereas less consistent effects were reported for studies investigating negative health symptom outcomes (e.g., stress, anxiety). Best possible self and gratitude interventions revealed most consistent benefits. Several moderators were identified indicating that benefits may depend on individual differences relating to wellbeing, emotional and social factors. Conclusions: While reasonably consistent benefits of positive expressive writing were observed for positive wellbeing outcomes, the quality of all studies included in the review was assessed to be poor or fair. Thus, it is clear that more rigorous methods, including intention-to-treat analyses and robust reporting of methods and findings are needed. Future work should also aim to replicate the moderation effects reported in the present review, to enable a better understanding of the individual differences which influence the efficacy of positive expressive writing effects."

Smith, Mark Wetherell, Trudi Edginton","Background: Positive expressive writing has been increasingly researched over the past two decades due to its potential to serve as a low-intensity psychological self-help intervention. However, studies are heterogeneous in their methodologies and the health outcomes targeted, and it is unclear which health outcomes are most reliably benefited by positive writing techniques This systematic review aimed to determine the optimal conditions under which positive expressive writing interventions benefit subjective physical and psychological wellbeing in non-clinical populations. Method: A systematic search was conducted across four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest: APA PsychArticles) identifying peer-reviewed articles written in the English language from 1930 to August 2023. A total of 51 studies were identified and included seven different positive writing techniques: best possible self, positive experiences, gratitude, benefit finding, satisfaction processes, three good things and resource diary. Results: Most consistent benefits were found for positive wellbeing outcomes (e.g., optimism, happiness) whereas less consistent effects were reported for studies investigating negative health symptom outcomes (e.g., stress, anxiety). Best possible self and gratitude interventions revealed most consistent benefits. Several moderators were identified indicating that benefits may depend on individual differences relating to wellbeing, emotional and social factors. Conclusions: While reasonably consistent benefits of positive expressive writing were observed for positive wellbeing outcomes, the quality of all studies included in the review was assessed to be poor or fair. Thus, it is clear that more rigorous methods, including intention-to-treat analyses and robust reporting of methods and findings are needed. Future work should also aim to replicate the moderation effects reported in the present review, to enable a better understanding of the individual differences which influence the efficacy of positive expressive writing effects."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jz7ku,2024-02-29,The Bell Curve at 30: A Closer Look at the Within- and Between-Group IQ Genetic Evidence,"Jay Joseph, Ken Richardson","The year 2024 marks 30 years since the publication of The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. The book created a storm of controversy after its 1994 publication, including its authors’ claim that it is “highly likely…that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences” in mean IQ scores between U.S. Whites and Blacks (African Americans). In this review, we evaluate not only Herrnstein and Murray’s ethnic-differences claims, but also the evidence they cited in support of “substantial” within-group IQ heritability (now in conflict with recent modest molecular genetic results). We show that the “twins reared apart” (TRA) studies supplying what the authors called the “most unambiguous direct estimates” of IQ heritability contain numerous biases, and that the results of the “most modern” TRA IQ study were based on omitted control group data, a reliance on false assumptions, and other “questionable research practices.” We then describe the major problems, biases, and unsupported assumptions found in IQ family, reared-together twin, and adoption studies while calling into question the validity of long-disputed concepts such as “heritability,” “IQ,” and “race.” Like many others before us, we conclude that Herrnstein and Murray presented no valid evidence in support of genetic causes of between-ethnic-group or social-class IQ score differences. And like few others before us, we also conclude that they produced no valid evidence that genes influence IQ score differences within groups. As in 1994, the authors’ social and political policy recommendations should be rejected because, among other reasons, they are based on faulty research coming increasingly to light in science’s replication crisis."

Etzel, Bart Wille, Filip De Fruyt, Gabriel Nagy","This article proposes to link the Five Factor Model (FFM) personality traits to the vocational interest circumplex, a structural model for (1) the interrelations between interest domains and (2) individual differences in interest profiles. Study 1 presents a reanalysis and meta-analytic integration of prior studies (N = 18,291, k = 27) on the relationships between FFM traits and RIASEC interests. Results indicated that all FFM traits are associated with different interest configurations and that the strength of the relationship varies between traits. Study 2 uses a latent circumplex model that partitions the shared variance among interest scales into individual differences in profile levels and profile configurations. This made it possible to estimate standardized effect sizes of the strength of the relationship that allow a more meaningful interpretation about the actual overlap between the construct domains. The latent model was applied to the aggregated correlation matrix from Study 1 and to two additional datasets from Germany (N = 1,032) and Belgium (N = 1,317) that used an alternative eight-type interest taxonomy. Results were remarkably consistent across taxonomies and samples. The associations between FFM traits and interest profiles were mainly attributable to interest configurations. Openness was nearly as strongly related to individual differences in interest configurations as a typical interest scale. Similar strong associations with interest configurations were also found for Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas those with Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were weaker. In sum, our findings suggest that the overlap between the two construct domains is considerably stronger than previously assumed."

Hallion, Cecile D. Ladouceur","Recent theories suggest that for youth highly sensitive to incentives, perceiving more social threat may contribute to social anxiety (SA) symptoms. In 129 girls (ages 11-13) oversampled for shy/fearful temperament, we thus examined how interactions between neural responses to social reward (vs. neutral) cues (measured during anticipation of peer feedback) and perceived social threat in daily peer interactions (measured using ecological momentary assessment) predict SA symptoms two years later. No significant interactions emerged when neural reward function was modeled as a latent factor. Secondary analyses showed that higher perceived social threat was associated with more severe SA symptoms two years later only for girls with higher basolateral amygdala (BLA) activation to social reward cues at baseline. Interaction effects were specific to BLA activation to social reward (not threat) cues, though a main effect of BLA activation to social threat (vs. neutral) cues on SA emerged. Unexpectedly, interactions between social threat and BLA activation to social reward cues also predicted generalized anxiety and depression symptoms two years later, suggesting possible transdiagnostic risk pathways. Perceiving high social threat may be particularly detrimental for youth highly sensitive to reward incentives, potentially due to mediating reward learning processes, though this remains to be tested."

We characterized the chromatic statistics of the ‘visual diets’ of people living in remote rainforest and urban environments, by randomly sampling images using calibrated head-mounted cameras as participants went about daily lives. All environments, as is typical for natural scenes, had chromatic distributions with most variance along a roughly blue-yellow axis, but the extent of this bias differed across locations. If color perception and aesthetics are calibrated to the visual environments in which participants are currently immersed, variation in the extent of the bias in scene statistics should have a corresponding impact on perception and aesthetic judgements. To test this, we measured color discrimination and preferences for distributions of color for people living in the different environments. Group differences in the extent of blue-yellow bias in color discrimination were in the opposite direction to that predicted by the differences in scene statistics under an efficient coding framework, but were consistent with perceptual learning in local environments. Preferences for color distributions aligned with scene statistics, but not specifically to local environments, and one group preferred color distributions along an unnatural color axis orthogonal to that dominant in natural scenes.  These preferences could be explained by an interaction of culture and perceptual fluency.  Our study shows the benefits of conducting psychophysics with people at remote locations for understanding the commonalities and diversity in human perception."

The theory concludes that such asymmetric punishment would result in hygiene norms becoming ever stricter. We argue that, because complaints about one’s behavior might lead to protest, norms might not always change because of such complaints. We conducted an online experiment (N = 1023 Swiss adults) using handwashing as the target behavior. We replicated the asymmetry in punishment intensities and found that the intensity of protests against complaints about one’s too unhygienic behavior approached the intensity of these complaints.

One speech feature that shares overlapping acoustic dimensions with music is lexical tone.

This study tested this hypothesis by exploring whether and how music-to-language transfer facilitates L2 tonal word learning. We adopted a cross-situational word learning paradigm (CSWL) to test whether non-tonal language speakers could acquire tonal words without explicit instructions. Findings suggest that non-tonal speakers can use fine acoustic cues to learn tonal words by keeping track of cross-situational statistics and that musical aptitude (melodic perceptual ability) relates to tonal word learning for non-tonal speakers. Moreover, non-tonal learners could develop different levels of awareness regarding the pitch and duration of lexical tones, and awareness of acoustic cues could also predict non-tonal learners’ performance in CSWL."

Methods: This study aimed to assess AB in individuals with a history of substance dependence, specifically heroin users, utilizing Lavie's cognitive load theory (1995). Participants were categorized into a treatment group (TG), an abstinent group (AG), and a non-consumer group (NCG). An attentional task was designed based on Lavie's model, involving discriminating target letters (X or N) presented alone (low cognitive load, LCL), or among other letters (high cognitive load, HCL).  Results: According to Lavie's model (1995), it was anticipated that in the TG and AG groups, compared to the NCG, AB would manifest only in the LCL condition. No significant differences were found regarding AB towards consumption-related images (i.e., emotional images) compared to neutral stimuli in the LCL condition.  Conclusion: Our study did not find statistically significant results concerning AB between the TG and the AG when compared to the NCG. These findings contradict a significant body of research investigating selective attention in individuals with addiction, which consistently observed AB within this population."

Evidence that conflict adaptation can transcend contexts early in childhood.,To be fetched,"*This manuscript is not yet published* Developing the ability to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant information is crucial for navigating an ever-changing environment. This skill, cognitive control, can be studied using conflict tasks in which the relevant and irrelevant information in a trial either align or compete (congruency). Performance in these tasks can be affected not only by the current trial’s congruency but also by the previous trial’s congruency. In adults, this conflict adaptation has been reported to occur between trials of the same task and different tasks. The goal of this study was to study the development and flexibility of cognitive control by assessing conflict adaptation across different age groups and contexts. Two groups of children (aged 6 and 9 years) and one group of adults processed adaptations of the Stroop and Simon tasks and the resulting mouse-tracking variables (total movement time, initiation time, maximum absolute deviation values) were analysed. Across three experiments different context similarities were created depending on which tasks were combined. The results indicate that within-task conflict adaptation does not change qualitatively between 6-year-olds and adults. In contrast, across-task conflict adaptation does. Of note, transfer effects across very different contexts were observed in the youngest group of children, suggesting remarkable flexibility of cognitive control even early in development."

Industry actors and policymakers, while generally aware of the problem, have been reluctant to counter such communication, in part out of concern for players’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy online. However, these attitudes reveal flawed assumptions about how the human rights to privacy and freedom of expression apply in the online context. These rights are invoked to shield purveyors of hostile and exclusionary rhetoric from accountability, even as their speech serves to prevent the targets of hostility from enjoying their rights to expression, privacy, and freedom from harm. This paper argues that the human rights of victims of harassment and extremist violence should be weighed more heavily when designing policies that may abridge players’ freedom of expression and privacy interests. Industry actors need to counter more effectively the prevalence of hateful and extremist expression, even if doing so requires adjusting players’ expectations of privacy and freedom of speech. Lawmakers and regulators also have a role to play in changing the perception of gaming spaces as black boxes free from external scrutiny. They can do so by exercising adequate oversight of the game industry and striving for a better balance between the demands for free speech and privacy rights online, on the one hand, and the need to protect the human rights of victims of harassment and violence, on the other."

Yet, phonological skills in DD of Chinese, a logographic writing system, have rarely been systematically investigated. The present study aimed to systematically investigate PA, RAN, and VSTM deficits in Chinese children with DD. Method: We compared 128 three and fourth grade Mandarin-speaking Chinese children with DD aged between 8 and 11 years (Mean age = 9.4 years, 73 male) and 135 age-matched controls on 7 phonological tasks, including 3 PA tasks (phoneme deletion, onset rime deletion, and spoonerism), 3 RAN tasks (digit, object, and color), and a VSTM task (digit span). A combination of logistic regression analysis and a machine learning approach with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were employed for data analyses.  Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that similar to results from DD in six European languages by Landerl and Ramus et al.

SHAP analysis revealed that the most effective predictor tasks for Chinese DD are RAN pictures, phoneme deletion, and spoonerism.

Therefore, ways to strengthen them are sought after. Stays abroad have many positive impacts on travelers, and there are preliminary indications that they may also provide opportunities to strengthen travelers' global identity and nature connectedness. In the current study, we thus examined the potential effects of long-term stays abroad on global identity and nature connectedness of young people. We conducted an online survey in three participant groups (N = 292): An experienced group which had returned from a long-term stay abroad, a planning group which intended but had not yet experienced such a stay, and a home group which had neither experienced nor planned a long-term stay abroad. We found a stronger global self-investment (i.e., one dimension of global identity reflecting solidarity and concern for people all over the world) for the experienced group compared to the home group. The groups did not differ with regard to nature connectedness. Moreover, we found that global identity was positively related to the amount of contact with international people met abroad. In sum, our results suggest that long-term stays abroad may increase the global self-investment of travelers, particularly if international experiences with people are made."

However, it is not clear how this purportedly transdiagnostic core vulnerability is associated with internalizing psychopathology at the symptom level. Using a newly developed measure of this transdiagnostic core vulnerability, we aimed to identify which internalizing symptoms were most relevant to the core vulnerability.  Methods: We fit an undirected network model composed of 36 internalizing symptoms nodes, four subscale nodes, and one node representing the core vulnerability to cross-sectional data obtained from 907 university students.  Results: The core vulnerability was found to be transdiagnostic in that it was associated with symptoms spanning the different forms of internalizing psychopathology. Importantly, the core vulnerability was differentially associated with these symptoms. Of the various affective, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms analyzed, the core vulnerability only demonstrated direct and prominent associations with cognition-related internalizing symptoms. These associations varied in potency, with the symptom of feeling like a failure displaying the strongest association with the core vulnerability. Limitations: The cross-sectional data used here prevents us from disentangling the between- and within-person effects for any given conditional association in our network. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of conducting symptom-focused investigations of the interface between the transdiagnostic core vulnerability construct and internalizing psychopathology.

However, research on this topic primarily focused on young adulthood, leaving it unclear whether and how the perception of life events varies across the life course. In this study, we examined the relationship between age and different perceived event characteristics using nationally representative data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Innovation Sample (N = 1,044). We found that people reported different event types across among age groups. Furthermore, the perception of life events varied across age and depending on whether an event was experienced at a normative age or not. These findings underline the necessity to take on a life-course perspective when examining life events and support theoretical claims on the relevance of age norms in life-event research."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/r3q79,2024-02-28,Scalar alternative activation in implicature processing: A lexical decision study with antonyms and negation,To be fetched,"Scalar words such as 'warm' often give rise to inferences like 'warm but not hot'. Under standard accounts, such scalar implicatures are derived by negating stronger alternatives. Research has shown that in online processing, weaker scale-mates ('warm') prime stronger ones ('hot'), suggesting that the latter are used in implicature processing (De Carvalho et al, 2016; Ronai &amp; Xiang, 2023). We test different theories of scalar implicature processing by examining whether priming holds when no implicature is expected to arise. This is crucial to know whether and what kinds of alternatives form the basis of scalar implicature computation. We first focused on sentences with negation and asked whether 'hot' is primed when comprehenders are exposed to sentences containing 'not warm'. Then, we tested antonyms, such as 'cool', which are assumed to be on a separate scale. Lastly, we tested negated antonyms (i.e., 'not cool'). As a control, we also ran an experiment with isolated antonym words without any sentential context. In line with theoretical accounts (Horn, 1972), negated scale-mates did not prime strong ones. Contrary to these accounts, however, antonyms primed the target words ('hot'). Negation seems to have also cancelled the activation of targets for antonymic primes. In a joint analysis of our sentential experiments with the addition of the data from Ronai &amp; Xiang (2023), which tested the priming by non-negated scale-mates, we found that negation interacted with both scale-mate primes and antonym primes. We explain these findings within the Alternative Activation Account (Gotzner, 2017), which assumes an initial activation of a broad cohort of associated expressions and their subsequent grammatical and contextual narrowing."

This study seeks to bridge this gap by investigating the unique sensory preferences and needs of autistic adults, with the objective of informing sensory room designs to better accommodate their specific requirements.  Methods: An online mixed-methods survey, divided into three parts, was conducted. Part One utilised the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-50) to screen for autistic traits and participants scoring above the threshold of 25 were invited for further studies. Part Two 1comprised a survey incorporating open-ended and closed questions to assess participants' sensory and relaxation preferences. Part Three also used an online survey and targeted individuals with prior sensory room exposure to assess their experiences. Qualitative results were analysed using thematic analysis.  Results: Of the 150 participants screened in Part One, 96 and 13 participants completed Part Two and Three, respectively. Results of the study found that whilst general themes can be identified, autistic adults use a diverse range of methods and sensory modulation techniques to facilitate relaxation. When asked about preferred relaxation activities, themes such as the use of active or passive media arose, as did spending time outdoors, in solitude, or engaging in creative activities. However, there was a considerable amount of diversity between participants regarding how they chose to interact with the items that comprise each theme. In terms of specific sensory modalities, visual, auditory, and somatosensory were identified as the primary senses that can affect relaxation, particularly through customised lighting or sounds, however, these preferences were highly person specific.  Conclusions: Our findings emphasise the importance of taking an individualized approach when designing calming spaces for this demographic. The study reveals a wide range of methods autistic adults use to self-regulate, spanning customized environmental changes, sensory stimulation, nature, media engagement, and internal coping strategies. Additionally, suggestions for improving existing spaces focus on increasing personalization and control to better meet individual sensory needs."

In recent years, archaeologists have provided substantial evidence for the remarkable time-depth of symbolic artifact utilization and have made groundbreaking methodological advances (e.g, with respect to dating techniques, microscopy and 3d modeling). However, a systematic and rigorous framework for the investigation of the symbolic function of past artifacts is still lacking, that is, what kind of purpose these tools may have served and what kind of symbolic work they were designed or co- opted to do. This paper responds to this lacuna and outlines a new conceptual framework for the investigation of early symbolic artifacts. Symbolic artifacts are special in the sense of being mind- directed as they do their work primarily in the social and cognitive domain. That is, they support their function only to the extent that their structural properties affect relevant cognitive processes related to symbolic cognition (including e.g., attention, memory, and discrimination). To inform our understanding of past symbolic behavior, we therefore introduce the concept of cognitive affordances, defined as the capacity of symbolic forms to support such relevant cognitive processes. The cognitive affordances constitute a mediating layer of analysis between the observable, structural traits of symbolic artifacts and their hypothesized role in past social and pragmatic behaviors of hominins, related to, for instance, aesthetic, communicative, or ritual/cosmological practices. We show that by studying the cognitive implications of variation and change in the structural properties of symbolic artifacts recovered from the archaeological record, we can inform inferences and test new hypotheses about what pragmatic functions they may have served in past Paleolithic society."

Under standard accounts, such scalar implicatures are derived by negating stronger alternatives. Research has shown that in online processing, weaker scale-mates ('warm') prime stronger ones ('hot'), suggesting that the latter are used in implicature processing (De Carvalho et al, 2016; Ronai &amp; Xiang, 2023). We test different theories of scalar implicature processing by examining whether priming holds when no implicature is expected to arise. This is crucial to know whether and what kinds of alternatives form the basis of scalar implicature computation. We first focused on sentences with negation and asked whether 'hot' is primed when comprehenders are exposed to sentences containing 'not warm'. Then, we tested antonyms, such as 'cool', which are assumed to be on a separate scale. Lastly, we tested negated antonyms (i.e., 'not cool'). As a control, we also ran an experiment with isolated antonym words without any sentential context. In line with theoretical accounts (Horn, 1972), negated scale-mates did not prime strong ones. Contrary to these accounts, however, antonyms primed the target words ('hot'). Negation seems to have also cancelled the activation of targets for antonymic primes. In a joint analysis of our sentential experiments with the addition of the data from Ronai &amp; Xiang (2023), which tested the priming by non-negated scale-mates, we found that negation interacted with both scale-mate primes and antonym primes. We explain these findings within the Alternative Activation Account (Gotzner, 2017), which assumes an initial activation of a broad cohort of associated expressions and their subsequent grammatical and contextual narrowing."

We found that people reported different event types across among age groups. Furthermore, the perception of life events varied across age and depending on whether an event was experienced at a normative age or not.

While contemporary research on this topic originated in the USA and Europe, it is now expanding in China, India, and South Korea. Scholars are proposing novel frameworks and assessment tools, yet the primary challenge remains establishing a shared understanding of this phenomenon. Studies indicate that despite different perspectives, all approaches converge on the notion of meaningfulness that a sense of calling infuses into work and life. However, unresolved inquiries persist regarding the origin of one's calling, its altruistic nature, the influence of religion, and other dimensions. Despite the complexities in defining a unified concept, it's evident that a calling significantly influences both work and overall life. On one hand, it enhances work and life satisfaction, alleviates stress and burnout, and aids in career and life decisions. Conversely, it may expose individuals to exploitation by employers, necessitate sacrifices in other life domains, and lead to regrets if implementation proves impractical. The primary aim of this article is to prompt Russian psychology scholars to study the phenomenon of life calling, fostering research that places it within the broader contexts of meaning, choice, and self-actualization."

A meta-analysis will be conducted using psychological and physiological measures of stress and burnout. Burnout is framed as a state of physical and mental exhaustion encoded in a diagnosis by Z73.0 in the ICD-10-CM and negatively affects an individual’s psychological and physical health. It also decreases work performance and affects employers through increased absenteeism and employee turnover. Mindfulness intervention is the most reported intervention for burnout and has been found to offer statistically significant effects in improving stress levels and reducing burnout. Recent research has examined focused meditation, a particular type of mindfulness training, and the role of its effects of attentional regulation and emotion regulation in reducing stress and burnout. Studies will be included which have participants working in high-risk areas including emergency services, the military, corporate executive management or healthcare workers who participated in a meditation intervention prior to the onset of burnout. Psychological outcomes, including Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM), Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Bergen Burnout Inventory (BBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and physiological outcomes including cortisol levels, heart rate variability, blood pressure, stress reactivity, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the meditation intervention.

Results of stepwise discriminant function analyses revealed that the intensity-based approach yielded the highest classification accuracy followed by the frequency-based and the duration-based approach, respectively. More importantly, German- accented English utterances were more frequently classified as native English utterances than German-accented French as native French utterances were.

The central challenge in the study of ecological grief is that its theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. Recent discussions in philosophy of emotions elucidate that a central element in this theoretical challenge is determining what the object of ecological grief is. In turn, our understanding of the object of ecological grief goes hand in hand with our understanding of the nature of ecological grief. This paper develops a phenomenological analysis of cross-cultural subjective reports that identifies crucial themes in the experience of ecological grief. This phenomenological analysis reveals the object of ecological grief as the loss of the life possibilities that are sustained by dwelling. The resulting view is that ecological grief corresponds to a crisis in dwelling — a disturbance in the very way we inhabit our home environment."

Early work in real-world environments suggested that having matching encoding/retrieval contexts improves memory. However, some laboratory-based studies have not replicated this advantageous context-dependent memory effect. Using virtual reality methods, we find support for context-dependent memory effects, and examine an influence of memory schema and dynamic environments. Participants (N = 240) remembered more objects when in the same virtual environment (context) as during encoding. This traded-off with falsely ‘recognizing’ more similar lures. Experimentally manipulating the virtual objects and environments revealed that a congruent object/environment schema aids recall (but not recognition), though a dynamic background does not. These findings further our understanding of when and how context affects our memory through a naturalistic approach to studying such effects."

First, we identify and highlight three factors that mitigate decisions under stress conditions: decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors. Second, we situate workplace stress in forensic science within the Challenge-Hindrance Stress Framework. We argue that stressors in forensic science workplaces can have a positive or a negative impact, depending on the type, level, and context of stress. Developing an understanding of the stressors, their sources, and their possible impact, can help forensic service providers and researchers to implement context-specific interventions to manage stress at work and optimize expert performance."

On the basis of new evidence and a deeper analysis of previous evidence presented here, it is very reasonable to conclude based on Bohr’s own words that Bohr read James’s complementarity between approximately 1908 and 1912.  An Appendix provides the relevant text from both Bohr’s Nobel biography and his interview with the American Institute of Physics to support this conclusion.  Bohr’s description of significant events in his life are matched with dates in his Nobel biography, adding support to the conclusion.  How Bohr specifically adapted James’s complementarity to physics is presented.  Bohr’s discussion of “mental activity” is compared here to James’s definition of complementarity focusing on consciousness and is found to be extremely similar to James’s definition.  In addition, a side by side comparison of James’s definition of complementarity and Bohr’s most important and well-known definition of complementarity for physics is presented.  This comparison shows just how Bohr adapted James’s complementarity to Bohr’s complementarity for physics.  Examining the chapters “The Stream of Thought”” (chapter 9 in James’s “The Principles of Psychology”) and “The Relation of Minds to Other Things” (chapter 8 in “The Principles of Psychology”) shows that the very evidence that James used to develop complementarity in “The Relation of Minds to Other Things” is discussed in “The Stream of Thought,” a chapter that Bohr acknowledged reading and concerning which he had a very high opinion.  It is also made clear in the paper that Bohr was aware that he had a choice to adopt complementarity for physics along the lines of James’s complementarity, which he had read, and that he rejected this possibility.  Instead, in his complementarity for physics, Bohr adopted a very different approach fundamentally based on the necessity of a physical interaction between a physical system and a physical measuring apparatus with an uncontrolled aspect to obtain a specific measurement result.  Bohr attempted to apply the uncertainty principle to this uncontrolled feature of the physical interaction.  Bohr’s approach has been the widely adopted framework for understanding quantum measurement since 1927.  The historical description of complementarity in Bohr’s Nobel biography is discussed in light of the evidence presented and is shown to be incorrect.  It is important to set the record straight regarding the origin of complementarity so that James’s complementarity is not seen as an appendage of Bohr’s version of complementarity for physics.  Bohr’s attempt to extrapolate what his Nobel biography incorrectly states was complementarity originally developed by Bohr, which was for physics, to other fields confuses and detracts from the importance of James’s complementarity which was in fact the original.  Bohr’s detour with his proposed necessity (and its proposed fundamental significance) of a physical interaction in the measuring process with an uncontrolled aspect in quantum mechanics has distracted attention away from the possible significance of James’s original concept in psychology to quantum measurement, including its evaluation on its own merits as to whether it provides the correct conceptual framework for this measurement."

Behavioral IPS has been studied increasingly in various contexts, such as a feature of the social interaction difficulties inherent to autism. To fully understand the dynamics of behavioral IPS, or reductions thereof in autism, the neural basis of IPS perception needs to be established, as it is an arguably essential ingredient to achieve IPS when engaging in social interactions. Thus, the current study’s aim was twofold: to establish the basic neuro-perceptual processing of IPS in typical observers and to test whether it might differ in autistic individuals. In a task-based fMRI paradigm, participants viewed short, silent video vignettes of humans during social interactions featuring a variation of behavioral IPS. The results show that IPS modulates the Action Observation Network. Interestingly, autistic participants showed the same IPS modulation of neural activation patterns as non-autistic participants, suggesting that IPS perception is spared and likely not underlying reduced behavioral IPS in autism. Nevertheless, a general difference of processing social interactions was found in autistic observers characterized by decreased neural activation in the right middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, and superior temporal areas. This may implicate frontoparietal regions as a source of attenuation for integrating top-down modulation during social interactions. As such, the attenuated production of behavioral IPS and subsequently social interaction difficulties in autism may not stem from differences in perceiving the timing of other’s behavior, but rather from altered integration thereof into the temporal coordination of behavior when interacting with others."

On the basis of new evidence and a deeper analysis of previous evidence presented here, it is very reasonable to conclude based on Bohr’s own words that Bohr read James’s complementarity between approximately 1908 and 1912.  An Appendix provides the relevant text from both Bohr’s Nobel biography and his interview with the American Institute of Physics to support this conclusion.  Bohr’s description of significant events in his life are matched with dates in his Nobel biography, adding support to the conclusion.

Coutanche","How does our environment impact what we will later remember? Early work in real-world environments suggested that having matching encoding/retrieval contexts improves memory. However, some laboratory-based studies have not replicated this advantageous context-dependent memory effect. Using virtual reality methods, we find support for context-dependent memory effects, and examine an influence of memory schema and dynamic environments. Participants (N = 240) remembered more objects when in the same virtual environment (context) as during encoding. This traded-off with falsely ‘recognizing’ more similar lures. Experimentally manipulating the virtual objects and environments revealed that a congruent object/environment schema aids recall (but not recognition), though a dynamic background does not. These findings further our understanding of when and how context affects our memory through a naturalistic approach to studying such effects."

The central challenge in the study of ecological grief is that its theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. Recent discussions in philosophy of emotions elucidate that a central element in this theoretical challenge is determining what the object of ecological grief is. In turn, our understanding of the object of ecological grief goes hand in hand with our understanding of the nature of ecological grief. This paper develops a phenomenological analysis of cross-cultural subjective reports that identifies crucial themes in the experience of ecological grief. This phenomenological analysis reveals the object of ecological grief as the loss of the life possibilities that are sustained by dwelling. The resulting view is that ecological grief corresponds to a crisis in dwelling — a disturbance in the very way we inhabit our home environment."

Therefore, it is important to understand and manage workplace stress, but that is not simple or straightforward. This paper explores stress as a human factor that influences forensic expert decision-making. First, we identify and highlight three factors that mitigate decisions under stress conditions: decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors. Second, we situate workplace stress in forensic science within the Challenge-Hindrance Stress Framework. We argue that stressors in forensic science workplaces can have a positive or a negative impact, depending on the type, level, and context of stress. Developing an understanding of the stressors, their sources, and their possible impact, can help forensic service providers and researchers to implement context-specific interventions to manage stress at work and optimize expert performance."

The rhythmic patterns of native and German-accented English and French, and native, English- and French-accented German utterances from the Bonne Tempo corpus were analyzed using three rhythm metrics based on duration variability, amplitude envelope modulation frequency, and intensity variability. Results of stepwise discriminant function analyses revealed that the intensity-based approach yielded the highest classification accuracy followed by the frequency-based and the duration-based approach, respectively. More importantly, German- accented English utterances were more frequently classified as native English utterances than German-accented French as native French utterances were. In addition, a higher percentage of English-accented German utterances were classified as native German utterances than French-accented German by the duration- and the frequency-based metrics, but not by the intensity-based metrics. Overall, the results suggested facilitative effects of shared rhythmic class in L2 speech learning."

While contemporary research on this topic originated in the USA and Europe, it is now expanding in China, India, and South Korea. Scholars are proposing novel frameworks and assessment tools, yet the primary challenge remains establishing a shared understanding of this phenomenon. Studies indicate that despite different perspectives, all approaches converge on the notion of meaningfulness that a sense of calling infuses into work and life. However, unresolved inquiries persist regarding the origin of one's calling, its altruistic nature, the influence of religion, and other dimensions. Despite the complexities in defining a unified concept, it's evident that a calling significantly influences both work and overall life. On one hand, it enhances work and life satisfaction, alleviates stress and burnout, and aids in career and life decisions. Conversely, it may expose individuals to exploitation by employers, necessitate sacrifices in other life domains, and lead to regrets if implementation proves impractical. The primary aim of this article is to prompt Russian psychology scholars to study the phenomenon of life calling, fostering research that places it within the broader contexts of meaning, choice, and self-actualization."

A meta-analysis will be conducted using psychological and physiological measures of stress and burnout. Burnout is framed as a state of physical and mental exhaustion encoded in a diagnosis by Z73.0 in the ICD-10-CM and negatively affects an individual’s psychological and physical health. It also decreases work performance and affects employers through increased absenteeism and employee turnover. Mindfulness intervention is the most reported intervention for burnout and has been found to offer statistically significant effects in improving stress levels and reducing burnout. Recent research has examined focused meditation, a particular type of mindfulness training, and the role of its effects of attentional regulation and emotion regulation in reducing stress and burnout. Studies will be included which have participants working in high-risk areas including emergency services, the military, corporate executive management or healthcare workers who participated in a meditation intervention prior to the onset of burnout. Psychological outcomes, including Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM), Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Bergen Burnout Inventory (BBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and physiological outcomes including cortisol levels, heart rate variability, blood pressure, stress reactivity, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the meditation intervention. The PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL database search and a meta-analysis will be conducted comparing data extracted from standard burnout measures and inventories and physiological measures."

In this study, I investigated the beliefs and attitudes that students have about grade weights (i.e., % of grade things are worth) by having them select grade weights for grade components and select their preferences for proportional or inversely proportional grade weights depending on assignment characteristics. Students ended up choosing grade weights that benefited their grades. Students who do not do well on exams choose a lower maximum grade weight for exams. Most students preferred grade weights to be proportional to time spent, difficulty, and length of assignments, while inversely proportional to strictness of grading. Overall, these results show that students would like grades to reflect the effort they put in. While they do not mind the difficulty of assignments, they do care whether something will be graded strictly."

Yet in humans, most group behaviour is often attributed to explicit central control or social norms, rather than to synergistic interplay between individuals. Here we introduce Synch.Live, a participatory behavioural science experiment for quantitatively studying collective motion in humans, framed as a game with an unspecified task and a group feedback mechanism, that can be solved through cooperation by 10 participants moving together. More than half of the groups participating in the experiment succeeded in achieving flocking motion, and winning players showed higher connectedness to others compared to those who failed. Furthermore, individuals with an awareness of working strategies were more likely to be part of winning groups, suggesting the importance of individual contributions to the collective task. This work demonstrates that solving an unspecified group challenge in response to group feedback is possible, and moreover, that flock-like collective movement has the potential to yield social benefits and well-being, suggesting new directions for exploring social aspects of consciousness and cognition."

According to the associative theory, creativity involves connecting distant concepts in semantic memory. Here, we explore how semantic memory changes following an educational intervention intended to promote creativity. Specifically, we examine how a scientific education curriculum—Scientific Creativity in Practice (SCIP) program—impacts the semantic memory networks of 10–18-year-old students in a chemistry class (n = 176). Students in an Intervention group who received the SCIP intervention, and a Control group who did not, completed creative thinking tests, as well as verbal fluency tasks to estimate semantic networks in science-specific (chemistry) and domain-general (animal) categories. Results showed that the SCIP intervention significantly improved fluency scores on a general creative thinking test. Using network science methods, we observed increased interconnectedness in both science-specific and domain-general categories, with lower path distances between concepts and reduced modularity. These traits define a ‘small-world’ network, balancing connections between closely related and remote concepts. Notably, the chemistry semantic network showed substantially more reorganization, consistent with the chemistry contents of the SCIP intervention. The findings suggest that semantic memory reorganization may be a cognitive mechanism underlying successful creativity interventions in science education."

Analyzing data from over 4,000  children (50% girls), we observe that less traditionally organized households correlate with  higher preschool academic achievement, irrespective of income or parental education.  However, by 1st-grade (Mage=6.6), boys' math performance becomes independent of family organization, widening gender gaps favoring boys in traditionally structured families. These  findings suggest that family environment contributes to math gender differences. However,  traditional family organizations do not necessarily lead to gender-stereotypical activities in  children. Furthermore, sex differences in 1st-grade math scores were not mediated by differences in gendered activities."

The focus of this narrative review is to address the primary methodological issues including investigator decision points in the application of rsfMRI to study the consequences of TBI. As part of the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group, we have collaborated to identify a minimum set of recommendations that are designed to produce results that are reliable, harmonizable, and reproducible for the TBI imaging research community. Part one of this review provides the results of a literature search of current rsfMRI studies of TBI, highlighting key design considerations and data processing pipelines. Part two outlines seven data acquisition, processing, and analysis recommendations with the goal of maximizing study reliability and between-site comparability, while preserving investigator autonomy. Part three summarizes new directions and opportunities for future rsfMRI studies in TBI patients, such as (i) integrated network analyses to examine the direct relationship between alterations in structural and functional connectivity; (ii) dealing with heterogeneous lesions in the rsfMRI analyses; and (iii) single-subject profiling of functional connectivity for making inferences at the single subject level in relation to a reference population. The goal is to galvanize the TBI community to gain consensus for a set of rigorous and reproducible methods, and to increase analytical transparency and data sharing to address the reproducibility crisis in the field."

Findings were consistent across multiple independent datasets and rhythm subskills (including beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination), and aggregate meta-analyzed data showed that rhythm impairment is a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders (OR = 1.32 [1.14 – 1.49]; p &lt; .0001).

However, as we delve deeper into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it becomes imperative to move beyond mere comparison (e.g., how AI compares to humans across a range of tasks) to establish a visionary agenda for AI as collaborative partners in the pursuit of knowledge and scientific inquiry. This paper articulates an agenda that envisions AI models as the preeminent scientific collaborators. We advocate for the profound notion that our thinking should evolve to anticipate, and include, AI models as one of the most impactful tools in the social scientist's toolbox, offering assistance and collaboration with low-level tasks (e.g., analysis and interpretation of research findings) and high-level tasks (e.g., the discovery of new academic frontiers) alike. This transformation requires us to imagine AI's possible/probable roles in the research process. We discuss the prospect of AI as active knowledge generators within the scientific community — agents who participate in the scientific journey, aiming to make complex human issues more tractable and comprehensible. We foresee AI tools acting as co-researchers, contributing to research proposals and driving breakthrough discoveries. Ethical considerations are paramount, encompassing democratizing access to AI tools, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and privacy in AI-driven research, and addressing limitations and biases in large language models. Embracing AI as collaborative partners will revolutionize the landscape of social sciences, enabling innovative, inclusive, and ethically sound research practices."

While rsfMRI holds unparalleled promise in systems neurosciences, its acquisition and analytical methodology across research groups is variable, resulting in a literature that is challenging to integrate and interpret. The focus of this narrative review is to address the primary methodological issues including investigator decision points in the application of rsfMRI to study the consequences of TBI. As part of the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group, we have collaborated to identify a minimum set of recommendations that are designed to produce results that are reliable, harmonizable, and reproducible for the TBI imaging research community. Part one of this review provides the results of a literature search of current rsfMRI studies of TBI, highlighting key design considerations and data processing pipelines. Part two outlines seven data acquisition, processing, and analysis recommendations with the goal of maximizing study reliability and between-site comparability, while preserving investigator autonomy. Part three summarizes new directions and opportunities for future rsfMRI studies in TBI patients, such as (i) integrated network analyses to examine the direct relationship between alterations in structural and functional connectivity; (ii) dealing with heterogeneous lesions in the rsfMRI analyses; and (iii) single-subject profiling of functional connectivity for making inferences at the single subject level in relation to a reference population. The goal is to galvanize the TBI community to gain consensus for a set of rigorous and reproducible methods, and to increase analytical transparency and data sharing to address the reproducibility crisis in the field."

Here, we used hyperalignment to compare visual responses in inferior temporal cortex between observers viewing identical stimuli. We find that individual eye movements enhance cortical visual responses, but also lead to representational divergence. Pairwise differences in gaze predict pairwise representational divergence, suggesting that individual gaze sculpts individual visual worlds."

Analyzing data from over 4,000  children (50% girls), we observe that less traditionally organized households correlate with  higher preschool academic achievement, irrespective of income or parental education.  However, by 1st-grade (Mage=6.6), boys' math performance becomes independent of family organization, widening gender gaps favoring boys in traditionally structured families. These  findings suggest that family environment contributes to math gender differences. However,  traditional family organizations do not necessarily lead to gender-stereotypical activities in  children. Furthermore, sex differences in 1st-grade math scores were not mediated by differences in gendered activities."

Boyd, Kate Blackburn","The social sciences have long relied on comparative work as the foundation upon which we understand the complexities of human behavior and society. However, as we delve deeper into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it becomes imperative to move beyond mere comparison (e.g., how AI compares to humans across a range of tasks) to establish a visionary agenda for AI as collaborative partners in the pursuit of knowledge and scientific inquiry. This paper articulates an agenda that envisions AI models as the preeminent scientific collaborators. We advocate for the profound notion that our thinking should evolve to anticipate, and include, AI models as one of the most impactful tools in the social scientist's toolbox, offering assistance and collaboration with low-level tasks (e.g., analysis and interpretation of research findings) and high-level tasks (e.g., the discovery of new academic frontiers) alike. This transformation requires us to imagine AI's possible/probable roles in the research process. We discuss the prospect of AI as active knowledge generators within the scientific community — agents who participate in the scientific journey, aiming to make complex human issues more tractable and comprehensible. We foresee AI tools acting as co-researchers, contributing to research proposals and driving breakthrough discoveries. Ethical considerations are paramount, encompassing democratizing access to AI tools, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and privacy in AI-driven research, and addressing limitations and biases in large language models. Embracing AI as collaborative partners will revolutionize the landscape of social sciences, enabling innovative, inclusive, and ethically sound research practices."

According to the associative theory, creativity involves connecting distant concepts in semantic memory. Here, we explore how semantic memory changes following an educational intervention intended to promote creativity. Specifically, we examine how a scientific education curriculum—Scientific Creativity in Practice (SCIP) program—impacts the semantic memory networks of 10–18-year-old students in a chemistry class (n = 176). Students in an Intervention group who received the SCIP intervention, and a Control group who did not, completed creative thinking tests, as well as verbal fluency tasks to estimate semantic networks in science-specific (chemistry) and domain-general (animal) categories. Results showed that the SCIP intervention significantly improved fluency scores on a general creative thinking test. Using network science methods, we observed increased interconnectedness in both science-specific and domain-general categories, with lower path distances between concepts and reduced modularity. These traits define a ‘small-world’ network, balancing connections between closely related and remote concepts. Notably, the chemistry semantic network showed substantially more reorganization, consistent with the chemistry contents of the SCIP intervention. The findings suggest that semantic memory reorganization may be a cognitive mechanism underlying successful creativity interventions in science education."

Prior work examining their relationship has primarily used small samples; here, we studied associations at population-scale by conducting the largest systematic epidemiological investigation to date (total N = 39,092). Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we predicted that rhythm impairment would be a significant risk factor for speech-language disorders in the general adult population. Findings were consistent across multiple independent datasets and rhythm subskills (including beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination), and aggregate meta-analyzed data showed that rhythm impairment is a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders (OR = 1.32 [1.14 – 1.49]; p &lt; .0001). Further, cross-trait polygenic score analyses indicate shared genetic architecture between musical rhythm and reading abilities, providing evidence for genetic pleiotropy between rhythm and language-related phenotypes."

In this study, I investigated the beliefs and attitudes that students have about grade weights (i.e., % of grade things are worth) by having them select grade weights for grade components and select their preferences for proportional or inversely proportional grade weights depending on assignment characteristics. Students ended up choosing grade weights that benefited their grades. Students who do not do well on exams choose a lower maximum grade weight for exams. Most students preferred grade weights to be proportional to time spent, difficulty, and length of assignments, while inversely proportional to strictness of grading. Overall, these results show that students would like grades to reflect the effort they put in. While they do not mind the difficulty of assignments, they do care whether something will be graded strictly."

This study investigated the relationship between social camouflaging, life satisfaction, and depression symptoms in Polish women with ADHD. It aimed to fill a research gap in understanding ADHD manifestations in women, particularly focusing on social camouflaging—a concept known in autism, referring to strategies used to mask symptoms in social interactions. Methods: A total of 329 women with ADHD took part in an online survey. The survey measured ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-vI.I), life satisfaction with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Additionally, a novel set of questions, inspired by the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) but tailored for ADHD, was utilized to assess social camouflaging. Results: Results indicated a significant negative association between social camouflaging and life satisfaction and a positive correlation with depressive symptoms, even after controlling for demographic variables. Additionally, factors like being in a relationship and having a positive financial perception correlated with higher well-being. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures, the cross-sectional design, and participants' self-reported ADHD diagnosis are the main limitations of the study. Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of social camouflaging in understanding ADHD in women, suggesting that efforts to mask symptoms and meet societal expectations may link to lower life satisfaction and increased depressive symptoms. These findings advocate for continued research into these dynamics to develop more effective support for women with ADHD."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tgn9q,2024-02-27,Syntax Before Words—The Function-First Approach to the Evolution of Proto-Language,To be fetched,"One of the most captivating unsolved problems in cognitive science and evolutionary anthropology is the question of how humans evolved into linguistic beings. Conventionally, it has been assumed that the problem of the origin of language could be formulated as how the gap between animal communication and human language was bridged. I argue, however, that this assumption is misleading. The precursor to language does not lie in animal communication, but rather in a specific form of animal cognition observed in many species. The paper argues that the cognitive architecture informing linguistic syntax is grounded in action-based event perception. This shifts the central research question away from how to bridge the gap between animal signaling and linguistic communication towards understanding the difference between agent-based event cognition and propositional communication that utilizes this cognitive architecture. This perspective allows for the application of standard evolutionary theory in the form of the function-first approach, as the new perspective suggests that language initially evolved for communicating displaced agent-based events. In addition to this methodological proposal, the paper offers an evolutionary rationale for the initial transition towards primitive propositional communication, which eschews the use of arbitrary signs. In this scenario, syntax is represented by the inferred relations of present objects symbolizing thematic roles: the communicator represents the agent, a natural sign (e.g., a displayed hunted animal) symbolizes the patient, and the action is either implied by the status of the patient or additionally co-referentially expressed through a mimetic gesture. The evaluation of the proposal reveals that the evolutionary narrative produced by the function-first approach to language evolution inherently addresses key challenges such as trust and cooperation; since the function-first approach to language evolution posits that language emerged in a scenario closely related to the emergence of human cooperation. Furthermore, the findings suggest compatibility with numerous existing theories on human evolution, bridging the gap between hypotheses that emphasize social interaction—such as the Social Brain Hypothesis and sexual selection—and those emphasizing environmental shifts in East Africa—such as the Savanna Hypothesis, the Variability Selection or Pulse Climate Hypothesis and Dietary Shift or Hunting Hypothesis."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f4dz6,2024-02-27,Raising awareness isn’t enough: The role of the psychology of education in disability-related justice and inclusion in primary classrooms,To be fetched,"What: When it comes to education, disability inequality is arguably a structural and systemic issue. The social model of disability, enshrined in teacher education programmes in the UK espouses the ways in which school environments rather than disabled children themselves, need to adapt and change. However, the role of psychology in addressing disability-related systemic injustice is less clear. The aim of this paper is to consider the potential role of the psychology of education in working towards disability justice in schools.   Why? Many inclusive teacher-education programmes set out the ways in which environments may be created to include disabled children. Psychologists have focused on disabled children’s needs to access and participate in the classroom, but often do not consider their exclusion in social model terms, from curriculum materials, classroom displays, or material culture more generally. Favazza and colleagues (e.g. 2017) now offer a sizeable body of research showing that disability representation in school classrooms is negligible. This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."

Furthermore, there is a scarcity of academic literature discussing best practice in terms of research conducted (a) with children instead of adults, (b) within school settings, or (c) addressing ableism and disability-based prejudice. This paper seeks to fill this gap by sharing insights gained from our own research project. We collected qualitative data through story stem completion tasks to explore perceptions and discourse surrounding disability among N = 195 children aged 5 – 11 years in the UK. We explain and critically assess our research decisions, including the creation of story stems, remote and indirect engagement with pupils and school staff, and our data collection methods. In doing so, we highlight the array of choices available to researchers, emphasize the importance of further dialogue within the research community, and advocate for evidence-based best practices in this specific research area."

Consistent with theory and prior research, immigrants reported lower life satisfaction than natives on average, while the size of the life satisfaction gap varied substantially across individuals and countries. Low neuroticism and high extraversion reduced the life satisfaction gap, suggesting that these personality traits may serve as internal resources for immigrants when faced with migration-related stressors. In contrast, we found a wider life satisfaction gap between immigrants and natives in high-income countries, suggesting that economic disparities between immigrants and natives in prosperous nations may contribute to the observed life satisfaction gap."

Consistent with theory and prior research, immigrants reported lower life satisfaction than natives on average, while the size of the life satisfaction gap varied substantially across individuals and countries. Low neuroticism and high extraversion reduced the life satisfaction gap, suggesting that these personality traits may serve as internal resources for immigrants when faced with migration-related stressors. In contrast, we found a wider life satisfaction gap between immigrants and natives in high-income countries, suggesting that economic disparities between immigrants and natives in prosperous nations may contribute to the observed life satisfaction gap."

The social model of disability, enshrined in teacher education programmes in the UK espouses the ways in which school environments rather than disabled children themselves, need to adapt and change. However, the role of psychology in addressing disability-related systemic injustice is less clear. The aim of this paper is to consider the potential role of the psychology of education in working towards disability justice in schools.   Why? Many inclusive teacher-education programmes set out the ways in which environments may be created to include disabled children. Psychologists have focused on disabled children’s needs to access and participate in the classroom, but often do not consider their exclusion in social model terms, from curriculum materials, classroom displays, or material culture more generally. Favazza and colleagues (e.g. 2017) now offer a sizeable body of research showing that disability representation in school classrooms is negligible. This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tgn9q,2024-02-27,Syntax Before Words—The Function-First Approach to the Evolution of Proto-Language,Till Nikolaus von Heiseler,"One of the most captivating unsolved problems in cognitive science and evolutionary anthropology is the question of how humans evolved into linguistic beings. Conventionally, it has been assumed that the problem of the origin of language could be formulated as how the gap between animal communication and human language was bridged. I argue, however, that this assumption is misleading. The precursor to language does not lie in animal communication, but rather in a specific form of animal cognition observed in many species. The paper argues that the cognitive architecture informing linguistic syntax is grounded in action-based event perception. This shifts the central research question away from how to bridge the gap between animal signaling and linguistic communication towards understanding the difference between agent-based event cognition and propositional communication that utilizes this cognitive architecture. This perspective allows for the application of standard evolutionary theory in the form of the function-first approach, as the new perspective suggests that language initially evolved for communicating displaced agent-based events. In addition to this methodological proposal, the paper offers an evolutionary rationale for the initial transition towards primitive propositional communication, which eschews the use of arbitrary signs. In this scenario, syntax is represented by the inferred relations of present objects symbolizing thematic roles: the communicator represents the agent, a natural sign (e.g., a displayed hunted animal) symbolizes the patient, and the action is either implied by the status of the patient or additionally co-referentially expressed through a mimetic gesture. The evaluation of the proposal reveals that the evolutionary narrative produced by the function-first approach to language evolution inherently addresses key challenges such as trust and cooperation; since the function-first approach to language evolution posits that language emerged in a scenario closely related to the emergence of human cooperation. Furthermore, the findings suggest compatibility with numerous existing theories on human evolution, bridging the gap between hypotheses that emphasize social interaction—such as the Social Brain Hypothesis and sexual selection—and those emphasizing environmental shifts in East Africa—such as the Savanna Hypothesis, the Variability Selection or Pulse Climate Hypothesis and Dietary Shift or Hunting Hypothesis."

This study investigated the relationship between social camouflaging, life satisfaction, and depression symptoms in Polish women with ADHD. It aimed to fill a research gap in understanding ADHD manifestations in women, particularly focusing on social camouflaging—a concept known in autism, referring to strategies used to mask symptoms in social interactions. Methods: A total of 329 women with ADHD took part in an online survey. The survey measured ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS-vI.I), life satisfaction with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Additionally, a novel set of questions, inspired by the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) but tailored for ADHD, was utilized to assess social camouflaging. Results: Results indicated a significant negative association between social camouflaging and life satisfaction and a positive correlation with depressive symptoms, even after controlling for demographic variables. Additionally, factors like being in a relationship and having a positive financial perception correlated with higher well-being. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures, the cross-sectional design, and participants' self-reported ADHD diagnosis are the main limitations of the study. Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of social camouflaging in understanding ADHD in women, suggesting that efforts to mask symptoms and meet societal expectations may link to lower life satisfaction and increased depressive symptoms. These findings advocate for continued research into these dynamics to develop more effective support for women with ADHD."

However, there has been limited systematic exploration of the disability represented in hate crime scenarios, and of responses of disabled people1. We surveyed N= 467 adults online, presenting them with disability-based hate crime scenarios. We orthogonally changed the disability of the hate crime target (deaf person or wheelchair user) across Hungary, Italy, Nordic countries, and the UK. We measured responses and intentions, direct contact with disabled people, identification as disabled, and reasons for their responses. Results showed cross-national differences, and increased helping intentions among disabled participants. Path analyses showed that anger and anxiety significantly mediated the association between direct contact with disabled people and helping intentions. Qualitative template analysis showed that helping and avoidance intentions from disabled and non-disabled people are motivated by a variety of reasons."

Furthermore, there is a scarcity of academic literature discussing best practice in terms of research conducted (a) with children instead of adults, (b) within school settings, or (c) addressing ableism and disability-based prejudice. This paper seeks to fill this gap by sharing insights gained from our own research project. We collected qualitative data through story stem completion tasks to explore perceptions and discourse surrounding disability among N = 195 children aged 5 – 11 years in the UK. We explain and critically assess our research decisions, including the creation of story stems, remote and indirect engagement with pupils and school staff, and our data collection methods. In doing so, we highlight the array of choices available to researchers, emphasize the importance of further dialogue within the research community, and advocate for evidence-based best practices in this specific research area."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8gwpr,2024-02-27,Burbidge_Feb2024_IBMSchoolTransition,To be fetched,"Identity-based motivation theory predicts that how well students do in school and how certain they are of attaining their school-focused possible identities recursively interact with what they infer when school tasks and goals feel hard to think about or do. Recursivity implies bidirectionality, but studies to date focus on unidirectional paths. To address this gap, we devised a three-time-point, two-month study during a secondary school transition (Chinese students N=818, Mage=12, 44% female). We obtained prior grades (T0) and placement test scores (T1+) and asked whether secondary school placement fit student preference (T2+). Students filled out questionnaires at critical junctures: a month before the placement test (T1), the day test results were announced (T2), and after learning their school placement (T3). Structural equation model results show both recursive and unidirectional paths. The recursive paths are between school-focused possible identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-importance (inferring value when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do) and school achievement; the unidirectional path is between identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-impossibility (inferring self-irrelevance when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do). T1 school-focused possible identity certainty boosted T1+ placement test scores and T2 difficulty-as-importance (controlling for T0 grades, T1 difficulty-as-importance respectively); T1 difficulty-as-importance boosted T2 school-focused possible identity certainty (controlling for T1 school-focused possible identity certainty). T1+ test scores boosted T2 difficulty-as-importance; T2 difficulty-as-importance boosted T3 school-focused possible identity certainty. Lower T1 school-focused possible identity certainty carries over to higher T2 difficulty-as-impossibility (controlling for T1 difficulty-as-impossibility) and this process recurs from T2 to T3."

A Longitudinal Study of Czech Adolescents to Differentiate Within- and Between-Person Effects,To be fetched,"The associations between violent video games (VVG) and both aggression and empathy have been examined in numerous studies. VVG are often depicted as triggers for increased aggression and decreased empathy in line with the General Aggression Model. However, longitudinal evidence that implements more than three waves, distinguishes within- and between-person effects, incorporates an independent assessment of violence, and focuses on various dimensions of aggression and empathy remains scarce. Drawing on a representative sample of 3,010 Czech adolescents (aged 13-17), data were collected over four waves (at six-month intervals) to measure physical and verbal aggression, and cognitive and affective empathy. VVG was evaluated based on participants' open-ended responses. To differentiate within- and between-person associations, a (multi-group) random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was employed. At the between-person level, VVG positively correlated with cognitive empathy, verbal aggression, and physical aggression. At the within-person level, two hypotheses were examined: the selection effect, which investigated the effects of changes in aggression/empathy on changes in VVG; and the desensitization effect, which explored the effects of changes in VVG on alterations in aggression/empathy. All desensitization effects were statistically insignificant. Regarding selection effects, an increase in affective empathy was linked to a decrease in VVG. Conversely, an increase in physical aggression was associated with an increase in VVG, both positively and negatively, depending on the wave of data collection. Furthermore, the moderation effects of age and gender were tested at both levels. The findings challenge the portrayal of VVG as a significant contributor to heightened aggression and decreased empathy in adolescents."

Methods: This single-site parallel stratified clinical trial (2x2; hearing device, communication mode) enrolled 96 parent-child dyads. Child inclusion criteria were: (a) between 12-18 months, (b) diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss, (c) no additional diagnoses, (d) had one parent with normal hearing, and (e) exposed to some degree of spoken language by their parents. Dyads were randomized to the control group or the PICT group, which taught parents to use communication support strategies (i.e., engagement strategies, primary language strategies, and supplemental language strategies) weekly via telehealth for 6 months. Parents’ strategy use was measured before, during, and immediately after intervention. Child communication outcomes were measured before and immediately after intervention.   Results: Results demonstrated a significant serial mediation of the effect of PICT on child communication outcomes through parents’ use of engagement strategies and primary language strategies.  Conclusion: Parents in the PICT condition learned  to use engagement strategies, which in turn, facilitated their implementation of primary language strategies, ultimately leading to an improvement in child communication outcomes. Understanding the active ingredients and causal pathway of the PICT is an important consideration for implementation of the PICT in clinical practice."

Results: Parent strategy use (d = 1.614) and child communication (d = 0.635) were greater for participants in the PICT group. The intervention effect on child communication was significantly greater for children exposed to sign language than children exposed to spoken language (B = 18.929, SE = 8.094, p = 0.019). Conclusion: PICT effectively facilitates parent strategy use and child communication. Sign language, more specifically sign-supported speech, may increase the benefits of PICT and, as such, future research should explore the systematic inclusion of sign-supported speech within the context of early interventions for DHH toddlers."

Using a longitudinal dataset of annual government reports from 31 provinces between 2007 and 2021, we found that cultural tightness and government innovation initiatives positively impacted general and incremental innovation but not radical innovation. The nationwide campaign modified the relationship between tightness/looseness and innovation initiatives, with tightness' negative moderating effect diminishing after the campaign. Additionally, innovation initiatives significantly affected all innovation types only after the campaign, while the interaction between looseness and innovation initiatives changed from positive to negative. These results emphasize the importance of examining the interplay between cultural factors and government policies in fostering different forms of innovation and highlight the influence of nationwide campaigns on local government policies for driving innovation outcomes."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fp4dq,2024-02-27,Reaching the cognitive-motor interface: Cognitive load diminishes arm choice efficiency and motor performance in neurotypicals and individuals with stroke,To be fetched,"Daily life requires use of the arms for a variety of tasks under competing cognitive demands, such as reaching for objects in a visually-cluttered kitchen cabinet while holding a conversation. Prior studies have suggested that such demands may impact motor performance, including selection of the most efficient arm to use to reach to a target in a given location. The research conducted here expands upon prior studies by 1) examining the role of cognitive load in arm choice efficiency using a novel virtual reality paradigm designed to mimic the demands of real-life visual search, object selection, and reaching to targets, and 2) examining the impact of such demands on motor performance in individuals with stroke. To manipulate cognitive demand, we varied the semantic similarity of objects in the reaching space and the presence or absence of a secondary task. We hypothesized that cognitive load would modulate efficiency of arm choice and performance in both neurotypicals and individuals with stroke. The results showed reduced efficiency of arm choice for the stroke and neurotypical control groups under increased demand.  Under cognitive load, participants with stroke also showed slower reach initiation, slower movements, increased reach curvature, and increased performance differences between the paretic and non-paretic arms. These data indicate that cognitive factors influence arm choice efficiency in naturalistic reaching tasks in neurotypical individuals, and both arm choice efficiency and motor performance in stroke. Efficiency and performance decrements under cognitive load may in turn influence reduced use of the paretic arm during daily activities."

However, the mechanisms of social cognitive dysfunction in SZ remain poorly understood, which impedes the design of novel interventions to improve outcomes. This pre-registered project (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JH5FC) examines the representation of social functioning in the brain’s functional architecture across early psychosis (EP) and SZ. The study contains two parts: a confirmatory and an exploratory portion. In the confirmatory portion, we identified specific resting-state brain connectivity disruptions evident in EP and SZ. We performed a seed-based connectivity analysis using brain regions associated with social cognitive dysfunction in SZ (based on a published review) to test whether aberrant functional connectivity observed in SZ was also present in EP. In the exploratory portion, we assessed the out-of-sample generalizability and precision of resting state connectivity-based predictive models of social cognition. We used machine learning to predict social cognition from whole-brain connectomes and established the generalizability of these brain-behavior relationships with out-of-sample testing and cross-validation (to handle confounding variables). Results reveal significant decreases between the left inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus that were evident in SZ but not EP. This connectivity profile is significantly associated with social cognition/functioning in both SZ and EP. Null predictive modeling results reveal the importance of out-of-sample evaluation, proper null hypothesis testing, and confound removal procedures. Overall, this work provides insights into the brain's functional architecture in SZ and EP. This work suggests that IFG-IPS connectivity profiles could be an important prognostic biomarker of social impairments and may be a target for future interventions focused on improved treatment outcomes related to social functioning."

Few empirical studies, however, have examined adolescents’ daily negative and positive experiences on SM and its proximal impacts on suicidal ideation (SI), particularly using intensive monitoring designs.  Method: Adolescents (N= 60; 14-17 years; 49% girls; 62% LGBTQ+) recruited using SM across the United States and participated in an 8-week intensive monitoring protocol. Ecological momentary assessment (3 brief surveys per day) asked about negative and positive SM experiences and SI (passive and active). Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the within-person relationships between daily SM experiences (e.g., individual fluctuations compared to a person’s average) and SI, controlling for average levels of SM experiences, SM use screen time, and lifetime SI.  Results: Significant within-person effects of negative and positive SM experiences were associated with days when adolescents had SI. Specifically, on days when teens endorsed more frequent negative SM experiences than usual, they were more likely to report SI. However, more positive SM experiences than usual were associated with a lower likelihood of having SI. There were no significant effects of SM use (“screen time”) on SI or on the reverse associations of SI on next-day SM experiences.   Conclusions: Results indicate that SM experiences may be dynamic and modifiable risk and protective factors for SI in adolescents, whereas there is no effect of SM screen time on SI. Our results highlight that targeting negative SM experiences and augmenting the positive experiences on SM may be critical targets to improve teens’ mental health and prevent suicide, rather than focusing on limiting SM screen time."

Yet in humans, most group behaviour is often attributed to explicit central control or social norms, rather than to synergistic interplay between individuals. Here we introduce Synch.Live, a participatory behavioural science experiment for quantitatively studying collective motion in humans, framed as a game with an unspecified task and a group feedback mechanism, that can be solved through cooperation by 10 participants moving together. More than half of the groups participating in the experiment succeeded in achieving flocking motion, and winning players showed higher connectedness to others compared to those who failed. Furthermore, individuals with an awareness of working strategies were more likely to be part of winning groups, suggesting the importance of individual contributions to the collective task. This work demonstrates that solving an unspecified group challenge in response to group feedback is possible, and moreover, that flock-like collective movement has the potential to yield social benefits and well-being, suggesting new directions for exploring social aspects of consciousness and cognition."

Null predictive modeling results reveal the importance of out-of-sample evaluation, proper null hypothesis testing, and confound removal procedures. Overall, this work provides insights into the brain's functional architecture in SZ and EP. This work suggests that IFG-IPS connectivity profiles could be an important prognostic biomarker of social impairments and may be a target for future interventions focused on improved treatment outcomes related to social functioning."

Jacob, Shailesh S. Kantak, Laurel Buxbaum","Daily life requires use of the arms for a variety of tasks under competing cognitive demands, such as reaching for objects in a visually-cluttered kitchen cabinet while holding a conversation. Prior studies have suggested that such demands may impact motor performance, including selection of the most efficient arm to use to reach to a target in a given location. The research conducted here expands upon prior studies by 1) examining the role of cognitive load in arm choice efficiency using a novel virtual reality paradigm designed to mimic the demands of real-life visual search, object selection, and reaching to targets, and 2) examining the impact of such demands on motor performance in individuals with stroke. To manipulate cognitive demand, we varied the semantic similarity of objects in the reaching space and the presence or absence of a secondary task. We hypothesized that cognitive load would modulate efficiency of arm choice and performance in both neurotypicals and individuals with stroke. The results showed reduced efficiency of arm choice for the stroke and neurotypical control groups under increased demand.  Under cognitive load, participants with stroke also showed slower reach initiation, slower movements, increased reach curvature, and increased performance differences between the paretic and non-paretic arms. These data indicate that cognitive factors influence arm choice efficiency in naturalistic reaching tasks in neurotypical individuals, and both arm choice efficiency and motor performance in stroke. Efficiency and performance decrements under cognitive load may in turn influence reduced use of the paretic arm during daily activities."

Hamilton, Maya Dalack, Simone Imani Boyd, Jorgensen, Saskia Linnea, Melissa J. Dreier, Jas Sarna, David Brent","Background: Social media (SM) has received considerable attention as a potential risk factor for adolescent suicide. Few empirical studies, however, have examined adolescents’ daily negative and positive experiences on SM and its proximal impacts on suicidal ideation (SI), particularly using intensive monitoring designs.  Method: Adolescents (N= 60; 14-17 years; 49% girls; 62% LGBTQ+) recruited using SM across the United States and participated in an 8-week intensive monitoring protocol. Ecological momentary assessment (3 brief surveys per day) asked about negative and positive SM experiences and SI (passive and active). Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the within-person relationships between daily SM experiences (e.g., individual fluctuations compared to a person’s average) and SI, controlling for average levels of SM experiences, SM use screen time, and lifetime SI.  Results: Significant within-person effects of negative and positive SM experiences were associated with days when adolescents had SI. Specifically, on days when teens endorsed more frequent negative SM experiences than usual, they were more likely to report SI. However, more positive SM experiences than usual were associated with a lower likelihood of having SI. There were no significant effects of SM use (“screen time”) on SI or on the reverse associations of SI on next-day SM experiences.   Conclusions: Results indicate that SM experiences may be dynamic and modifiable risk and protective factors for SI in adolescents, whereas there is no effect of SM screen time on SI. Our results highlight that targeting negative SM experiences and augmenting the positive experiences on SM may be critical targets to improve teens’ mental health and prevent suicide, rather than focusing on limiting SM screen time."

A Longitudinal Study of Czech Adolescents to Differentiate Within- and Between-Person Effects,"David Lacko, Hana Machackova, David Smahel","The associations between violent video games (VVG) and both aggression and empathy have been examined in numerous studies. VVG are often depicted as triggers for increased aggression and decreased empathy in line with the General Aggression Model. However, longitudinal evidence that implements more than three waves, distinguishes within- and between-person effects, incorporates an independent assessment of violence, and focuses on various dimensions of aggression and empathy remains scarce. Drawing on a representative sample of 3,010 Czech adolescents (aged 13-17), data were collected over four waves (at six-month intervals) to measure physical and verbal aggression, and cognitive and affective empathy. VVG was evaluated based on participants' open-ended responses. To differentiate within- and between-person associations, a (multi-group) random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was employed. At the between-person level, VVG positively correlated with cognitive empathy, verbal aggression, and physical aggression. At the within-person level, two hypotheses were examined: the selection effect, which investigated the effects of changes in aggression/empathy on changes in VVG; and the desensitization effect, which explored the effects of changes in VVG on alterations in aggression/empathy. All desensitization effects were statistically insignificant. Regarding selection effects, an increase in affective empathy was linked to a decrease in VVG. Conversely, an increase in physical aggression was associated with an increase in VVG, both positively and negatively, depending on the wave of data collection. Furthermore, the moderation effects of age and gender were tested at both levels. The findings challenge the portrayal of VVG as a significant contributor to heightened aggression and decreased empathy in adolescents."

Recursivity implies bidirectionality, but studies to date focus on unidirectional paths. To address this gap, we devised a three-time-point, two-month study during a secondary school transition (Chinese students N=818, Mage=12, 44% female). We obtained prior grades (T0) and placement test scores (T1+) and asked whether secondary school placement fit student preference (T2+). Students filled out questionnaires at critical junctures: a month before the placement test (T1), the day test results were announced (T2), and after learning their school placement (T3). Structural equation model results show both recursive and unidirectional paths. The recursive paths are between school-focused possible identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-importance (inferring value when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do) and school achievement; the unidirectional path is between identity certainty and belief in difficulty-as-impossibility (inferring self-irrelevance when schoolwork feels hard to think about or do). T1 school-focused possible identity certainty boosted T1+ placement test scores and T2 difficulty-as-importance (controlling for T0 grades, T1 difficulty-as-importance respectively); T1 difficulty-as-importance boosted T2 school-focused possible identity certainty (controlling for T1 school-focused possible identity certainty). T1+ test scores boosted T2 difficulty-as-importance; T2 difficulty-as-importance boosted T3 school-focused possible identity certainty. Lower T1 school-focused possible identity certainty carries over to higher T2 difficulty-as-impossibility (controlling for T1 difficulty-as-impossibility) and this process recurs from T2 to T3."

However, we argue that there has not been enough attention to the socio-cultural contexts of personality development, resulting in incomplete and potentially harmful interpretations of the data. Although personality theorists have addressed the role of socio-cultural context by pointing to person-environment interactions and transactions, we argue that the implementation of contextualism is largely missing at a more fundamental level: In the operationalization of constructs and interpretations of individuals’ standings on those constructs. The focus of this article is on the maturity principle of personality development. We discuss problems that may arise when relying on constructs developed in a specific group (i.e., primarily upper-middle class individuals in the United States), and then using value-laden labels such as “mature” and “healthy” to suggest that one personality profile is better than another. We aim to motivate researchers to not only reflect on using labels suggesting that certain profiles or changes in personality are universally desirable or undesirable, especially without attention to diversity in methods and samples, but also to understand how our values inform how we conduct and communicate our science."

While research has extensively studied multisensory integration (MSI) using idealised, well-controlled stimuli, there is a need to understand this process in response to complex, naturalistic stimuli encountered in everyday life. This study investigated behavioural and neuronal MSI in neurotypical adults experiencing audio-visual speech within a naturalistic, social context. Our novel paradigm incorporated a broader social situational context, complete words, and speech-supporting iconic gestures, allowing for context-based pragmatics and semantic priors. We investigated MSI in the presence of unimodal (auditory or visual) or complementary, bimodal speech signals. During audio-visual speech trials, compared to unimodal trials, participants more accurately recognised spoken words and showed a more pronounced suppression of alpha power—an indicator of heightened integration load. Importantly, on the neuronal level, these effects surpassed mere summation of unimodal responses, suggesting non-linear MSI mechanisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that typically developing adults integrate audio-visual speech and gesture information to facilitate speech comprehension in noisy environments, highlighting the importance of studying MSI in ecologically valid contexts."

This research focused on inequality perception across time. We predicted that people would underestimate present inequality levels, while being optimistic about past inequality, and pessimistic about future inequality. We assessed perception of present levels of inequality, and estimates of past and future inequality. Study 1 (N=354) was run in 2016 and estimates referred to 10 years before/after 2016. Study 2 (N=246) was run in 2021 and estimates referred to 5 years before/after 2021. In Study 1, a strong underestimation of present inequality emerged. Estimated future inequality was higher than estimation of present inequality, which in turn was significantly higher than perceived past inequality. Study 2 replicated these results partially, as past estimates of inequality which did not differ from present estimates. When comparing expectations for 2016 and 2026 across the two studies, no differences emerged - indicating that participants estimated on average similar scores for corresponding time stamps. Political orientation did not affect these results. This research confirms past literature on inequality underestimation, and shows that individuals are consistently pessimistic towards the future. This shared pessimism may lead left- and right-oriented individuals alike towards a generalized skepticism about redistributive efforts, and should therefore be addressed in future research."

The developmental transition to young adulthood involves social, psychological and physical change, which can be challenging. Adolescents living with chronic skin conditions may experience greater challenges than their healthy peers due to the potential addition of managing and coping with their condition. Using semi-structured interviews and an interpretative phenomenological approach, this study explored experiences of transition from adolescence to adulthood in the context of chronic skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa). Seven themes emerged: (1) The Medical Journey; (2) Practical Difficulties; (3) Physical Impacts; (4) Psychological Impacts; (5) Self-Conscious Emotions; (6) Stigma; and (7) Building Resilience. Our findings add to our understanding of the difficulties experienced by young people with chronic skin conditions, particularly during adolescence. Our findings also offer insight into how researchers and practitioners can support these young people throughout their developmental journey from adolescence into young adulthood."

In applied branding contexts, such dimensions are employed to find music that conveys core brand values. A practically small number of dimensions for consumers to rate music assets on are desirable and often derived based on factor analytic methods. However, often resulting factor analytic structures must be subjectively reinterpreted and analyses begin by discovering an a priori unknown number of latent variables in a dataset, or, if a desirable number of dimensions is requested, produces solutions with highly unequal component importances. Alternatively, we propose a machine learning approach to discovering useful dimensions in high-dimensional data: Diversity-Induced Self-Representation Feature Selection (D-ISR; Liu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, and Wang, 2017), a data-driven methodology which can transition between simple and complex representations of the same (emotional-semantic) space. With a large dataset (NParticipants = 55,593; NResponses = 5,820,188; NAudioTracks = 251), we use D-ISR to select 14 core attributes from a pool of 212. The subset can reconstruct the original multi- dimensional space of all 212 attributes with good reconstruction accuracy (Mean RMSE = 0.32 [0, 10]). Consequently, whilst good reconstruction accuracy cannot always be guaranteed, we demonstrate a principled approach for discovering any a priori number of features to represent a large dimensional space. Framed this way, the decision about whether to use N vs. N+1 features only marginally affects reconstruction error and hence has broad practical utility. The method can be generalised to similar domains (e.g., personality measurement)."

Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be self-structured by the people involved themselves. The latter hence vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. In the scientific study of executive functions, these different situations hence exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. To address the challenges of these type of situations, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses from the behaviour of the participants; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research which usually focus on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions."

Here, we asked whether people differentially focus their attention on semantic or perceptual information over development during memory retrieval. First, we trained a multivoxel classifier to characterize whole-brain neural patterns reflecting semantic versus perceptual attention in a cued attention task. We then used this classifier to quantify how attention varied in a separate dataset in which children, adolescents, and adults retrieved autobiographical, semantic, and episodic memories. All age groups demonstrated a semantic attentional bias during memory retrieval, with significant age differences in this bias during the semantic task. Trials began with a preparatory picture cue followed by a retrieval question, which allowed us to ask whether attentional biases varied by trial period. Adults showed a semantic bias earlier during the picture cues, whereas adolescents showed this bias during the question. Adults and adolescents also engaged different brain regions—superior parietal cortex and ventral visual regions, respectively—during preparatory picture cues. Our results demonstrate that retrieval-related attention undergoes refinement beyond childhood. These findings suggest that alongside expanding semantic knowledge, attention-related changes may support the maturation of factual knowledge retrieval."

As it is commonly known, attention allocation tends to increase both the cortical and the phenomenal response to the target. Yet, in deep contemplative states practitioners often report to feel a complete dissolution of body boundaries, i.e. the state of banga (in Pali). This phenomenon creates tension with existing literature on attention: How does attention decrease the perception of the sensory target instead of increasing it? This paper aims at solving the tension by examining computational, phenomenological, and embodied approaches to contemplative practices. For the sake of simplicity, the body-scan technique (Vipassana tradition) is taken as an exemplary practice that leads to the state of bhanga. This paper starts with the premise that the attentional processes are fundamentally interacting with somatic (i.e. bodily) processes and resulting subjective experience. Through a predictive processing account of the attentional processes of the body-scan, I propose that the body-scan enhances the accuracy of (low-level) predictions on somatosensory cues. This way, the resulting accurate posteriors accurately match the stream of ascendent prediction errors. Predictions matching predictions errors leads to what is called “(somato)sensory attenuation”, e.g. the attenuation of perceived (somato)sensory inputs. The “overly attenuated” body of the practitioner may render the phenomenology of the state of bhanga. Moreover, other effects of the body-scan on body perception are examined. By learning to flexibly update the model, the body-scan may allow better optimisation of the processing of sensory cues of the practitioner’s body. This explains the observed tendency of expert practitioners to develop increased body awareness. I conclude by addressing the relevance of contemplative practices for psychopathology, such as in cases of disrupted body awareness and depersonalisation. Finally, this paper also contributes significantly to embodied theories of cognition, as it further emphasises the role of somatic processes in the phenomenology of the self."

Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be self-structured by the people involved themselves. The latter hence vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. In the scientific study of executive functions, these different situations hence exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. To address the challenges of these type of situations, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses from the behaviour of the participants; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research which usually focus on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions."

McLean","A vast body of knowledge on development and correlates of personality dimensions has led to recommendations on policy implications and interventions. However, we argue that there has not been enough attention to the socio-cultural contexts of personality development, resulting in incomplete and potentially harmful interpretations of the data. Although personality theorists have addressed the role of socio-cultural context by pointing to person-environment interactions and transactions, we argue that the implementation of contextualism is largely missing at a more fundamental level: In the operationalization of constructs and interpretations of individuals’ standings on those constructs. The focus of this article is on the maturity principle of personality development. We discuss problems that may arise when relying on constructs developed in a specific group (i.e., primarily upper-middle class individuals in the United States), and then using value-laden labels such as “mature” and “healthy” to suggest that one personality profile is better than another. We aim to motivate researchers to not only reflect on using labels suggesting that certain profiles or changes in personality are universally desirable or undesirable, especially without attention to diversity in methods and samples, but also to understand how our values inform how we conduct and communicate our science."

This research focused on inequality perception across time. We predicted that people would underestimate present inequality levels, while being optimistic about past inequality, and pessimistic about future inequality. We assessed perception of present levels of inequality, and estimates of past and future inequality. Study 1 (N=354) was run in 2016 and estimates referred to 10 years before/after 2016. Study 2 (N=246) was run in 2021 and estimates referred to 5 years before/after 2021. In Study 1, a strong underestimation of present inequality emerged. Estimated future inequality was higher than estimation of present inequality, which in turn was significantly higher than perceived past inequality. Study 2 replicated these results partially, as past estimates of inequality which did not differ from present estimates. When comparing expectations for 2016 and 2026 across the two studies, no differences emerged - indicating that participants estimated on average similar scores for corresponding time stamps. Political orientation did not affect these results. This research confirms past literature on inequality underestimation, and shows that individuals are consistently pessimistic towards the future. This shared pessimism may lead left- and right-oriented individuals alike towards a generalized skepticism about redistributive efforts, and should therefore be addressed in future research."

While research has extensively studied multisensory integration (MSI) using idealised, well-controlled stimuli, there is a need to understand this process in response to complex, naturalistic stimuli encountered in everyday life. This study investigated behavioural and neuronal MSI in neurotypical adults experiencing audio-visual speech within a naturalistic, social context. Our novel paradigm incorporated a broader social situational context, complete words, and speech-supporting iconic gestures, allowing for context-based pragmatics and semantic priors. We investigated MSI in the presence of unimodal (auditory or visual) or complementary, bimodal speech signals. During audio-visual speech trials, compared to unimodal trials, participants more accurately recognised spoken words and showed a more pronounced suppression of alpha power—an indicator of heightened integration load. Importantly, on the neuronal level, these effects surpassed mere summation of unimodal responses, suggesting non-linear MSI mechanisms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that typically developing adults integrate audio-visual speech and gesture information to facilitate speech comprehension in noisy environments, highlighting the importance of studying MSI in ecologically valid contexts."

In the attraction effect, apparently irrelevant dominated decoys have proven effective in shifting preferences in numerous laboratory experiments, yet its relevance in real-life consumer choices remains disputed. Part of the problem lies in the differences between laboratory settings and realistic scenarios: in the lab, participants are typically tested on ternary choices, deliberately excluding any interference from other context effects; in contrast, in real life, consumers face choices among a high number of options, and interactions with other context effects are frequent. In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate how these factors modulate the attraction effect: in particular, we systematically manipulate the number of decoys (study1), and the number of options available to decision makers (study2). Our findings provide a rich map of the effects of asymmetrically dominated decoys in larger multialternative decision contexts, suggesting that: (i) the attraction effect remains significant for up to 5 options; (ii) two converging decoys are more effective than one, but (iii) adding more can undermine the effect; (iv) compromise options have a peculiar dampening influence on decoys, making them ineffective at targeting the intermediate option."

A number of studies have examined the human perception of topology — in particular, whether adults and young children perceive and differentiate objects based on features like closure, boundedness, and emptiness. Topology is about more than ‘wholes and holes’, however; it also offers an efficient language for representing network structure. Topological maps, common for subway systems across the world, are an example of how effective this language can be. Inspired by this idea, here we examine ‘intuitive network topology’. We first show that people readily differentiate objects based on several different features of topological networks. We then show that people both remember and match objects in accordance with their topology, over and above substantial variation in their surface features. These results demonstrate that humans possess an intuitive understanding for the basic topological features of networks, and hint at the possibility that topology may serve as a format for representing relations in the mind."

This studyaims to explore the effectiveness of VR therapy in reducing anxiety and improvingoverall well-being among children with ASD. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative assessments of anxiety levels and qualitative insights into the subjective experiences of participants. The quantitative aspect involved a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 100children aged 6 to 12 years diagnosed with ASD. Participants were randomly assignedtoeither the experimental group, which received VR therapy sessions, or the control group, which received standard therapy. Anxiety levels were measured using standardizedscales at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up assessments conducted one monthafter the intervention. Additionally, demographic information and baseline anxiety levels were collected to ensure comparability between the two groups. Preliminary findings indicate a significant reduction in anxiety levels among childrenwhounderwent VR therapy compared to those receiving standard therapy. The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anxiety scores frombaseline to post-intervention and maintained these improvements at the one-monthfollow-up. Conversely, the control group exhibited marginal changes in anxiety levels over the same period. Qualitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews with participants andtheir caregivers provided valuable insights into the subjective experiences of childrenundergoing VR therapy. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis includedenhanced engagement, reduced fear of social interaction, and increased feelings of empowerment and control. Participants reported a sense of immersion and enjoyment during VR sessions, describing them as engaging and interactive. The study also examined potential moderators and mediators of treatment outcomes, including age, gender, ASD severity, and presence of comorbid conditions. Subgroupanalyses revealed differential treatment effects based on these variables, with younger children and those with milder forms of ASD experiencing greater benefits fromVRtherapy. Overall, the findings suggest that VR therapy holds promise as an effective interventionfor reducing anxiety levels in children with ASD. Its immersive and interactive natureappears to engage participants and create a sense of presence, leading to significant improvements in anxiety symptoms. Future research should further explore the long- term effects of VR therapy and investigate its mechanisms of action to optimizetreatment protocols and enhance outcomes for children with ASD."

There is little research on the factors that influence perceived greenwashing amongst the public. Here, we report a replication and extension of one of the few studies of this topic, Experiment 2 in De Vries et al. (2015). The original study found that people perceived more greenwashing when an oil company communicated an environmental motive for a sustainability investment (carbon capture and storage), as opposed to a profit motive, d = 0.98 [0.37, 1.59]. The present pre-registered replication (n = 516) did not find support for this effect, with very little difference in perceived greenwashing depending on communicated motive, d = -0.09 [-0.38, 0.21].

The most noteworthy exploratory finding was that attitudes were more positive when an environmental or a mixed motive was communicated rather than a profit motive."

Methods: Data for this study were from the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS, n = 1135). A polygenic score (PGS) approach was used to index the genome-wide propensity for educational attainment. Multiple regression analyses examined interactions between polygenic propensity for educational attainment and positive affect on sleep. Pathway analysis examined relations between polygenic propensity for educational attainment, positive affect, sleep, and education.

Yet, despite its hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost-benefit decision-making. To examine this question, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when it was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two cognitive domains, and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role for the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost- benefit decision-making."

This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three novel indices as the first to simultaneously measure premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a nationally representative longitudinal U.S. sample of 27,986 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, we assessed racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated loss of family members over the lifespan. Hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative lifetime loss burden than White participants across all three indices. These effects consistently remained after sensitivity analyses controlling for sociodemographic variables such as parental education, household size, and birth cohort. Secondly, we provided initial construct validity evidence of our three indices by demonstrating their distinguishability from other measures of lifetime stressors and current, chronic stressors, presenting a case for attending to lifetime exposure to grief as a unique stressor. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to premature and cumulative death. The proposed novel measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health."

Despite ideas about the equivalence between MI and execution, the relationship between visual-motor experiences and MI ability is unclear. Here we evaluated how distinct experiences (i.e., no-vision physical and observational practice) impact visual and kinesthetic MI ability. Participants (N = 66) were randomized into three groups; no-vision physical practice, observational practice and no-practice control. Participants practiced and then visually and kinesthetically imagined two hand gesture sequences. Mental chronometry, a movement time (MT) congruency measure, and MI quality ratings were used to assess MI. As predicted, physical practice produced higher ratings for kinesthetic MI and observational practice elicited higher ratings for visual MI. However, physical practice did not result in greater temporal congruency between imagined/executed MTs in comparison to other groups. We conclude that MI is only partially tied to the motor representation as physical practice was not essential for enhancing MI quality. The motor representation developed with no-vision practice improved perceptions of kinesthetic MI, but without the expected congruence in timing, questioning the equivalence between execution and MI."

Prevailing research suggests that information’s valence plays a central role in shaping our self-views. However, the need for stability within the self-concept structure and the inherent alignment of positive feedback with the pre-existing self-views of healthy individuals might mask valence and congruence effects. In this study (N = 30, undergraduates) we orthogonalized feedback valence and self-congruence effects to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of self-relevant feedback processing and self-concept updating. We found that participants had a preference for integrating self-congruent and dismissing self-incongruent feedback, regardless of its valence. Consistently, EEG results revealed that feedback congruence, but not feedback valence, is swiftly detected during early processing stages. Our findings diverge from the accepted notion that self-concept updating is based on the selective incorporation of positive information. These findings offer novel insights into self-concept dynamics, with implications for the understanding of psychopathological conditions."

Both have also been claimed to enhance pupil’s cognitive and academic performances. However, existing research evidence is inconsistent in finding support for such claims and there are no studies directly comparing the two methods. Consequently, this study investigated the acute effects of lessons taught using PAL or incorporating MBs on pupil’s Cognitive and Academic Performances (AP) and PA Levels. METHOD: 355 children (aged 8-10 years) from three schools in Northern England participated in a cluster-randomised trial. Classes of pupils were assigned to participate in one of the three types of, 45 min long, mathematics lesson (Lesson-type: PAL, MB or Traditional). Physical activity during lessons was measured using accelerometery and pre- and post-lesson participants completed a battery of standardised assessments assessing of their Maths Fluency (measure of AP) and Cognitive (Attentional) Control. RESULTS: Compared to Traditional (sedentary) lessons, PAL and MB lessons were associated with pupils being significantly more Moderately to Vigorously Physically Active during lesson time (95% CI: +9.86 to 11.06 min). PAL lessons also reduced time spent sedentary by a significantly larger margin than lessons incorporating a MB (95% CI: -16.60 to 21.70 min). However, variation over time in Maths Fluency and Attentional Control measures were not significantly moderated by Lesson-Type, with Bayes Factors indicating evidence in favour of null hypothesis (All Time X Lesson-Type interactions had a BF10 ranging from 0.29 to 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Both PAL and MBs effectively increase student’s PA levels during curriculum time. These benefits do not come at the expense of academic or cognitive performances but neither do these outcomes appear acutely enhanced."

Background: White individuals are becoming numerical minorities in many Western European cities, despite persistent white supremacy. In this context, some white individuals embrace diversity, whereas others perceive it as a threat. Understanding white parents’ RES in diverse contexts is crucial, as parents play a pivotal role in shaping their children's beliefs and behaviors. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with 12 white German parents of elementary school aged children and employed reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: We identified four main themes: silence about race, adhering to white normativity, overtly reinforcing racism, and diversity socialization.  Conclusion: RES among white parents is a mechanism that can uphold or resist white supremacy.

This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three novel indices as the first to simultaneously measure premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a nationally representative longitudinal U.S. sample of 27,986 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, we assessed racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated loss of family members over the lifespan. Hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative lifetime loss burden than White participants across all three indices. These effects consistently remained after sensitivity analyses controlling for sociodemographic variables such as parental education, household size, and birth cohort. Secondly, we provided initial construct validity evidence of our three indices by demonstrating their distinguishability from other measures of lifetime stressors and current, chronic stressors, presenting a case for attending to lifetime exposure to grief as a unique stressor. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to premature and cumulative death. The proposed novel measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health."

Background: White individuals are becoming numerical minorities in many Western European cities, despite persistent white supremacy. In this context, some white individuals embrace diversity, whereas others perceive it as a threat. Understanding white parents’ RES in diverse contexts is crucial, as parents play a pivotal role in shaping their children's beliefs and behaviors. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with 12 white German parents of elementary school aged children and employed reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: We identified four main themes: silence about race, adhering to white normativity, overtly reinforcing racism, and diversity socialization.  Conclusion: RES among white parents is a mechanism that can uphold or resist white supremacy. All parents’ messaging included aspects of both, indicating an ongoing embrace of white normativity and supremacy in this superdiverse context, but also an emerging consciousness of own privileges.

Both have also been claimed to enhance pupil’s cognitive and academic performances. However, existing research evidence is inconsistent in finding support for such claims and there are no studies directly comparing the two methods. Consequently, this study investigated the acute effects of lessons taught using PAL or incorporating MBs on pupil’s Cognitive and Academic Performances (AP) and PA Levels. METHOD: 355 children (aged 8-10 years) from three schools in Northern England participated in a cluster-randomised trial. Classes of pupils were assigned to participate in one of the three types of, 45 min long, mathematics lesson (Lesson-type: PAL, MB or Traditional). Physical activity during lessons was measured using accelerometery and pre- and post-lesson participants completed a battery of standardised assessments assessing of their Maths Fluency (measure of AP) and Cognitive (Attentional) Control. RESULTS: Compared to Traditional (sedentary) lessons, PAL and MB lessons were associated with pupils being significantly more Moderately to Vigorously Physically Active during lesson time (95% CI: +9.86 to 11.06 min). PAL lessons also reduced time spent sedentary by a significantly larger margin than lessons incorporating a MB (95% CI: -16.60 to 21.70 min). However, variation over time in Maths Fluency and Attentional Control measures were not significantly moderated by Lesson-Type, with Bayes Factors indicating evidence in favour of null hypothesis (All Time X Lesson-Type interactions had a BF10 ranging from 0.29 to 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Both PAL and MBs effectively increase student’s PA levels during curriculum time. These benefits do not come at the expense of academic or cognitive performances but neither do these outcomes appear acutely enhanced."

Prevailing research suggests that information’s valence plays a central role in shaping our self-views. However, the need for stability within the self-concept structure and the inherent alignment of positive feedback with the pre-existing self-views of healthy individuals might mask valence and congruence effects. In this study (N = 30, undergraduates) we orthogonalized feedback valence and self-congruence effects to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of self-relevant feedback processing and self-concept updating. We found that participants had a preference for integrating self-congruent and dismissing self-incongruent feedback, regardless of its valence. Consistently, EEG results revealed that feedback congruence, but not feedback valence, is swiftly detected during early processing stages. Our findings diverge from the accepted notion that self-concept updating is based on the selective incorporation of positive information. These findings offer novel insights into self-concept dynamics, with implications for the understanding of psychopathological conditions."

Despite ideas about the equivalence between MI and execution, the relationship between visual-motor experiences and MI ability is unclear. Here we evaluated how distinct experiences (i.e., no-vision physical and observational practice) impact visual and kinesthetic MI ability. Participants (N = 66) were randomized into three groups; no-vision physical practice, observational practice and no-practice control. Participants practiced and then visually and kinesthetically imagined two hand gesture sequences. Mental chronometry, a movement time (MT) congruency measure, and MI quality ratings were used to assess MI. As predicted, physical practice produced higher ratings for kinesthetic MI and observational practice elicited higher ratings for visual MI. However, physical practice did not result in greater temporal congruency between imagined/executed MTs in comparison to other groups. We conclude that MI is only partially tied to the motor representation as physical practice was not essential for enhancing MI quality. The motor representation developed with no-vision practice improved perceptions of kinesthetic MI, but without the expected congruence in timing, questioning the equivalence between execution and MI."

Peelle, Todd Braver","Decision-making regarding cognitive effort engagement is a common feature of everyday experience, with important consequences for academic, career, and health outcomes. Yet, despite its hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost-benefit decision-making. To examine this question, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when it was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two cognitive domains, and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role for the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost- benefit decision-making."

The current study approached this question by examining the role of domain-specific KAS for the development of professional knowledge (PK) in vocational education and training (VET). Our analyses recurred on (1) school achievement tests that assess domain-specific KAS in chemistry, physics, and math, (2) occupation-specific achievement tests in the same domains to assess PK (and its development) in VET, and (3) comparisons between different VET programs to isolate the effects of learning opportunities on PK acquisition over time and their interaction with KAS. Data stemmed from a sample of N = 2,775 trainees from three VET groups (chemical laboratory assistants, technicians, and industrial clerks) that are characterized by a focus on different knowledge domains. Our findings suggest that VET does not affect the knowledge assessed with school achievement tests. Instead, VET programs provide learning opportunities that facilitate the acquisition of domain-specific PK. In addition, KAS matters for subsequent learning in VET because it (1) determines the level of PK with which trainees enter VET and (2) enables trainees to make better use of the learning opportunities to develop their professional knowledge."

Yet previous studies often assume identical payoffs between observer and demonstrator, overlooking the diversity of real-world interactions. We address this gap by introducing a socially correlated bandit task that accommodates payoff differences among participants, allowing for the study of social learning under more realistic conditions. Our novel Social Generalization (SG) model, tested through evolutionary simulations and two online experiments, outperforms existing models by incorporating social information into the generalization process, but treated as noisier than individual observations. Our findings suggest that human social learning is more flexible than previously believed, with the SG model indicating a potential resource-rational trade-off where social learning partially replaces individual exploration. This research highlights the flexibility of humans social learning, allowing us to integrate social information from others with different preferences, skills, or goals."

I also attempt to further clarify the concept of conspiracy mentality. Building on Imhoff and Bruder’s (2014) conceptualisation of conspiracy mentality as a generalised political attitude, I propose to adopt the working assumption that conspiracy mentality consists in a worldview, that is, a set of descriptive beliefs and assumptions about how the world functions. Adopting this assumption clarifies the questions of the constituents (descriptive beliefs – whose content remains to be investigated) and associates (e.g., prescriptive beliefs, behaviours) of conspiracy mentality. It also clarifies the causal mechanisms through which conspiracy mentality may foster the endorsement of specific conspiracy beliefs (e.g., through motivated reasoning), and vice versa (e.g., through inductive reasoning). I propose five basic working assumptions to facilitate research on this topic."

Much of this work is based on cross-sectional data, assuming that the words typically known to children at n months predict the words typically known to children at n+x months. Given acknowledged variability in the number of words known to individual children at different ages, a more conclusive analysis of this issue requires examination of individual differences in the words learned by individual children across development, i.e., using longitudinal data. In the current study, using longitudinal vocabulary data from children learning Norwegian, we ask whether the phonological connectivity of a word to words that the child already knows or words in the child’s environment predicts the likelihood of the child learning that word across development. We compare three different measures of phonological connectivity that have been used in the literature to-date. The results suggest that the early vocabulary grows predominantly in a rich-get-richer manner, where word learning is predicted by the connectivity of a word to already known words. However, word learning is, to a lesser extent, also influenced by the connectivity of a word to words in the child’s linguistic environment. Our results highlight the promise of using longitudinal data to better understand the factors that influence vocabulary development and the insights to be gained from analyzing different measures of the same construct."

Examining associations of job and leisure satisfaction with life satisfaction up to retirement,To be fetched,"A satisfying job is important for workers across their work lifespan. However, before workers retire, it is often assumed that they start to become less attached to their workplace and focus on other life areas instead. This supposed disengagement process, however, is not well understood. To date, few studies have examined whether the importance that an individual attaches to their job changes as they approach retirement. Likewise, it is not known which life areas become more important in anticipation of retirement. In the present study, we used longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 2,866) to investigate if the within-person associations between job and life satisfaction and between leisure and life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. We found that in this sample, job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time, but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. We discuss these findings in the context of work disengagement and self-regulation theories and highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment."

Electrophysiological responses of 58 participants were recorded during semantic, affective, and grammatical decision tasks on words parametrically varied in concreteness. Our findings uncovered a fine-grained concreteness effect within four distinct spatiotemporal windows when a coding of semantic information is required.

We also identified a concreteness effect characterised by greater negativity in the N400 component. In the affective task, we observed a more pronounced parietal P600-like component for more abstract concepts. Interestingly, we found that the neural representational similarity (starting from 450 ms with a widespread scalp distribution) conformed to the concreteness similarity among concepts (regardless of the task), implying that their semantic representations may be characterised along the concreteness dimension in the brain.

In the current study, using longitudinal vocabulary data from children learning Norwegian, we ask whether the phonological connectivity of a word to words that the child already knows or words in the child’s environment predicts the likelihood of the child learning that word across development. We compare three different measures of phonological connectivity that have been used in the literature to-date. The results suggest that the early vocabulary grows predominantly in a rich-get-richer manner, where word learning is predicted by the connectivity of a word to already known words. However, word learning is, to a lesser extent, also influenced by the connectivity of a word to words in the child’s linguistic environment. Our results highlight the promise of using longitudinal data to better understand the factors that influence vocabulary development and the insights to be gained from analyzing different measures of the same construct."

Examining associations of job and leisure satisfaction with life satisfaction up to retirement,"Georg Henning, Graciela Muniz-Terrera, Andreas Stenling, Sophie Potter, Martin Hyde","A satisfying job is important for workers across their work lifespan. However, before workers retire, it is often assumed that they start to become less attached to their workplace and focus on other life areas instead. This supposed disengagement process, however, is not well understood. To date, few studies have examined whether the importance that an individual attaches to their job changes as they approach retirement. Likewise, it is not known which life areas become more important in anticipation of retirement. In the present study, we used longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 2,866) to investigate if the within-person associations between job and life satisfaction and between leisure and life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. We found that in this sample, job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time, but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. We discuss these findings in the context of work disengagement and self-regulation theories and highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment."

I also attempt to further clarify the concept of conspiracy mentality. Building on Imhoff and Bruder’s (2014) conceptualisation of conspiracy mentality as a generalised political attitude, I propose to adopt the working assumption that conspiracy mentality consists in a worldview, that is, a set of descriptive beliefs and assumptions about how the world functions. Adopting this assumption clarifies the questions of the constituents (descriptive beliefs – whose content remains to be investigated) and associates (e.g., prescriptive beliefs, behaviours) of conspiracy mentality. It also clarifies the causal mechanisms through which conspiracy mentality may foster the endorsement of specific conspiracy beliefs (e.g., through motivated reasoning), and vice versa (e.g., through inductive reasoning). I propose five basic working assumptions to facilitate research on this topic."

Wu","There has been much progress in understanding human social learning, including recent studies integrating social information into the reinforcement learning framework. Yet previous studies often assume identical payoffs between observer and demonstrator, overlooking the diversity of real-world interactions. We address this gap by introducing a socially correlated bandit task that accommodates payoff differences among participants, allowing for the study of social learning under more realistic conditions. Our novel Social Generalization (SG) model, tested through evolutionary simulations and two online experiments, outperforms existing models by incorporating social information into the generalization process, but treated as noisier than individual observations. Our findings suggest that human social learning is more flexible than previously believed, with the SG model indicating a potential resource-rational trade-off where social learning partially replaces individual exploration. This research highlights the flexibility of humans social learning, allowing us to integrate social information from others with different preferences, skills, or goals."

Etzel, Aiso Heinze, Knut Neumann, Sascha Bernholt, Jan Retelsdorf, Olaf Köller, Gabriel Nagy","A commonly held belief is that knowledge acquired in school (KAS) matters for later stages of education because it enables individuals to make better use of new learning opportunities. The current study approached this question by examining the role of domain-specific KAS for the development of professional knowledge (PK) in vocational education and training (VET). Our analyses recurred on (1) school achievement tests that assess domain-specific KAS in chemistry, physics, and math, (2) occupation-specific achievement tests in the same domains to assess PK (and its development) in VET, and (3) comparisons between different VET programs to isolate the effects of learning opportunities on PK acquisition over time and their interaction with KAS. Data stemmed from a sample of N = 2,775 trainees from three VET groups (chemical laboratory assistants, technicians, and industrial clerks) that are characterized by a focus on different knowledge domains. Our findings suggest that VET does not affect the knowledge assessed with school achievement tests. Instead, VET programs provide learning opportunities that facilitate the acquisition of domain-specific PK. In addition, KAS matters for subsequent learning in VET because it (1) determines the level of PK with which trainees enter VET and (2) enables trainees to make better use of the learning opportunities to develop their professional knowledge."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/q27e3,2024-02-23,Phenotyping in clinical laterality research: a comparison of commonly used methods to determine mixed-handedness and ambidexterity,To be fetched,"An increased prevalence of mixed-handedness has been reported in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, there is high between-study variability in the definition of mixed-handedness, leading to a major methodological problem in clinical laterality research and endangering replicability and comparability of research findings. Adding to this challenge is the fact that sometimes researchers use the concepts of mixed-handedness and ambidexterity interchangeably. Therefore, having a consensus on how to determine mixed-handedness and how to distinguish it from ambidexterity is crucial for clinical laterality research. To this end, hand preference and hand performance data from more than 600 participants from the Dortmund Vital Study (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05155397), a population-based study in Germany, was analyzed to ascertain an optimal classification to determine mixed-handedness and ambidexterity. Using a combination of latent class analyses, effect size determination, and comparisons with the existing literature, we establish that an LQ cut-off criterion of +/-60 for mixed-handedness is optimal for future clinical laterality studies. Moreover, we show that mixed-handedness and ambidexterity are not identical and that the terms should not be used interchangeably. We further highlight the need for a consensus on how to mathematically determine ambidexterity as results of existing categorization schemes largely differ."

However, current training methods often lack sufficient opportunities for realistic practice. This study details a three-phase development and evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) application for disability support staff to safely build de-escalation skills through simulated interactions. The first phase involved creating VR prototype scenarios depicting escalations with teen clients. Next, content validation by 12 disability-support experts refined the scenarios to confirm appropriateness and realism. Finally, a pilot study tested the tool’s usability and examined initial construct validity in 20 participants. The prototype achieved high usability ratings (average 81.0 (SD 10.7) on the System Usability Scale), and a positive correlation between VR performance and empathy levels were found (Pearson’s r = 0.487, p = 0.035). The promising results highlight the VR application’s potential as a transformative training tool. Future research should expand scenario diversity and compare VR with traditional methods to establish its efficacy in diverse settings and offer a path to enhance staff capabilities in challenging environments."

Here, we examined the joint role of maths anxiety (MA) and maths motivation (MM; self-efficacy and interest in maths) on STEM career choice in emerging adulthood using self-reported data from 7,908 Twins Early Development Study participants collected at ages ~16 (MM), ~18 (MA) and ~21 (STEM career choice). We found that MA and MM were associated with STEM career choice (r=-0.23 and r=0.28, respectively). However, MM was a stronger independent predictor for STEM career choice (OR=2.11) than MA (OR=0.79), which did not predict STEM career choice after adjusting for maths achievement. Notably, MM was predictive of STEM career choices in both male (OR=1.95) and female (OR=2.72) cohorts, while MA showed a predictive relationship only in the male cohort (OR=0.63). These results highlight the importance of nurturing maths motivation in interventions designed to bridge the STEM skills gap for all genders. Future research should consider the co-development of maths anxiety and maths motivation across development to better understand their influence on STEM career paths."

Limb immobilisation has been associated with decrease in corticomotor efficiency and atypical multi-sensory integration. The present study explored the role of predisposition to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation-like experiences in maintaining corticomotor efficiency by rTMS stimulation. Twelve healthy participants were recruited to participate in a limb immobilisation within-subject paradigm. All participants completed two trait-based measures (relating to aberrant experiences and depersonalisation experiences and a state-based measure (where skin conductance responses were measured to a fake blood-giving procedure) indexing interoceptive vulnerability. Cortical excitability was measured by motor evoked potential (MEP) responses to single-pulse TMS in a stepwise procedure for each day of immobilisation. Participants were then randomised into a treatment group (n = 6) who received six 1.5 seconds 50 Hz repetitive inter-pulse trains at 60s intervals and a sham group (n = 6) per day of immobilisation. The results indicated that although the stimulation paradigm was successful in increasing cortical excitability initially, these effects were not maintained throughout the immobilisation period and MEPs evidenced a continual decrease in amplitude over time. Stratification of the participants based on trait-based and state-based measures did not produce any reliable findings. Taken together, this indicated that the stimulation paradigm in isolation was insufficient in maintaining cortical excitability and that baseline brain states are an important consideration for future alternative therapeutic paradigms. Theoretical and methodological improvements are discussed."

Stimuli were either passively observed or evoked by voluntary button-presses with the dominant or non-dominant hand, in a manner that was either congruent or incongruent with stimulus laterality and hemifield. Early occipital responses (C1 and P1 components) revealed modulations consistent with sensory attenuation (SA) for self-evoked stimuli. Our findings suggest that sensory attenuation during the initial stages of visual processing (C1 component) is a general phenomenon across all degrees of handedness and stimulus/movement combinations. However, the degree of C1 suppression was modulated by handedness and movement-stimulus congruency, reflecting stronger SA in right-handed participants for stimuli depicting the right hand, when elicited by actions of the corresponding hand. P1 modulation suggested concurrent but opposing influences of attention and sensory prediction, with more pronounced suppression following button-presses over the hemisphere contralateral to movement, especially in left-handed individuals. We suggest that effects of motor dominance on the degree of SA may stem from functional/anatomical asymmetries in the processing of body parts (C1) and attention networks (P1). Overall, our results demonstrate the modulating effect of hand dominance and movement-outcome congruency on SA, underscoring the need for deeper exploration of their interplay. Additional empirical evidence in this direction could substantiate a premotor account for action-associated modulation of early sensory processing in the visual domain."

Participants were then randomised into a treatment group (n = 6) who received six 1.5 seconds 50 Hz repetitive inter-pulse trains at 60s intervals and a sham group (n = 6) per day of immobilisation. The results indicated that although the stimulation paradigm was successful in increasing cortical excitability initially, these effects were not maintained throughout the immobilisation period and MEPs evidenced a continual decrease in amplitude over time. Stratification of the participants based on trait-based and state-based measures did not produce any reliable findings. Taken together, this indicated that the stimulation paradigm in isolation was insufficient in maintaining cortical excitability and that baseline brain states are an important consideration for future alternative therapeutic paradigms. Theoretical and methodological improvements are discussed."

Here, we examined the joint role of maths anxiety (MA) and maths motivation (MM; self-efficacy and interest in maths) on STEM career choice in emerging adulthood using self-reported data from 7,908 Twins Early Development Study participants collected at ages ~16 (MM), ~18 (MA) and ~21 (STEM career choice). We found that MA and MM were associated with STEM career choice (r=-0.23 and r=0.28, respectively). However, MM was a stronger independent predictor for STEM career choice (OR=2.11) than MA (OR=0.79), which did not predict STEM career choice after adjusting for maths achievement. Notably, MM was predictive of STEM career choices in both male (OR=1.95) and female (OR=2.72) cohorts, while MA showed a predictive relationship only in the male cohort (OR=0.63). These results highlight the importance of nurturing maths motivation in interventions designed to bridge the STEM skills gap for all genders. Future research should consider the co-development of maths anxiety and maths motivation across development to better understand their influence on STEM career paths."

Gajewski, Mauro Larra, Edmund Wascher, Erhan Genç, Sebastian Ocklenburg","An increased prevalence of mixed-handedness has been reported in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, there is high between-study variability in the definition of mixed-handedness, leading to a major methodological problem in clinical laterality research and endangering replicability and comparability of research findings. Adding to this challenge is the fact that sometimes researchers use the concepts of mixed-handedness and ambidexterity interchangeably. Therefore, having a consensus on how to determine mixed-handedness and how to distinguish it from ambidexterity is crucial for clinical laterality research. To this end, hand preference and hand performance data from more than 600 participants from the Dortmund Vital Study (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05155397), a population-based study in Germany, was analyzed to ascertain an optimal classification to determine mixed-handedness and ambidexterity. Using a combination of latent class analyses, effect size determination, and comparisons with the existing literature, we establish that an LQ cut-off criterion of +/-60 for mixed-handedness is optimal for future clinical laterality studies. Moreover, we show that mixed-handedness and ambidexterity are not identical and that the terms should not be used interchangeably. We further highlight the need for a consensus on how to mathematically determine ambidexterity as results of existing categorization schemes largely differ."

However, current training methods often lack sufficient opportunities for realistic practice. This study details a three-phase development and evaluation of a virtual reality (VR) application for disability support staff to safely build de-escalation skills through simulated interactions. The first phase involved creating VR prototype scenarios depicting escalations with teen clients. Next, content validation by 12 disability-support experts refined the scenarios to confirm appropriateness and realism. Finally, a pilot study tested the tool’s usability and examined initial construct validity in 20 participants. The prototype achieved high usability ratings (average 81.0 (SD 10.7) on the System Usability Scale), and a positive correlation between VR performance and empathy levels were found (Pearson’s r = 0.487, p = 0.035). The promising results highlight the VR application’s potential as a transformative training tool. Future research should expand scenario diversity and compare VR with traditional methods to establish its efficacy in diverse settings and offer a path to enhance staff capabilities in challenging environments."

Currently, the chronic mTBI literature conveys conflicting findings, likely in large part due to the use of measures that lack sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive changes and failures to consider individual differences in cognitive outcomes post mTBI. In addition, while it is well documented that a significant number of injuries go unreported, studies investigating individuals with a history of mTBI that capture these unreported injuries are lacking in comparison to those using hospital-based samples. In this preregistered study, we used a range of complex behavioural tasks to investigate cognitive performance in a large sample of individuals with self-reported history of mTBI (n=82) and a control group (n=88). We also explored whether individual differences in injury-related factors predict cognitive performance in the mTBI group. The findings revealed poorer verbal working memory performance in mTBI participants compared to controls. No group differences were observed on tasks assessing visual working memory, multitasking ability, cognitive flexibility, attentional control, visuospatial ability, or information processing speed. Furthermore, the individual differences analyses suggest that age at injury may be an important predictor of working memory performance in both verbal and visual domains following mTBI. Together, these findings indicate that mTBI may have lasting impacts on verbal working memory capacity and that injury-related factors, such as age when the injury occurred, may be crucial to consider when assessing cognitive outcome in individuals with a history of mTBI."

In a recently discovered visual illusion (the “Frame Effect”), it has been shown that flashing a stimulus inside of a moving frame produces a large misperception of that stimulus’s position. Across two experiments, we investigated a novel illusion (the “Split Stimulus Effect”) where the symmetrical motion of two overlaid frames produces two simultaneous positional misperceptions of a single stimulus. That is, one stimulus is presented but two are perceived. In both experiments, a single red dot was flashed when the moving frames reversed direction, and participants were asked to report how many dots they saw. Naïve participants sometimes reported seeing two dots when only one was presented indicating spontaneous perception of the illusion. A Bayesian analysis of the population prevalence of this effect was conducted. The dependence of this effect on the frames’ speed, the dot’s opacity, selective attention, as the presence/absence of pre-flash motion (‘postdiction’) was also investigated, and the features of this illusion were compared to similar motion position illusions within a predictive processing framework. In demonstrating this illusory “splitting” effect, this study is the first to show that it’s possible to be simultaneously aware of two opposing perceptual predictions about a single object, and provides evidence of the hyperpriors that limit and inform the structure of visual experience."

Three preregistered studies revealed that White men from the U.S. who scored higher on precarious manhood beliefs were less motivated to confront racism (Studies 1 &amp; 3; Ns=398 &amp; 447), reported they would view themselves negatively if they confronted racism (Studies 1-3), and reported more negative attitudes toward Black people in general (Study 3). Exploratory free-response data from Study 2 (N=366) showed that the more strongly White men endorsed precarious manhood, the less likely they were to report they would feel proud of themselves for confronting racism. Together, these findings suggest that White men’s precarious manhood beliefs may represent a hindrance to confronting racism."

Across both experiments, we successfully replicated temporal binding effects in Temporal Estimation, Temporal Reproduction, and the Libet Clock, but not in Stimulus Anticipation.

Fortunately, analysis techniques enable matching biased samples to known population characteristics, e.g., age, gender, and employment status. This study’s aim is twofold. First, we validate the Danish version of the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI-da), a self-report inventory assessing various aspects of musical sophistication on continuous scales in the general population. Then, we demonstrate the use of stratification techniques and quantify the influence of sample composition by comparing results from analyses performed on our biased sample to similar analyses performed using stratified subsampling and poststratification weights to increase representativeness. The bifactor structure of the Gold-MSI-da was consistently replicated showing similar subscale percentiles in three sample variants. Psychometric benchmarks of internal consistency aligned with benchmarks from other language versions, and although model fits were weaker in the most representative sample, they were still acceptable. Interestingly, the sizes of the effect of self-reported musical training and expertise on musical listening abilities diminished with increasing sample representativeness, indicating potential overestimation when relying on non-representative samples. We conclude that the Gold-MSI-da is a valid tool for assessing musical sophistication in the Danish general population."

To obtain these data, many social scientists recruit study participants from online panels that provide access to large numbers of people willing to do tasks for modest compensation. In a large study (total N=13,053), we explore nine non-probability samples of American respondents drawn from panels used in social science research, comparing them on three dimensions: data quality (attention, effort, lying, speeding, and attrition), representativeness (demographics, attitude typicality, and responding to experimental treatments), and professionalism (number of studies taken, frequency of taking studies, and modality of device the study is taken on). We document substantial variation across these samples on each dimension. Most notably, there is a clear tradeoff between the representativeness and data quality of samples, such that samples with higher data quality tend to be less representative, and vice versa. Prolific, a Mechanical Turk panel maintained by a research group at Stanford, Cloud Research’s Connect panel, and Cloud Research’s Mechanical Turk panel were highest on data quality, but the least representative. Cloud Research’s Connect panel with demographic quotas and Prolific’s “Nationally representative” quota option maintained the same level of data quality and were somewhat more representative. Bovitz-Forthright and Lucid were the most representative samples but had lower data quality (with data quality on Lucid being particularly low). Interestingly, this tension between data quality and representativeness can be somewhat mitigated by using the most representative samples and screening for attentiveness: filters can allow Bovitz-Forthright and (via much heavier filtering) Lucid to achieve data quality parity comparable with the higher scoring samples, with doing so preserving representativeness on Bovitz-Forthright (but reducing representativeness on Lucid). Finally, recruiting participants directly from Mechanical Turk was the worst sample on all measured dimensions. Our findings provide a guide to help researchers decide which sample is optimal given one’s research question and constraints."

Results: Statistically significant increases in self-compassion scores were observed both immediately after the program (8.31%) and at follow-up (21.73%) compared to baseline. Additionally, the program led to improvements in self-kindness, over-identification, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, and mindfulness, with some effects emerging later at follow-up. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the Inner Garden program is a promising intervention for enhancing self-compassion and promoting well-being among youth workers, with positive effects persisting even two months after program completion. Further research with larger samples and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these initial findings and explore potential mechanisms of change."

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program, which responds to maternal mental health and parenting needs while building social connection between participants.   Design: A two-arm, phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the BEAM intervention compared to unrestricted services-as-usual (US). Participants completed self-report measures at eligibility screening (baseline assessment, T0), prior to randomization (pre-intervention, T1) and immediately following the intervention (post-intervention, T2).   Setting: Individuals were recruited and completed surveys online.   Participants: A final sample of 119 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who self-reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.  Intervention: Individuals randomized to treatment participated in the 10-week BEAM program. It was hypothesized that the treatment group would report decreases in mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, anger, alcohol use, sleep problems) and harsh parenting (overreactive parenting, conflictual parent-child interactions) compared to the US group.     Results: BEAM out-performed the US condition in reducing anxiety symptoms. Participants in both groups experienced significant decreases in depression. Participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms at screening, experienced significant decreases in mental health symptoms and harsh parenting composite scores, if they received the BEAM program, compared to US. This included specific declines in anxiety, anger, and dysfunctional parenting interactions. There were no significant effects for sleep problems, alcohol misuse, or overactive discipline.    Conclusion and Relevance: BEAM is a highly scalable intervention that has the potential to rapidly reach underserved groups in need of mental health and parenting support. Next steps include improving the user interface and exploring engagement and implementation of the program within existing health and social service systems for long-term improvements in family health and well-being."

Berinsky, Antonio Alonso Arechar, Robb Willer, David Rand","Social scientists rely heavily on data collected from human participants via surveys or experiments. To obtain these data, many social scientists recruit study participants from online panels that provide access to large numbers of people willing to do tasks for modest compensation. In a large study (total N=13,053), we explore nine non-probability samples of American respondents drawn from panels used in social science research, comparing them on three dimensions: data quality (attention, effort, lying, speeding, and attrition), representativeness (demographics, attitude typicality, and responding to experimental treatments), and professionalism (number of studies taken, frequency of taking studies, and modality of device the study is taken on). We document substantial variation across these samples on each dimension. Most notably, there is a clear tradeoff between the representativeness and data quality of samples, such that samples with higher data quality tend to be less representative, and vice versa. Prolific, a Mechanical Turk panel maintained by a research group at Stanford, Cloud Research’s Connect panel, and Cloud Research’s Mechanical Turk panel were highest on data quality, but the least representative. Cloud Research’s Connect panel with demographic quotas and Prolific’s “Nationally representative” quota option maintained the same level of data quality and were somewhat more representative. Bovitz-Forthright and Lucid were the most representative samples but had lower data quality (with data quality on Lucid being particularly low). Interestingly, this tension between data quality and representativeness can be somewhat mitigated by using the most representative samples and screening for attentiveness: filters can allow Bovitz-Forthright and (via much heavier filtering) Lucid to achieve data quality parity comparable with the higher scoring samples, with doing so preserving representativeness on Bovitz-Forthright (but reducing representativeness on Lucid). Finally, recruiting participants directly from Mechanical Turk was the worst sample on all measured dimensions. Our findings provide a guide to help researchers decide which sample is optimal given one’s research question and constraints."

While institutions and social structures play an important role in resolving conflicts, societies which emphasize egalitarianism often prioritize individual autonomy and lack strong socio-political institutions. Existing scholarship highlights the critical role of leaders in facilitating conflict resolution, particularly in the maintenance of group cohesion under egalitarianism. Here we investigate the association of peer-rated conflict resolution skills with 11 peer-rated psycho-social traits linked to leadership in a sample of 60 individuals from a Chabu community, a relatively egalitarian population of forest-dwelling Ethiopian forager-horticulturalists. We employ network-based methods and Bayesian multi-level modeling to identify trait clustering, trait-based linkages, and the key predictors of conflict resolution skills. We found that conflict resolution skills cluster with decision-making abilities, intelligence, social alliances, and expertise, while attributes such as being respected and liked constitute another distinct cluster. Conversely, traits like aggressiveness, being feared, and farming productivity align within a third separate cluster. After accounting for inter-rater variation, sound decision-making and intelligence (i.e., neural capital) as well as social alliances were positive predictors of conflict resolution skills, while aggressiveness was a negative predictor. Our results also reveal an overlap in similarity networks between women and men. These findings suggest that, when it comes to effective conflict resolution, it is neither better to be feared nor loved. Instead, in this egalitarian social context, well-connected individuals equipped with high levels of neural capital emerge as the most effective conflict mediators. Our results shed light on leadership phenotypes associated with conflict resolution under egalitarianism. Additionally, they carry implications for the evolution of group living among humans by highlighting the pivotal role of neural capital in promoting effective conflict mediation in more close-knit social contexts."

However, such treatment approaches are not widely accessible due to legal, medical, and financial limitations. In this study, we explore the potential of circular breathwork to serve as a non-pharmacological and hence more easily accessible alternative to engage similar therapeutic processes. Scientific studies investigating the effects of breathwork on mental health are only just emerging and the underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to address these questions by for the first time tracking physiological and experiential dynamics throughout the time course of a breathwork session, comparing two popular forms of breathwork: Holotropic Breathwork® and Consciously-Connected breathwork. We show that a reduction in end-tidal CO2 pressure due to deliberate hyperventilation is instrumental in catalyzing ASCs during breathwork. The ASCs evoked by breathwork were comparable to those produced by psychedelics, and their depth predicted psychological and physiological follow-on effects, including improved well-being and a reduction of depressive symptoms. Further analysis showed that different breathwork traditions impacted physiological markers as well as experiential and psychological outcomes in a similar way. Our findings identify physiological boundary conditions in which ASCs can arise in a non-pharmacological context, offering insights into the functional mechanisms of breathwork as well as its potential as a psychotherapeutic tool."

The newborns had reliable ERPs to native vowels from conception age 36 weeks and 1 day (36+1). The ERPs reflected spectral distinctions between vowel onsets from conception age 36+6 and durational distinctions at vowel offsets from conception age 37+6. Starting at age 40+1, there was evidence of neural discrimination of native vowel length contrast, indexed by a reliably negative MMR response. The present findings extend our understanding of the earliest stages of speech perception development in that they pinpoint the ages at which the cortex reliably responds to the phonetic characteristics of individual speech sounds and discriminates a native phoneme contrast. Curiously, the age at which the brain reliably differentiates vowel onsets coincides with what is considered term age in many countries (37+0 GA). Future studies should investigate to what extent the perinatal maturation of the cortical responses to speech sounds is modulated by the ambient language."

Linguistic research has demonstrated that sign languages and spoken languages both exhibit hierarchical constituent structure which determines how individual elements in a sentence relate to each other. Here, we report the first adaptation of the psycholinguistic “click” paradigm, which aims to demonstrate the relevance of hierarchical constituent structure during auditory language processing, to the visuo-spatial modality of sign languages. We performed two independent online experiments: The main experiment with a group of 53 deaf signers using German Sign Language (DGS) as their primary means of communication and a control experiment with a group of 53 hearing non-signers. Both groups were shown videos of syntactically complex sentences in DGS. A white flash (mimicking the “click” in the auditory domain) to which participants had to respond could occur as an overlay to the video at different levels in the constituent structure. Our pre- registered inferential analyses yielded no effect for our syntactic manipulations, neither in the group of signers nor in the group of non-signers. Additional exploratory analyses suggest general effects of attention during the processing of communicative signals, as even the group of non-signers’ behaviour was influenced by non-manual cues despite their lack of knowledge of DGS. We conclude that the simultaneous and time-shifted presence of different syntax-relevant cues (i.e., hands, mouthings, and non-manuals) makes the sign stream robust against disruption by extraneous visual signals and argue that non-signers attend to some non-manual cues due to their resemblance of communicative gestures."

The results showed a significant spatialization effect for all sequence lengths except for sequences of 5 items. In Experiment 2, 96 participants performed the same spatialization task for sequences of three, four, and five items but using a within-subject design.

However, in the scientific literature, taboo language is poorly characterized, and how it is realized in different languages and populations remains largely unexplored. Here we provide a database of taboo words, collected from different linguistic communities (Study 1, N = 1,046), along with their speaker-centered semantic characterization (Study 2, N = 455 for each of six rating dimensions), covering 13 languages and 17 countries from all five permanently inhabited continents. Our results show that, in all languages, taboo words are mainly characterized by extremely low valence and high arousal, and very low written frequency. However, a significant amount of cross-country variability in words’ tabooness and offensiveness proves the importance of community-specific sociocultural knowledge in the study of taboo language."

The results showed a significant spatialization effect for all sequence lengths except for sequences of 5 items. In Experiment 2, 96 participants performed the same spatialization task for sequences of three, four, and five items but using a within-subject design. The results confirmed the absence of a SPoARC effect for sequences of five items, and showed a greater effect for sequences of four items.

The present experiment assessed the neural event-related potentials (ERP) and mismatch responses (MMR) to native vowels in 99 neonates born between 32 and 42 weeks of gestation age (GA). The newborns had reliable ERPs to native vowels from conception age 36 weeks and 1 day (36+1). The ERPs reflected spectral distinctions between vowel onsets from conception age 36+6 and durational distinctions at vowel offsets from conception age 37+6. Starting at age 40+1, there was evidence of neural discrimination of native vowel length contrast, indexed by a reliably negative MMR response. The present findings extend our understanding of the earliest stages of speech perception development in that they pinpoint the ages at which the cortex reliably responds to the phonetic characteristics of individual speech sounds and discriminates a native phoneme contrast. Curiously, the age at which the brain reliably differentiates vowel onsets coincides with what is considered term age in many countries (37+0 GA). Future studies should investigate to what extent the perinatal maturation of the cortical responses to speech sounds is modulated by the ambient language."

In three lab experiments (N=424), we explored two explanations of this phenomenon: reduced anticipation of regret, or increased accessibility of risk-increasing thoughts. Participants in native and foreign language considered two prenatal tests: a less sensitive but safe, and a more sensitive one – their task was to specify the level of risk of miscarriage of the more sensitive test while still choosing it. Three studies demonstrated greater willingness to take risks in a foreign language but this effect was not mediated by changes in the accessibility of thoughts or anticipated regret."

Trettenbrein, Matteo Maran, Jan Pohl, Thomas A. Finkbeiner, Emiliano Zaccarella, Angela D. Friederici, Markus Steinbach, Nina-Kristin Meister","Sentences are not just mere strings of words or signs but manifest a complex internal structure. Linguistic research has demonstrated that sign languages and spoken languages both exhibit hierarchical constituent structure which determines how individual elements in a sentence relate to each other. Here, we report the first adaptation of the psycholinguistic “click” paradigm, which aims to demonstrate the relevance of hierarchical constituent structure during auditory language processing, to the visuo-spatial modality of sign languages. We performed two independent online experiments: The main experiment with a group of 53 deaf signers using German Sign Language (DGS) as their primary means of communication and a control experiment with a group of 53 hearing non-signers. Both groups were shown videos of syntactically complex sentences in DGS. A white flash (mimicking the “click” in the auditory domain) to which participants had to respond could occur as an overlay to the video at different levels in the constituent structure. Our pre- registered inferential analyses yielded no effect for our syntactic manipulations, neither in the group of signers nor in the group of non-signers. Additional exploratory analyses suggest general effects of attention during the processing of communicative signals, as even the group of non-signers’ behaviour was influenced by non-manual cues despite their lack of knowledge of DGS. We conclude that the simultaneous and time-shifted presence of different syntax-relevant cues (i.e., hands, mouthings, and non-manuals) makes the sign stream robust against disruption by extraneous visual signals and argue that non-signers attend to some non-manual cues due to their resemblance of communicative gestures."

In contrast, perceptual imagination is commonly taken to be non-assertoric: Imagining winning a piano contest does not incline the imaginer to believe they actually won. However, abundant evidence from clinical and experimental psychology shows that imagination influences attitudes and behavior in ways similar to perceptual experiences. To account for these phenomena, I propose that perceptual imaginings have implicit assertoric force and put forth a theory—the Prima Facie View—as a unified explanation for the empirical findings reviewed. According to this view, mental images are treated as percepts in operations involving associative memory. Finally, I address alternative explanations that could account for the reviewed empirical evidence—such as a Spinozian model of belief formation or Gendler’s notion of alief—as well as potential objections to the Prima Facie View."

However, such treatment approaches are not widely accessible due to legal, medical, and financial limitations. In this study, we explore the potential of circular breathwork to serve as a non-pharmacological and hence more easily accessible alternative to engage similar therapeutic processes. Scientific studies investigating the effects of breathwork on mental health are only just emerging and the underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to address these questions by for the first time tracking physiological and experiential dynamics throughout the time course of a breathwork session, comparing two popular forms of breathwork: Holotropic Breathwork® and Consciously-Connected breathwork. We show that a reduction in end-tidal CO2 pressure due to deliberate hyperventilation is instrumental in catalyzing ASCs during breathwork. The ASCs evoked by breathwork were comparable to those produced by psychedelics, and their depth predicted psychological and physiological follow-on effects, including improved well-being and a reduction of depressive symptoms. Further analysis showed that different breathwork traditions impacted physiological markers as well as experiential and psychological outcomes in a similar way. Our findings identify physiological boundary conditions in which ASCs can arise in a non-pharmacological context, offering insights into the functional mechanisms of breathwork as well as its potential as a psychotherapeutic tool."

Garfield, Edward Hagen","Group living increases the likelihood of inter-individual conflicts, necessitating effective conflict resolution. While institutions and social structures play an important role in resolving conflicts, societies which emphasize egalitarianism often prioritize individual autonomy and lack strong socio-political institutions. Existing scholarship highlights the critical role of leaders in facilitating conflict resolution, particularly in the maintenance of group cohesion under egalitarianism. Here we investigate the association of peer-rated conflict resolution skills with 11 peer-rated psycho-social traits linked to leadership in a sample of 60 individuals from a Chabu community, a relatively egalitarian population of forest-dwelling Ethiopian forager-horticulturalists. We employ network-based methods and Bayesian multi-level modeling to identify trait clustering, trait-based linkages, and the key predictors of conflict resolution skills. We found that conflict resolution skills cluster with decision-making abilities, intelligence, social alliances, and expertise, while attributes such as being respected and liked constitute another distinct cluster. Conversely, traits like aggressiveness, being feared, and farming productivity align within a third separate cluster. After accounting for inter-rater variation, sound decision-making and intelligence (i.e., neural capital) as well as social alliances were positive predictors of conflict resolution skills, while aggressiveness was a negative predictor. Our results also reveal an overlap in similarity networks between women and men. These findings suggest that, when it comes to effective conflict resolution, it is neither better to be feared nor loved. Instead, in this egalitarian social context, well-connected individuals equipped with high levels of neural capital emerge as the most effective conflict mediators. Our results shed light on leadership phenotypes associated with conflict resolution under egalitarianism. Additionally, they carry implications for the evolution of group living among humans by highlighting the pivotal role of neural capital in promoting effective conflict mediation in more close-knit social contexts."

The aim of this study was to explore children’s and parents’ experiences of the Risky Kids program. We interviewed 18 children aged 6-13 years and held three focus groups with 15 parents and caregivers across three sites (two metropolitan, one regional). Guided by phenomenological design, template analysis was used to generate codes, categories, and themes. We identified four overarching themes: (1) Learning to Navigate Risk; (2) Risky Kids is Different; (3) Coaches Facilitating Growth and Change, and (4) Stronger Minds and Bodies. Findings suggest that a facilitated risky play program can offer a supportive, safe space for children to develop confidence and resilience, and may particularly benefit children who prefer non-competitive group activities that nurture individual strengths and accommodates all abilities. Families reported that the program offered valuable opportunities to enhance children’s mental wellbeing, including social, emotional, and behavioural regulation. Large-scale quantitative evidence is required to examine children’s outcomes, including mechanisms of change."

The extent to which traditional and digital media use is associated with paranoia remains unknown. We aimed to examine associations between media use and paranoia at the within- and between-person levels. Participants were 409 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder. Measures included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, followed by ecological momentary assessments (EMA) collected three times daily over 30 days. EMA evaluated paranoia and five types of media use: TV, social media, music, reading or writing, and other internet or computer use. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine paranoia as a function of each type of media use and vice-versa. Characteristics associated with lower likelihood of media use included minority ethnoracial status, lower educational attainment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder. There were within-person associations between social media use and subsequently reduced paranoia in the schizophrenia group: fold-change=0.900; 95% CI: 0.840, 0.965; and between listening to music and subsequently decreased paranoia in the bipolar disorder group: fold-change=0.949; 95% CI: 0.906, 0.995. Associations of other media with paranoia were not significant. The associations of social media use and listening to music with reductions in paranoia may reflect clinical benefits of social interaction and distraction. However, systemic inequities and individual factors may hamper the accessibility of certain types of media."

When we speak, the sensory consequences of the fundamental frequency (f0) of our own voice, generated by vocal fold vibrations, are suppressed. However, due to bone/air conduction filtering effects, the f0 we self-generate is measurably different from the f0 we subjectively perceive as defining our own voice. Using an auditory change deafness paradigm, we parametrically tested the sensitivity to auditory change in the frequency neighbourhoods of individual objective and subjective voice f0, and found that participants experience change deafness for both to a similar extent, relative to a control pitch condition. We conclude that when we listen attentively, we are likely to filter out voice pitches in the vicinity of our own objective and subjective voice f0, possibly as a long-term consequence of speaking-induced suppression mechanisms integrated with individual, perceptual bodily priors."

Evidence indicates that these behavioral modes entail detection of the relative direction of movement that is used as perceptual information to control and coordinate performance. At higher frequencies, this yields instability of 180° and spontaneous transition to 0°. The ability to perform a 90° coordination can be acquired by learning to detect and use relative position as information. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (2021) found that skilled performance of 90° bimanual coordination exhibits mode switching to 0° or 180° with frequency scaling. Unlike the switching from 180° to 0°, transition from a learned coordination to 0° or 180° entails a change in information. They found that neither this switching nor performance of corrections to resist switching entailed intentional decisions during performance. Relatedly, they found that correction is not intrinsic to skilled performance of 90°. They successfully simulated results of frequency scaling of 90° using an extended Bingham model in which switching and correction were initiated as the information for 90° fell below threshold. We now attempt to replicate these findings testing unimanual 90° coordination with noninterference and correcting instructions. With correcting in the previous study, bimanual 90° coordination remained stable at all frequencies while noninterference instructions yielded mode switching at higher frequencies. Snapp-Childs, Wilson and Bingham (2011) showed that unimanual coordination switches at much lower frequencies than bimanual coordination. It is significantly less stable due to coupling that is unidirectional. The current finding was that unimanual performance of 90° fails to remain stable even with correcting at higher frequencies. Results were simulated using a unimanual version of the extended Bingham model."

They found that performance of 90° coordination remained stable at high frequencies with correcting, but that performance deteriorated as frequency increased without correcting. The participants trained during learning both at performing bimanual and unimanual coordination and in both cases, they trained to the same criterion level of performance. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (submitted) then tested these same participants with frequency scaling of unimanual 90° coordination. They found in this case that the stability of performance was lost in the same way both with and without correcting. The question raised by this difference in results was whether the inability to maintain stable performance of unimanual coordination with correcting was due to the lack of kinesthetic/neural coupling or to the lack of bidirectional coupling present in bimanual coordination. To separate the two differences in coupling, frequency scaling of learned 90° coordination between two people (dyads) was tested in the current study because this was expected to isolate bidirectional coupling without the kinesthetic/neural coupling. Dyadic coordination is strictly visual. However, the results were identical to those found with unimanual coordination. The ability to correct did not yield stable performance at high frequency. An analysis was performed that showed that the coupling in the dyadic coordination was unidirectional contrary to the common expectation. Dyads were not allowed to communicate directly during learning and testing sessions, but they established the role of the coordinator and corrector vs who would just be steady state in organizing the task performance, nevertheless. Some dyads never achieved criterion performance even after over a dozen training sessions. Perchance they failed to achieve the requisite task organization. The results yielded an interesting problem in social psychology."

However, existing approaches are resource intensive, focus more on ‘healthy eating’ and are not necessarily embedded within everyday education. In some cases, parents and educators have received limited training in this area. Therefore, in this qualitative study, parents, teachers, and practitioners (affiliated and non-affiliated with an eating disorder charity, N=16) provided open-ended feedback after engaging with a targeted research informed ED/DE children’s storybook approach. Following reflexive thematic analysis, four global themes were identified: [A] Confidence in approaching the subject and extent of concern, [B] Discussions, training, and empathetic conversations, [C] Social media and social identity, and [D] Application and development. Overall, our findings suggest that ED/DE in children is a concern, and the storybook was viewed as a versatile and valued resource that could support initiating conversation with children, particularly in response to wider societal pressures and factors that can underpin their initial concerns and worries, such as social media. The storybook was also viewed as raising awareness of ED/DE for both parent/practitioner and children, although there is a need for the development of supplementary materials and activities that address other aspects of ED/DE. We discuss these findings in relation to researchers working more closely with external experts to develop credible resources – similar to a storybook approach – to support children and primary care providers in navigating a range of complex topics and issues."

The current research explores the strategies that White people in the Netherlands use to manage their racial-ethnic identity in relation to linking colonialism and current racial inequalities. With this, we examined how White identity strategies were related to ideologies legitimizing racial inequalities. Using mixed-methods consisting of qualitative interviews (N = 24) and quantitative surveys (N = 564), we found that White people exhibited different combinations of prideful (“I am a proud person of our ethnic heritage”), dissociated (“My ethnic group does not have a significant impact on how I see the world”), and power-cognizant (“I am a White person with privileges because of my ethnic group”) identity strategies. Moreover, these White identity strategies were associated with linking colonialism and racial inequalities and, thereby, with ideologies legitimizing them. Specifically, White people holding prideful and dissociated strategies were less likely to link colonialism and racial inequalities than White people who exclusively endorsed power-cognizance. Furthermore, power-cognizant people challenged current-day racial inequalities the most. We conclude by discussing how White European people legitimize or question racial inequalities by managing their Whiteness and the theoretical and practical implications of these findings."

The present research argues that cisheterosexual people in allegedly post-closeted settings deal with inequalities by evading difference based on sexual orientation and gender identity. By emphasizing individuals and their fundamental sameness, cisheterosexual people often evade difference to convey an inclusive standpoint. However, evading difference might also prevent them from pinpointing the very markers of intergroup inequality. Critically, cisheterosexual people might blur their privileged status by evading difference and conflate it with normalcy, and, thereby, further legitimize structural inequalities. Using mixed-methods consisting of interviews (N = 20) and surveys (N = 531), we found that cisheterosexual people in the Netherlands exhibited profile combinations of difference evasion (“People who focus a lot on sexual orientation and gender identity forget that we are all just people”) and inequality evasion (“Compared to cisgender and heterosexual people, LGBTQ people have equal opportunities”). Moreover, these profiles were associated with distinct cisheterosexual identity strategies and, thereby, with ideologies legitimizing inequalities. Specifically, cisheterosexual people evading difference were more likely to also evade inequality than people who acknowledged difference. Moreover, those acknowledging difference were the most prone to pinpoint their privileges as cisheterosexuals. Furthermore, people who acknowledged difference strongly endorsed countering efforts against inequalities and displayed the most system-challenging ideological features. We conclude by discussing how Western European cisheterosexual people perpetuate or counter inequalities by managing difference and the implications of these findings in so-called liberal democracies."

Our results provide a better understanding of the daily short-term dynamics of self-esteem and social interactions in daily life – as they suggest that not only our actual social experiences, but also our anticipation of social interactions matter for daily self-esteem dynamics."

The present research argues that cisheterosexual people in allegedly post-closeted settings deal with inequalities by evading difference based on sexual orientation and gender identity. By emphasizing individuals and their fundamental sameness, cisheterosexual people often evade difference to convey an inclusive standpoint. However, evading difference might also prevent them from pinpointing the very markers of intergroup inequality. Critically, cisheterosexual people might blur their privileged status by evading difference and conflate it with normalcy, and, thereby, further legitimize structural inequalities. Using mixed-methods consisting of interviews (N = 20) and surveys (N = 531), we found that cisheterosexual people in the Netherlands exhibited profile combinations of difference evasion (“People who focus a lot on sexual orientation and gender identity forget that we are all just people”) and inequality evasion (“Compared to cisgender and heterosexual people, LGBTQ people have equal opportunities”). Moreover, these profiles were associated with distinct cisheterosexual identity strategies and, thereby, with ideologies legitimizing inequalities. Specifically, cisheterosexual people evading difference were more likely to also evade inequality than people who acknowledged difference. Moreover, those acknowledging difference were the most prone to pinpoint their privileges as cisheterosexuals. Furthermore, people who acknowledged difference strongly endorsed countering efforts against inequalities and displayed the most system-challenging ideological features. We conclude by discussing how Western European cisheterosexual people perpetuate or counter inequalities by managing difference and the implications of these findings in so-called liberal democracies."

They found that performance of 90° coordination remained stable at high frequencies with correcting, but that performance deteriorated as frequency increased without correcting. The participants trained during learning both at performing bimanual and unimanual coordination and in both cases, they trained to the same criterion level of performance. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (submitted) then tested these same participants with frequency scaling of unimanual 90° coordination. They found in this case that the stability of performance was lost in the same way both with and without correcting. The question raised by this difference in results was whether the inability to maintain stable performance of unimanual coordination with correcting was due to the lack of kinesthetic/neural coupling or to the lack of bidirectional coupling present in bimanual coordination. To separate the two differences in coupling, frequency scaling of learned 90° coordination between two people (dyads) was tested in the current study because this was expected to isolate bidirectional coupling without the kinesthetic/neural coupling. Dyadic coordination is strictly visual. However, the results were identical to those found with unimanual coordination. The ability to correct did not yield stable performance at high frequency. An analysis was performed that showed that the coupling in the dyadic coordination was unidirectional contrary to the common expectation. Dyads were not allowed to communicate directly during learning and testing sessions, but they established the role of the coordinator and corrector vs who would just be steady state in organizing the task performance, nevertheless. Some dyads never achieved criterion performance even after over a dozen training sessions. Perchance they failed to achieve the requisite task organization. The results yielded an interesting problem in social psychology."

Sharpe, Rebecca Petronzi","The issue of eating disorders and disordered eating (ED/DE) is becoming more prevalent in younger children and prevention efforts are required in the formative years. However, existing approaches are resource intensive, focus more on ‘healthy eating’ and are not necessarily embedded within everyday education. In some cases, parents and educators have received limited training in this area. Therefore, in this qualitative study, parents, teachers, and practitioners (affiliated and non-affiliated with an eating disorder charity, N=16) provided open-ended feedback after engaging with a targeted research informed ED/DE children’s storybook approach. Following reflexive thematic analysis, four global themes were identified: [A] Confidence in approaching the subject and extent of concern, [B] Discussions, training, and empathetic conversations, [C] Social media and social identity, and [D] Application and development. Overall, our findings suggest that ED/DE in children is a concern, and the storybook was viewed as a versatile and valued resource that could support initiating conversation with children, particularly in response to wider societal pressures and factors that can underpin their initial concerns and worries, such as social media. The storybook was also viewed as raising awareness of ED/DE for both parent/practitioner and children, although there is a need for the development of supplementary materials and activities that address other aspects of ED/DE. We discuss these findings in relation to researchers working more closely with external experts to develop credible resources – similar to a storybook approach – to support children and primary care providers in navigating a range of complex topics and issues."

The current research explores the strategies that White people in the Netherlands use to manage their racial-ethnic identity in relation to linking colonialism and current racial inequalities. With this, we examined how White identity strategies were related to ideologies legitimizing racial inequalities. Using mixed-methods consisting of qualitative interviews (N = 24) and quantitative surveys (N = 564), we found that White people exhibited different combinations of prideful (“I am a proud person of our ethnic heritage”), dissociated (“My ethnic group does not have a significant impact on how I see the world”), and power-cognizant (“I am a White person with privileges because of my ethnic group”) identity strategies. Moreover, these White identity strategies were associated with linking colonialism and racial inequalities and, thereby, with ideologies legitimizing them. Specifically, White people holding prideful and dissociated strategies were less likely to link colonialism and racial inequalities than White people who exclusively endorsed power-cognizance. Furthermore, power-cognizant people challenged current-day racial inequalities the most. We conclude by discussing how White European people legitimize or question racial inequalities by managing their Whiteness and the theoretical and practical implications of these findings."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n9hcx,2024-02-20,Frequency scaling of unimanual 90° rhythmic coordination: Data and model,"Rachel A. Herth, Qin Zhu, Xiaoye Michael Wang, Geoffrey P Bingham","Two rhythmic coordinations, 0° and 180° relative phase, can be performed stably at preferred frequency (~1 Hz) without training. Evidence indicates that these behavioral modes entail detection of the relative direction of movement that is used as perceptual information to control and coordinate performance. At higher frequencies, this yields instability of 180° and spontaneous transition to 0°. The ability to perform a 90° coordination can be acquired by learning to detect and use relative position as information. Herth, Zhu and Bingham (2021) found that skilled performance of 90° bimanual coordination exhibits mode switching to 0° or 180° with frequency scaling. Unlike the switching from 180° to 0°, transition from a learned coordination to 0° or 180° entails a change in information. They found that neither this switching nor performance of corrections to resist switching entailed intentional decisions during performance. Relatedly, they found that correction is not intrinsic to skilled performance of 90°. They successfully simulated results of frequency scaling of 90° using an extended Bingham model in which switching and correction were initiated as the information for 90° fell below threshold. We now attempt to replicate these findings testing unimanual 90° coordination with noninterference and correcting instructions. With correcting in the previous study, bimanual 90° coordination remained stable at all frequencies while noninterference instructions yielded mode switching at higher frequencies. Snapp-Childs, Wilson and Bingham (2011) showed that unimanual coordination switches at much lower frequencies than bimanual coordination. It is significantly less stable due to coupling that is unidirectional. The current finding was that unimanual performance of 90° fails to remain stable even with correcting at higher frequencies. Results were simulated using a unimanual version of the extended Bingham model."

Muralikrishnan, Christian Fiebach, Alessandro Tavano","Own actions send a corollary discharge (CD) signal, that is a copy of the planned motor program, to sensory-specific brain areas to suppress the anticipated sensory response, providing a neural basis for the sense of self. When we speak, the sensory consequences of the fundamental frequency (f0) of our own voice, generated by vocal fold vibrations, are suppressed. However, due to bone/air conduction filtering effects, the f0 we self-generate is measurably different from the f0 we subjectively perceive as defining our own voice. Using an auditory change deafness paradigm, we parametrically tested the sensitivity to auditory change in the frequency neighbourhoods of individual objective and subjective voice f0, and found that participants experience change deafness for both to a similar extent, relative to a control pitch condition. We conclude that when we listen attentively, we are likely to filter out voice pitches in the vicinity of our own objective and subjective voice f0, possibly as a long-term consequence of speaking-induced suppression mechanisms integrated with individual, perceptual bodily priors."

Depp, Raeanne C. Moore, Philip D. Harvey, Amy Pinkham","Paranoia is a spectrum of fear-related experiences that spans diagnostic categories and is influenced by the environment. The extent to which traditional and digital media use is associated with paranoia remains unknown. We aimed to examine associations between media use and paranoia at the within- and between-person levels. Participants were 409 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder. Measures included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, followed by ecological momentary assessments (EMA) collected three times daily over 30 days. EMA evaluated paranoia and five types of media use: TV, social media, music, reading or writing, and other internet or computer use. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine paranoia as a function of each type of media use and vice-versa. Characteristics associated with lower likelihood of media use included minority ethnoracial status, lower educational attainment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder. There were within-person associations between social media use and subsequently reduced paranoia in the schizophrenia group: fold-change=0.900; 95% CI: 0.840, 0.965; and between listening to music and subsequently decreased paranoia in the bipolar disorder group: fold-change=0.949; 95% CI: 0.906, 0.995. Associations of other media with paranoia were not significant. The associations of social media use and listening to music with reductions in paranoia may reflect clinical benefits of social interaction and distraction. However, systemic inequities and individual factors may hamper the accessibility of certain types of media."

However, most of these interventions target single behaviors that in isolation do not make a significant contribution to sustainable development at large.

We propose that both these shortcomings could be addressed by shifting the focus away from specific behavior changes towards fostering the motivation underlying the engagement in sustainable behaviors."

When faced with conflicting moral values, one adaptive approach is to rely on intuition. While there has been theoretical speculation about the connection between moral decision-making and an individual’s awareness of introspective interoceptive signals, it has not been empirically examined. This study examines this link in the context of decision-making in moral dilemma of university students.  Our research demonstrates a correlation between an individual’s moral intuition towards group consensus and their interoceptive abilities. Study 1 found that interoceptive awareness and the intrinsic functional connectivity of anterior insula are associated with individuals’ moral intuition. Study 2 showed that interoceptive accuracy is associated with moral intuition toward the group consensus. These findings provide empirical evidence of the link between interoceptive abilities and moral intuition towards group consensus."
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hbc5g,2024-02-20,How group life makes personal agency possible,To be fetched,"An uncharitable view of social groups is of autonomy-sapping collectives that stymie personal expression, impose rigid social norms and roles, and force individuals to act in line with “the greater good”, regardless of how good it is for the self. Beyond ungenerous, this view may even be opposite to the role groups play in helping individuals achieve the things they want in life. In this chapter, I argue that—far from hindering personal pursuits—groups can aid them by acting as a source of personal agency, efficacy, and control. More specifically, adopting a social identity approach yields insight into the ways in which belonging to, and identifying with, important groups can help people feel more personally in control of their lives, actions, and outcomes. I outline theoretical and empirical evidence for this argument, as well as discussing conditions under which the group identity–personal control link does and does not operate. This analysis has the potential to provide new insight into the forces that guide human behavior, with consequences for understanding personal outcomes like well-being, as well as group outcomes like collective action. Fundamentally—and perhaps ironically—it may be through others that our own personal agency is unlocked and unleashed to motivate and sustain us."

Beyond ungenerous, this view may even be opposite to the role groups play in helping individuals achieve the things they want in life. In this chapter, I argue that—far from hindering personal pursuits—groups can aid them by acting as a source of personal agency, efficacy, and control. More specifically, adopting a social identity approach yields insight into the ways in which belonging to, and identifying with, important groups can help people feel more personally in control of their lives, actions, and outcomes. I outline theoretical and empirical evidence for this argument, as well as discussing conditions under which the group identity–personal control link does and does not operate. This analysis has the potential to provide new insight into the forces that guide human behavior, with consequences for understanding personal outcomes like well-being, as well as group outcomes like collective action. Fundamentally—and perhaps ironically—it may be through others that our own personal agency is unlocked and unleashed to motivate and sustain us."

When faced with conflicting moral values, one adaptive approach is to rely on intuition. While there has been theoretical speculation about the connection between moral decision-making and an individual’s awareness of introspective interoceptive signals, it has not been empirically examined. This study examines this link in the context of decision-making in moral dilemma of university students.  Our research demonstrates a correlation between an individual’s moral intuition towards group consensus and their interoceptive abilities. Study 1 found that interoceptive awareness and the intrinsic functional connectivity of anterior insula are associated with individuals’ moral intuition. Study 2 showed that interoceptive accuracy is associated with moral intuition toward the group consensus. These findings provide empirical evidence of the link between interoceptive abilities and moral intuition towards group consensus."

However, most of these interventions target single behaviors that in isolation do not make a significant contribution to sustainable development at large. In addition, many interventions fall short of exerting a long-lasting influence on people’s behavior. We propose that both these shortcomings could be addressed by shifting the focus away from specific behavior changes towards fostering the motivation underlying the engagement in sustainable behaviors."

We used a neuroimaging paradigm in which participants (N = 103) were required to project themselves running or plogging (running while picking-up litter) along an image-guided naturalistic trail.

However, children frequently interact with multiple caregivers and/or siblings if they come from homes with multiple caregivers and siblings. Thus, we examined if and how caregiver opportunities to respond (OTRs) varied when sampled across three interaction configurations.   Method: Twelve children with Down syndrome (DS; mean age = 40.82 months) and their biological parents participated in the current study. We collected separate mother-child and father-child dyadic interactions, and one family choice interaction (i.e., both caregivers present and occasionally siblings) in families' homes. We analyzed if differences in the caregiver’s OTR frequency and type—explicit and implicit—existed among dyadic and family choice configurations.  Results: We found that, during family choice interactions, children were exposed to fewer OTRs when combining the total number of father and mother OTRs compared to dyadic caregiver-child interactions. This effect was large for explicit OTRs (mother-dyadic vs. combined family choice: g = -1.99, CI [-3.00, -1.00]; father-dyadic vs. combined family choice: g = -0.84, CI [-1.84, -0.11]). For implicit OTRs, effects were small for mother-dyadic versus combined family choice (g = -0.34, CI [-1.17, 0.48]) and negligible when comparing father-dyadic with combined family choice (g = -0.08, CI [-0.90, 0.73]). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of children's language learning environments to better understand how caregivers support their children's language development."

Our review traces the evolution and continuity of psychological theories of generalization, from origins in concept learning (categorizing stimuli) and function learning (learning continuous input-output relationships), to domains such as reinforcement learning and latent structure learning. Historically, there have been fierce debates between rule-based mechanisms, which rely on explicit hypotheses about environmental structure, and similarity-based mechanisms, which leverage comparisons to prior instances. Each approach has unique advantages: rules support rapid knowledge transfer, while similarity is computationally simple and flexible. Today, these debates have culminated in the development of hybrid models grounded in Bayesian principles, effectively marrying the precision of rules with the flexibility of similarity. The ongoing success of hybrid models not only bridges past dichotomies but also underscores the importance of integrating both rules and similarity for a comprehensive understanding of human generalization."

Gradable adjectives (e.g., ‘tall’ and ‘light’) are a critical example of this process, as their meanings vary depending on the noun with which they are combined. For example, a dark diamond is less dark than dark charcoal. Here, we investigate how a neural network encodes the flexible nature of gradable adjectives in adjective-noun pairs, using the perceptual feature of brightness as a test case. We trained a neural network to predict human brightness ratings for unmodified nouns and adjective-noun pairs and assessed its ability to generalize to untrained combinations (e.g., ‘light paint’ vs. ‘dark paint’). We also explored how this information is encoded. We found that flexible learning of gradable adjectives was possible, with neural networks first making predictions based on the adjective alone, and then modulating these with information from the noun later in learning. We also found that model outputs mimicked the kind of non-additive feature modulation present in human data. Our results have implications for understanding how semantic composition occurs and generate testable predictions for future work."

Participants (N=34, 53% female) rated a random selection of 10 fluent and 10 disfluent memes while we recorded electrodermal (EDA) and electromyographic (EMG) activity. The results show that fluent memes were liked more than disfluent memes and perceived as easier to process. This replicates previous findings that processing fluency impacts the appreciation of internet memes. In the EDA, we found a greater magnitude of skin conductance response (SCR) for disfluent internet memes, suggesting greater arousal during processing.

However, disfluent internet memes had a delay in emotional reactivity, with their first and maximum peak latencies happening significantly later than fluent memes. This was also evident in the first and maximum peak latency of the SCR. This highlights the temporal differences of psychophysiology for fluency and disfluency.

This suggest that the use of non-visual strategies may be sufficient to perform visual working memory tasks, which were previously thought to be strictly visual. To investigate the effects of different strategies on performance in a visual working memory task, we recruited individuals across the visual imagery spectrum and tested their ability to identify relatively small (3 degrees), medium (6 degrees), or large (10 degrees) changes in the degree of orientation of gratings held in working memory. Subsequently, participants indicated the extent to which they used five different strategies: visual, spatial, verbal, semantic, and sensorimotor. Results revealed that individuals with aphantasia and typical imagery performed similarly across all task difficulty levels. Individuals with typical imagery dominantly used visuospatial strategies, but surprisingly, individuals with aphantasia overwhelmingly preferred the use of non-visual spatial and sensorimotor strategies over verbal strategies. These results suggest that non-visual spatial and sensorimotor strategies can be adopted in visual working memory tasks and these strategies are equally efficient as visuospatial strategies. This calls for a rethinking of the “visual” versus “verbal” dichotomy, and provides evidence for the use of other non-visual mental representations in working memory tasks."

Both dopamine signalling and mindfulness have been posited as factors that influence the formation of such routines, yet quantification of their impact remains to be tested in healthy humans. Over two sessions, participants searched through grids of doors to find hidden targets, using a gaze-contingent display. Within each session, door scenes appeared in either one of two colours, with each colour signalling a differing set of likely target locations. We derived measures for how well target locations were learned (target-accuracy), how routine were sets of eye-movements (stereotypy), and the extent of interference between the two scenes (setting-accuracy). Participants completed two sessions, where they were administered either levodopa (dopamine precursor) or placebo (vitamin C), under double-blind counterbalanced conditions. Dopamine and trait mindfulness (assessed by questionnaire) interacted to influence both target-accuracy and stereotypy. Increasing dopamine improved accuracy and reduced stereotypy for high mindfulness scorers, but induced the opposite pattern for low mindfulness scorers. Dopamine also disrupted setting-accuracy invariant to mindfulness. Our findings show that mindfulness modulates the impact of dopamine on the target-accuracy and stereotypy of eye-movement routines, whereas increasing dopamine promotes interference between task-settings, regardless of mindfulness. These findings provide a link between non-human and human models regarding the influence of dopamine on the formation of task-relevant eye-movement routines, and provide novel insights into behaviour-trait factors that modulate the use of experience when building adaptive repertoires."

However, many interventions that encourage individuals to make more sustainable choices do not lead to the desired behavioral change. To tackle this challenge, we take a step back and focus on understanding the complex motivational structure behind sustainable behaviors. We (i) identify individually relevant motives for sustainable behaviors, (ii) show that these motives can be predicted from demographic variables and individuals’ economic preferences, and (iii) discuss how these insights can be used for designing more efficient behavioral interventions.  We base our analysis on rich multinational survey data collected from 1,954 respondents across the United States, China, and the Netherlands. Our approach is based on a novel large language model. We identify 14 motives in 14,262 individual responses to open-ended questions that elicit reasons for seven sustainable behaviors. For example, the motive Health Comfort is the most relevant and most general motive for the behaviors we studied, ranging from showering time to frequency of flying. Individually relevant motives are associated with demographic variables such as gender and age, but also economic preferences. For respondents with a lower discount rate, for example, the motive Electricity Energy is very important, whereas Want Feel is less relevant. Our analysis also reveals striking similarities regarding the relevance and behavioral specificity of motives across the cultures.  When comparing the relevant motives across behaviors, we uncover that behaviors with more overlapping motives are also more positively correlated. This finding offers an explanation of spillover effects caused by implicitly or explicitly appealing to behavioral motives that are relevant for multiple behaviors.  By investigating the motives for multiple behaviors and cultures simultaneously, we are able to generate generalizable and novel insights of cross-cultural importance. These results offer promising pathways towards designing more efficient, targeted interventions focusing on individual motives."

We have recently investigated emotional valence (pleasantness) perception across the parafovea (≤4°) and found that for briefly presented (200ms) emotional face images, positive (happy) valence was affected the least by eccentricity (distance from the center of the visual field) and negative (fearful) valence the most, and these results were not due to response biases. Furthermore, we also found that parafoveal performance at one eccentricity (2°) predicted within- (but not across-) valence performance at another eccentricity (4°). As this was tested with face images of 12 different identities from the established KDEF image-set, it is unclear whether these results would generalize. Here we tested whether these effects replicate with face stimuli of different identities from a different well-established image-set (NimStim) and found (n=37) that all our prior finding replicated. Additionally, we found that the magnitudes of the eccentricity-based modulations with the NimStim stimuli were smaller than those found with the KDEF stimuli (~16.6% performance reduction at 4° for NimStim relative to ~27.3% reduction for KDEF). Our current investigations support our earlier findings that for briefly presented parafoveal stimuli, positive and negative valence perception are dissociated and differently affected by eccentricity. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of investigating emotions beyond central vision, the importance of replication studies, and the importance of using different stimulus sets."

That kind of network thinking is progressive, but it cannot be reliably done purely nomothetically. Average processes are not processes at all, and average networks do not escape the requirement of ergodicity to be applied with confidence to individuals. We will need a more bottom-up change in our measures and research methods to truly understand how mindfulness skills impact people’s lives. Incorporating mindfulness skills into evidence-based care is a positive thing, but how we do it differs from the spiritual and religious traditions that have developed over thousands of years. As empirical clinicians, we need to learn to be wiser and to deploy these skills in a way that makes them safe for individuals and for cultures. Every individual matters in such a journey, and so skills and aspirations of the unique individuals we work with must be measured, modeled, and understood in a way that allows their unique voices to be heard."

We here reveal the underlying oscillatory networks in the human brain by employing directional functional connectivity analysis on source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography data. In our experiment, subjects listened to ambiguous sentences that contained acoustic cues to syntactic structure; in many but not all experimental trials, subjects followed these cues and inferred syntax from the bottom up, as indicated by behavioral responses. In trials where subjects ignored the cues, syntax was inferred from the top down instead. In bottom-up trials, we observed increased connectivity from left to right auditory areas in the upper beta frequency bands. In contrast, top-down trials did not exhibit such connectivity enhancement. Instead, a contradiction between bottom-up cues and top-down inference were associated with theta– and upper-beta-band connectivity from left auditory areas to left frontal/right auditory areas and from right to left frontal areas; also left frontal areas increased its theta-band connectivity to left auditory areas. Conversely, consistency between bottom-up cues and top-down inference increased the alpha band connectivity from the left to right auditory areas. Our results highlight the critical role of directed oscillatory coupling for the functional electrophysiological interaction between distant sensory and abstract subsystems across the greater language brain."

These themes were: (1) belief that Muslims have inherent tendencies towards radicalization; (2) belief that Muslims are Arab/Middle Eastern; (3) belief that Muslims are foreign; (4) identification of Muslims using external visible markers; and, (5) use of Western comparative samples against Muslim samples. The most prevalent theme reflected the belief that Muslims are foreign. Analyses of citation counts revealed that North American publications were most frequently cited accounting for over 60% of citations. Geocoded analysis of the corresponding author’s university affiliation revealed that implicit colonial themes were reflected in publications from North America and Europe, two regions where Muslims are a demographic minority. To our knowledge, this is among the first empirical study demonstrating empirical linkages between coloniality of knowledge about Muslims and references to Muslims in contemporary publications."

Participants then completed a test of both responses and if responses changed. Attention varied across participants and decreased over time. On-task reports after A-D pairs, signaling attention, were associated with recall of D responses when participants were on task during B responses in between- and within-subject analyses, and off task during B responses only in within-subject analysis.

However, traditional model fit index cutoffs like RMSEA ≤ .06 or CFI ≥ .95 were derived to have 90+% sensitivity to misspecification with continuous responses. A disconnect therefore emerges whereby traditional methodological guidelines assume continuous responses whereas empirical data often contain Likert-type responses. We provide an illustrative simulation study to show that this disconnect is not innocuous—sensitivity of traditional cutoffs to misspecification is close to 100% with continuous responses but can fall considerably if 5-point Likert responses are treated as continuous in some conditions. In other conditions, the reverse may occur, and traditional cutoffs may be too strict. Generally, applying traditional cutoffs to Likert-type responses can adversely impact conclusions about fit adequacy. This paper aims to address this prevalent issue by extending the dynamic fit index (DFI) framework to accommodate Likert-type responses. DFI is a simulation-based method that was initially intended to address changes in cutoff sensitivity to misspecification due to model characteristics (e.g., number of items, strength of loadings). Here, we propose extending DFI so that it also accounts for data characteristics (e.g., number of Likert scale points, response distribution) . Two simulations are included to demonstrate that – with 5-point Likert-type responses – the proposed method (a) improves upon traditional cutoffs, (b) improves upon DFI cutoffs based on multivariate normality, and (c) consistently maintains 90+% sensitivity to misspecification."

Both dopamine signalling and mindfulness have been posited as factors that influence the formation of such routines, yet quantification of their impact remains to be tested in healthy humans. Over two sessions, participants searched through grids of doors to find hidden targets, using a gaze-contingent display. Within each session, door scenes appeared in either one of two colours, with each colour signalling a differing set of likely target locations. We derived measures for how well target locations were learned (target-accuracy), how routine were sets of eye-movements (stereotypy), and the extent of interference between the two scenes (setting-accuracy). Participants completed two sessions, where they were administered either levodopa (dopamine precursor) or placebo (vitamin C), under double-blind counterbalanced conditions. Dopamine and trait mindfulness (assessed by questionnaire) interacted to influence both target-accuracy and stereotypy. Increasing dopamine improved accuracy and reduced stereotypy for high mindfulness scorers, but induced the opposite pattern for low mindfulness scorers. Dopamine also disrupted setting-accuracy invariant to mindfulness. Our findings show that mindfulness modulates the impact of dopamine on the target-accuracy and stereotypy of eye-movement routines, whereas increasing dopamine promotes interference between task-settings, regardless of mindfulness. These findings provide a link between non-human and human models regarding the influence of dopamine on the formation of task-relevant eye-movement routines, and provide novel insights into behaviour-trait factors that modulate the use of experience when building adaptive repertoires."

In small samples, however, the IRT likelihood oftentimes contains little informative value, potentially resulting in biased and/or unstable parameter estimates and large standard errors. To facilitate small-sample IRT estimation, we introduce a novel approach for small-sample IRT estimation that does not rely on the likelihood. Our estimation approach capitalizes on item pool information and trains a neural network (NN) to interpolate the relationship between response patterns and item parameters. We describe and evaluate our approach for the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model; however, it is applicable to any model with an item characteristic curve (ICC). Three types of NNs are developed, supporting to obtain both point estimates and confidence intervals for IRT model parameters. The results of a simulation study demonstrated that for sample sizes of 300 and below, these NNs can perform at the level of Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or even better in terms of quality of the point estimates and confidence intervals, but much faster. Among others, these properties facilitate (1) to pretest items in a real-time testing environment (e.g., CAT), (2) to pretest more items and, as a consequence, to replenish operational pools quicker and assemble more tests as well as (3) to pretest items only in a secured environment (e.g., in strictly proctored test centers) to eradicate possible compromise of new items in online testing."

Methods: Six electronic databases and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles and student theses, dissertations, and scholarly projects. Results: Twenty-three articles were identified. All studies examined alcohol use. Ten studies also investigated non-alcoholic substances. No studies assessed behavioral addictions. Overall, findings were mixed, typically revealing no generational differences in substance use or a lower likelihood of substance use or misuse among first-generation students. However, several factors such as gender and race/ethnicity were found to moderate the student generation–substance use relationship, highlighting sub-populations who may be at an increased risk for problematic substance use. Conclusion: Findings emphasize a need for more research examining non-alcoholic substance use and behavioral addictions, as well as factors that may influence associations between generational status and addictive behavior engagement."

Here, we investigated whether this applies to the use of “smart words”, or advanced, sophisticated words assumed to make one sound smart. Participants rated employment suitability of fictitious job applicants based on cover letters that included either a small number of smart words (e.g., “quixotic”) or their regular counterparts (e.g., “impractical”). The results showed that smart words had a significant positive impact on all evaluations of applicants’ skills and personal/intellectual attributes (e.g., relevant experience, decisiveness, aptitude for learning). This finding adds to the growing literature on the role of language in impression formation, and suggests that using as few as eight smart words in a cover letter, in place of less sophisticated synonyms, can put the applicant at a considerable advantage when looking for employment."

These efficacy simulations refer to behaviors, communication strategies, or messages that create a sense of efficacy without actually generating an impact that is proportional to the problem addressed. Together with other patterns like greenwashing, efficacy simulations contribute to the behavior-impact gap in the context of socio-ecological crises. We explore several types of efficacy simulations and their potential implications for individual and collective behavior change. Efficacy simulations may have valid uses, but come with specific risks and may hinder the societal transformations required to address complex socio-ecological challenges. We give recommendations for communications and especially point out the importance of providing reliable information on high-impact individual as well as collective behaviors and measures for sustainable change. By addressing efficacy simulations, policy-makers and agents of socio-ecological change can develop more effective communication strategies to foster meaningful behavior change and contribute to a sustainable future."

However, it remains unclear to what extent childhood family SES relates to brain functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, the present study investigated the associations between retrospective accounts of objective and subjective childhood family SES and two well-established electrophysiological indices of brain functioning in adulthood—the MMN and P3b event-related potentials (ERP) components. Higher objective childhood family SES, as proxied by parent educational attainment in childhood, was associated with larger (more positive) P3b amplitudes in adulthood. In contrast, there was no association between childhood parent educational attainment and the magnitude of MMN. Adult reports of subjective family SES during childhood were not related to the magnitude of MMN or P3b. These findings suggest that the links between childhood SES and brain functioning may extend into adulthood, especially for brain functions supporting cognitive control. These results also imply that, when using retrospective accounts of childhood family SES with adults, objective indicators may outperform subjective reports of childhood family SES in predicting adult brain functioning. Our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations on how and why childhood family SES relates to brain functioning in adulthood."

Findings from Two Longitudinal Studies of Aging,To be fetched,"Objective: Most work on rural-urban health disparities has been conducted with population-level data, which is limited in its capacity for causal inferences about individuals and lifespan health. The present study leverages individual-level longitudinal data, spanning up to 29 years, to understand how rurality-urbanicity predicts risk for all-cause mortality; whether these associations hold above and beyond socioeconomic status; and whether the association between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk varies by sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and partner status. Methods: The present pre-registered study uses data from two large longitudinal studies of U.S. Americans (HRS and MIDUS; total N = ~55,000), who reported on their socio-demographic characteristics, had their addresses linked to geographical indicators (i.e., rural-urban continuum codes), and have data from the National Death Index regarding vital status and survival time.  Results: Using cox proportional hazards regression models, findings showed that suburban and rural residents were at a 12% and 18% greater risk for earlier mortality compared to urban residents in HRS, but the associations between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk were non-significant in MIDUS. The longitudinal associations between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk were largely independent of socioeconomic status. Finally, there was only one statistically significant interaction effect, suggesting the strength and direction of the association between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk was largely the same across sociodemographic subgroups.  Conclusions: There is tentative evidence suggesting that rurality-urbanicity is an important social determinant of longevity, over and above other sociodemographic factors. Future studies should explore how to promote longer and healthier lives among rural residents."

These efficacy simulations refer to behaviors, communication strategies, or messages that create a sense of efficacy without actually generating an impact that is proportional to the problem addressed. Together with other patterns like greenwashing, efficacy simulations contribute to the behavior-impact gap in the context of socio-ecological crises. We explore several types of efficacy simulations and their potential implications for individual and collective behavior change. Efficacy simulations may have valid uses, but come with specific risks and may hinder the societal transformations required to address complex socio-ecological challenges. We give recommendations for communications and especially point out the importance of providing reliable information on high-impact individual as well as collective behaviors and measures for sustainable change. By addressing efficacy simulations, policy-makers and agents of socio-ecological change can develop more effective communication strategies to foster meaningful behavior change and contribute to a sustainable future."

Here, we investigated whether this applies to the use of “smart words”, or advanced, sophisticated words assumed to make one sound smart. Participants rated employment suitability of fictitious job applicants based on cover letters that included either a small number of smart words (e.g., “quixotic”) or their regular counterparts (e.g., “impractical”). The results showed that smart words had a significant positive impact on all evaluations of applicants’ skills and personal/intellectual attributes (e.g., relevant experience, decisiveness, aptitude for learning). This finding adds to the growing literature on the role of language in impression formation, and suggests that using as few as eight smart words in a cover letter, in place of less sophisticated synonyms, can put the applicant at a considerable advantage when looking for employment."

However, it remains unclear to what extent childhood family SES relates to brain functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, the present study investigated the associations between retrospective accounts of objective and subjective childhood family SES and two well-established electrophysiological indices of brain functioning in adulthood—the MMN and P3b event-related potentials (ERP) components. Higher objective childhood family SES, as proxied by parent educational attainment in childhood, was associated with larger (more positive) P3b amplitudes in adulthood. In contrast, there was no association between childhood parent educational attainment and the magnitude of MMN. Adult reports of subjective family SES during childhood were not related to the magnitude of MMN or P3b. These findings suggest that the links between childhood SES and brain functioning may extend into adulthood, especially for brain functions supporting cognitive control. These results also imply that, when using retrospective accounts of childhood family SES with adults, objective indicators may outperform subjective reports of childhood family SES in predicting adult brain functioning. Our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations on how and why childhood family SES relates to brain functioning in adulthood."

Methods: Six electronic databases and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles and student theses, dissertations, and scholarly projects. Results: Twenty-three articles were identified. All studies examined alcohol use. Ten studies also investigated non-alcoholic substances. No studies assessed behavioral addictions. Overall, findings were mixed, typically revealing no generational differences in substance use or a lower likelihood of substance use or misuse among first-generation students. However, several factors such as gender and race/ethnicity were found to moderate the student generation–substance use relationship, highlighting sub-populations who may be at an increased risk for problematic substance use. Conclusion: Findings emphasize a need for more research examining non-alcoholic substance use and behavioral addictions, as well as factors that may influence associations between generational status and addictive behavior engagement."

The commentary further explores the limitations of current methodologies in artificial consciousness research, pointing to the necessity of out-of-the-box thinking and the integration of individual differences research in cognitive psychology, particularly in the areas of attention, cognitive control, autobiographical memory, and Theory of Mind (ToM), to advance the understanding and development of artificial consciousness."

In small samples, however, the IRT likelihood oftentimes contains little informative value, potentially resulting in biased and/or unstable parameter estimates and large standard errors. To facilitate small-sample IRT estimation, we introduce a novel approach for small-sample IRT estimation that does not rely on the likelihood. Our estimation approach capitalizes on item pool information and trains a neural network (NN) to interpolate the relationship between response patterns and item parameters. We describe and evaluate our approach for the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model; however, it is applicable to any model with an item characteristic curve (ICC). Three types of NNs are developed, supporting to obtain both point estimates and confidence intervals for IRT model parameters. The results of a simulation study demonstrated that for sample sizes of 300 and below, these NNs can perform at the level of Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or even better in terms of quality of the point estimates and confidence intervals, but much faster. Among others, these properties facilitate (1) to pretest items in a real-time testing environment (e.g., CAT), (2) to pretest more items and, as a consequence, to replenish operational pools quicker and assemble more tests as well as (3) to pretest items only in a secured environment (e.g., in strictly proctored test centers) to eradicate possible compromise of new items in online testing."

Prior research suggests that individuals vary in their use of strategies and that some strategies are more effective than others. To my knowledge, only one study has explicitly assessed whether strategy use affects what is measured by paired-associate tasks. In three studies, I investigated whether the predictive validities of fluid intelligence and working memory capacity differ as a consequence of using elaborative or non-elaborative strategies in paired-associate learning. Additionally, I attempted to replicate prior work investigating individual differences in spontaneous strategy use as well as the effect of strategy use on paired-associate learning performance.  In Study 1, I found that most individuals used elaborative strategies, however, roughly 1 in 8 participants primarily used non-elaborative strategies. Across all studies, individuals using elaborative strategies significantly outperformed those using non-elaborative strategies in paired-associative learning. The effect of strategy use on the validities of the predictors was more ambiguous. In Study 1 and 2, which used the same learning materials, strategy use did not appear to moderate the relationships between the predictors and paired-associate learning. In Study 3, which used a different set of stimuli, strategy use did appear to moderate the relationship between the predictors and paired-associate learning. Differences in results may be due to the different stimuli used across studies but more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn."

Scholars pinpoint economic inequalities between ethnic groups as a major cause of such violence. However, the relationships between group-based inequality, group-based injustice, and political violence are not well understood. Combining insights from social psychological research on collective action and political science research on civil conflict, we underscore that it is group-based injustice that motivates violence. A perception that one’s group has been treated unfairly tends to produce conflict-related emotions (e.g., anger). By contrast, a mere perception that one’s group is of lower economic status rarely produces such affect. Furthermore, perceived economic disadvantage negatively relates to perceived political efficacy, which may dissuade engagement in political violence. To assess these arguments, we analyzed attitudes toward, intentions to engage, and self-reported engagement in political violence, utilizing probability samples from 18 African countries (N &gt; 37,000). We found that measures of group-based perceived injustice, controlling for group-based economic inequality, predicted all violent outcomes. By contrast, measures of perceived group-based inequality, controlling for group-based injustice, negatively related to self-reported participation in violence and did not predict attitudes toward, and intentions to engage in, violence. We advance both social psychological and political science literatures, suggesting that group-based injustice and inequality are distinct constructs, relating to political violence via different pathways."

However, labor-intensive data collection and processing limit the speed at which this understanding can be advanced. Here, we demonstrate a fully asynchronous, automated workflow for conducting Violation-of-Expectation (VoE) experiments. We first replicate four classic VoE experiments in a synchronous online setting, and show that VoE can generate highly replicable effects through remote testing. We then confirm the accuracy of a state-of-the- art gaze annotation software, iCatcher+ in a new setting. Third, we train parents to control the experiment flow based on the infant's gaze. Combining all three innovations, we then conduct an asynchronous automated infant-contingent VoE experiment. The automatic workflow successfully replicates a classic VoE effect: infants look longer at inefficient actions than efficient ones. We compare the resulting effect size and statistical power to the same study run in-lab and synchronously via Zoom. The automated workflow significantly reduces the marginal cost and time per participant, enabling larger sample sizes. By enhancing the reproducibility and robustness of findings relying on infant looking, this workflow could help support a cumulative science of infant cognition. Tools to implement the workflow are openly available."

Although missed observations are common in ESM, their effect on the estimation performance of the MLAR model remains underexplored. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and variance of the fixed autoregressive effect estimator in the MLAR model. In a simulation study, we show that the presence of missing data increases both bias and variance. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and when the missingness is tail-based (i.e., when the missingness depends on the process value itself). The conclusions hold regardless of whether the random autoregressive effects are estimated or not. We corroborate these results by setting data of an empirical ESM dataset to missing following the same principles. To lower the estimation bias and variance, we recommend making design choices to promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling."

We present data from two experiments where adult participants completed a visual ratio comparison task with stimuli consisting of ratios of numerosities of sets of dots. Results revealed that, at the group level, the logarithmic distance model provided a superior fit to participants' responses and response times compared to the linear model.

The study of social cognitive functioning in old age is of practical importance, as links between social cognition functioning have been linked to loneliness, negative health outcomes, and problems maintaining good relationships for older adults (Carton, Kessler &amp; Pape, 1999; Henry, Phillips, Ruffman &amp; Bailey, 2013). In the current study, age differences in cognitive and social cognitive function were examined. In order to examine this link, participants were presented with a battery of cognitive tests, a social skills inventory, and an emotional faces recognition task. Relationships between measures of cognitive function and measures of social cognitive function were examined. Younger adults performed better than older adults on measures of cognitive function, but not on the Social Skills Inventory (Riggio &amp; Carmey, 2003). Both younger and older adults demonstrated a positivity effect when identifying emotions in faces; older adults to a greater extent. This indicates that while both age groups are better at recognizing positive versus negative emotions, older adults are differentially better at doing so. An important question, however, is whether this difference is driven by loss in ability to identify negative emotions or increased ability to process positive emotions. This study adds to our understanding of the complex interactions between gains and losses; competencies and deficiencies in older adulthood."

These changes influence learning rates, but it is less clear how they influence perception. A recent theory suggests that surprising observations trigger a reactive noradrenaline release, increasing sensory gain. Environmental changes would thereby elicit a perceptual boost, and this perceptual boost would optimise model updating. To test this account, we asked whether surprising events boost detection of the surprising events themselves, and of other incidental events presented simultaneously. In four online experiments, participants were required to detect a feature of visual stimuli presented peripherally, alongside presence of a stimulus at fixation. Peripheral stimulus location was drawn from a truncated normal distribution, the mean of which changed once without warning during the task. We modelled a surprise-induced weighting factor, based on Bayesian Changepoint Modelling, to ask whether the distribution change inflated hitrates both of features of the peripheral event, which themselves generated the surprise, and of simultaneous fixation events. We instead, unexpectedly, found consistently lower hitrates on surprising trials for all event types. These findings suggest that surprising observations do not automatically increase sensory gain across channels, but instead that foraging for new information operates slowly, or that neural error processing enables model updating without enhancing perception."

Yet, these relational dimensions, manifesting across various levels from individual interactions to group dynamics, are frequently overlooked in therapeutic procedures and assessments. This paper presents a multi-level perspective that seeks to integrate principles from somatic psychology with insights for individuals and collectives from developmental, evolutionary and contemplative sciences, in order to offer a novel somatico-developmental framework for enhancing trauma-healing methodologies. We introduce the ""Relational Embodiment"" 2-weeks residency program as a case study and delineate an ecology of nervous systems regulation and developmental practices across the Self, Dyadic, Group, and Community levels. These incorporate meditation, individual therapy, group sessions, and collective tasks, suggesting an encompassing multi-level therapeutic model. We discuss limitations of this approach and recommend research directions that combine quantitative tools for physiological and relational measurements with qualitative methods such as participant-driven journaling. Finally, we propose that methods rooted in participatory action research can not only yield context-specific data but also enhance individual therapeutic processes. In conclusion, this paper offers a practical multi-level framework emphasizing the importance of interpersonal dynamics in somatic therapeutic contexts."

Moreover, they can later remember what these events were (memory). Here we investigate how the relationship between actions and events shapes agency experience and memory for the corresponding events. Participants performed actions which produced stimuli that were either congruent or incongruent to the action while memory of these stimuli was probed in a recognition test. Additionally, predictability of the effect was manipulated in Experiment 1 by using either randomly interleaved or blocked ordering of action-congruent and action-incongruent events. In Experiment 2, the size of the action space was manipulated by allowing participants to choose between three or six possible responses. The results indicated a heightened sense of agency following congruent compared to incongruent trials, with this effect being increased given a larger available action space, as well as a greater sense of agency given higher predictability of the effect. Recognition memory was better for stimuli presented in congruent compared to incongruent trials, with no discernible effects of effect predictability or the size of the action space. The results point towards a joint influence of predictive and postdictive processes on agency experience and suggest a link between control and memory. The partial dissociation of influences on agency experience and memory cast doubt on a mediating role of agency experience on the relationship between action-effect congruency and memory. Theoretical accounts for this relationship are discussed."

Moreover, they can later remember what these events were (memory). Here we investigate how the relationship between actions and events shapes agency experience and memory for the corresponding events. Participants performed actions which produced stimuli that were either congruent or incongruent to the action while memory of these stimuli was probed in a recognition test. Additionally, predictability of the effect was manipulated in Experiment 1 by using either randomly interleaved or blocked ordering of action-congruent and action-incongruent events. In Experiment 2, the size of the action space was manipulated by allowing participants to choose between three or six possible responses. The results indicated a heightened sense of agency following congruent compared to incongruent trials, with this effect being increased given a larger available action space, as well as a greater sense of agency given higher predictability of the effect. Recognition memory was better for stimuli presented in congruent compared to incongruent trials, with no discernible effects of effect predictability or the size of the action space. The results point towards a joint influence of predictive and postdictive processes on agency experience and suggest a link between control and memory. The partial dissociation of influences on agency experience and memory cast doubt on a mediating role of agency experience on the relationship between action-effect congruency and memory. Theoretical accounts for this relationship are discussed."

Feldman, Liubov Tupikina, Marc Santolini","The ongoing exploration of the human nervous system, particularly informed by Stephen Porges' Polyvagal theory, draws attention to the roles of the vagus nerve and the importance of interpersonal relationships in therapeutic settings. Yet, these relational dimensions, manifesting across various levels from individual interactions to group dynamics, are frequently overlooked in therapeutic procedures and assessments. This paper presents a multi-level perspective that seeks to integrate principles from somatic psychology with insights for individuals and collectives from developmental, evolutionary and contemplative sciences, in order to offer a novel somatico-developmental framework for enhancing trauma-healing methodologies. We introduce the ""Relational Embodiment"" 2-weeks residency program as a case study and delineate an ecology of nervous systems regulation and developmental practices across the Self, Dyadic, Group, and Community levels. These incorporate meditation, individual therapy, group sessions, and collective tasks, suggesting an encompassing multi-level therapeutic model. We discuss limitations of this approach and recommend research directions that combine quantitative tools for physiological and relational measurements with qualitative methods such as participant-driven journaling. Finally, we propose that methods rooted in participatory action research can not only yield context-specific data but also enhance individual therapeutic processes. In conclusion, this paper offers a practical multi-level framework emphasizing the importance of interpersonal dynamics in somatic therapeutic contexts."

These changes influence learning rates, but it is less clear how they influence perception. A recent theory suggests that surprising observations trigger a reactive noradrenaline release, increasing sensory gain. Environmental changes would thereby elicit a perceptual boost, and this perceptual boost would optimise model updating. To test this account, we asked whether surprising events boost detection of the surprising events themselves, and of other incidental events presented simultaneously. In four online experiments, participants were required to detect a feature of visual stimuli presented peripherally, alongside presence of a stimulus at fixation. Peripheral stimulus location was drawn from a truncated normal distribution, the mean of which changed once without warning during the task. We modelled a surprise-induced weighting factor, based on Bayesian Changepoint Modelling, to ask whether the distribution change inflated hitrates both of features of the peripheral event, which themselves generated the surprise, and of simultaneous fixation events. We instead, unexpectedly, found consistently lower hitrates on surprising trials for all event types. These findings suggest that surprising observations do not automatically increase sensory gain across channels, but instead that foraging for new information operates slowly, or that neural error processing enables model updating without enhancing perception."

Although missed observations are common in ESM, their effect on the estimation performance of the MLAR model remains underexplored. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and variance of the fixed autoregressive effect estimator in the MLAR model. In a simulation study, we show that the presence of missing data increases both bias and variance. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and when the missingness is tail-based (i.e., when the missingness depends on the process value itself). The conclusions hold regardless of whether the random autoregressive effects are estimated or not. We corroborate these results by setting data of an empirical ESM dataset to missing following the same principles. To lower the estimation bias and variance, we recommend making design choices to promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling."

Prior research suggests that individuals vary in their use of strategies and that some strategies are more effective than others. To my knowledge, only one study has explicitly assessed whether strategy use affects what is measured by paired-associate tasks. In three studies, I investigated whether the predictive validities of fluid intelligence and working memory capacity differ as a consequence of using elaborative or non-elaborative strategies in paired-associate learning. Additionally, I attempted to replicate prior work investigating individual differences in spontaneous strategy use as well as the effect of strategy use on paired-associate learning performance.  In Study 1, I found that most individuals used elaborative strategies, however, roughly 1 in 8 participants primarily used non-elaborative strategies. Across all studies, individuals using elaborative strategies significantly outperformed those using non-elaborative strategies in paired-associative learning. The effect of strategy use on the validities of the predictors was more ambiguous. In Study 1 and 2, which used the same learning materials, strategy use did not appear to moderate the relationships between the predictors and paired-associate learning. In Study 3, which used a different set of stimuli, strategy use did appear to moderate the relationship between the predictors and paired-associate learning. Differences in results may be due to the different stimuli used across studies but more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn."

Scholars pinpoint economic inequalities between ethnic groups as a major cause of such violence. However, the relationships between group-based inequality, group-based injustice, and political violence are not well understood. Combining insights from social psychological research on collective action and political science research on civil conflict, we underscore that it is group-based injustice that motivates violence. A perception that one’s group has been treated unfairly tends to produce conflict-related emotions (e.g., anger). By contrast, a mere perception that one’s group is of lower economic status rarely produces such affect. Furthermore, perceived economic disadvantage negatively relates to perceived political efficacy, which may dissuade engagement in political violence. To assess these arguments, we analyzed attitudes toward, intentions to engage, and self-reported engagement in political violence, utilizing probability samples from 18 African countries (N &gt; 37,000). We found that measures of group-based perceived injustice, controlling for group-based economic inequality, predicted all violent outcomes. By contrast, measures of perceived group-based inequality, controlling for group-based injustice, negatively related to self-reported participation in violence and did not predict attitudes toward, and intentions to engage in, violence. We advance both social psychological and political science literatures, suggesting that group-based injustice and inequality are distinct constructs, relating to political violence via different pathways."

However, labor-intensive data collection and processing limit the speed at which this understanding can be advanced. Here, we demonstrate a fully asynchronous, automated workflow for conducting Violation-of-Expectation (VoE) experiments. We first replicate four classic VoE experiments in a synchronous online setting, and show that VoE can generate highly replicable effects through remote testing. We then confirm the accuracy of a state-of-the- art gaze annotation software, iCatcher+ in a new setting. Third, we train parents to control the experiment flow based on the infant's gaze. Combining all three innovations, we then conduct an asynchronous automated infant-contingent VoE experiment. The automatic workflow successfully replicates a classic VoE effect: infants look longer at inefficient actions than efficient ones. We compare the resulting effect size and statistical power to the same study run in-lab and synchronously via Zoom. The automated workflow significantly reduces the marginal cost and time per participant, enabling larger sample sizes. By enhancing the reproducibility and robustness of findings relying on infant looking, this workflow could help support a cumulative science of infant cognition. Tools to implement the workflow are openly available."

Due to the use of multifaceted tasks in prior research, it is unclear precisely which cognitive functions are implicated. We aimed to assess the acute effects of the (joint) ingestion of cocoa flavanols and caffeine on temporal attention, spatial attention, and working memory. In four separate sessions of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, our participants consumed a placebo drink, a drink containing cocoa flavanols (415 mg), a drink containing caffeine (215 mg), and a drink containing both concurrently. In each session, after ingestion, we tested performance in three cognitive tasks. We tested temporal attention in a dual-target rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, known to elicit the attentional blink, in which the lag between the targets was manipulated. We measured spatial attention in a visual search task, where we varied the number of distractors that appeared simultaneously with the target. We tested working memory in a delayed recall task, in which the number of stimuli to be maintained was manipulated. We obtained the expected performance pattern in each task, but found no evidence for modulation of response accuracy or response times by the ingestion of either substance, nor of their combined ingestion, even in the most challenging task conditions. We conclude that, even when jointly ingested, neither the tested amount of cocoa flavanols nor caffeine have acute effects that are robustly measurable on cognitive tasks that target attention and working memory individually."

Embodiment, on the other hand, argues that the body plays an important role in processes that have classically been characterized as mental. We argue that decision making is facilitated by reducing the amount of mental computation (less-is-more) through the exploitation of the constant stream of rich sensorimotor information (embodiment), a concept we call LIME. LIME argues that, via embodiment, computation is ‘constrained’ by and ‘off-loaded’ into the body. Constraining involves the body reducing the input or generated options before they enter into mental computation. Off-loading involves the body or the environment performing the computation. LIME underlies cognition generally, but is most accessibly demonstrated in sport phenomena, and we use this domain to sketch out the breadth of this concept in four case studies. LIME connects first principles of cognition to real life phenomena, providing a mechanics to ecological rationality and naturalistic behavior."

The legislation required food outlets belonging to large (&gt;250 employees) businesses in England selling food for immediate consumption to provide kcal labelling on all unpackaged food and non-alcoholic drinks. We examined whether the implementation of this policy was associated with a change in consumer behaviour in the OHFS.   Design: Observational study. Setting: OHFS outlets subject to the policy in four areas of England.  Participants: From August-December 2021 (pre-implementation) and August-December 2022 (post-implementation), researchers visited the same large OHFS outlets subject to kcal labelling legislation and conducted customer exit surveys. 6578 customers (3308 pre-implementation and 3270 post-implementation) from 330 outlets were surveyed.  Main outcome measures: The number of kcals purchased and consumed by customers, customers' knowledge of the kcal content of their purchases, and the extent to which customers noticed and used kcal labelling.  Results: At baseline, mean energy purchased (mean, M=1007 kcals, SD = 630) and consumed (M=909 kcals, SD = 548) per customer was high compared to national guidance. There were no changes in energy purchased pre vs. post-implementation (difference pre vs. post, B = 11.31, [95% CI: -27.15 to 49.77], p= 0.564) or consumed (B=18.51, [95% CI: -15.01 to 52.03], p= 0.279) for adjusted findings. Post-implementation, participants underestimated the energy content of their purchased meal less (B = 61.21, [95% CI: 21.57 to 100.86], p&lt;0.001), were more likely to report noticing (odds ratio, OR post vs. pre = 2.25 [95% CI: 1.84 to 2.73], p&lt;0.001) and using of kcal labelling (OR = 2.15 [95% CI: 1.62 to 2.85], p &lt;0.001) compared to pre-implementation.  Conclusions: The introduction of the mandatory kcal labelling policy in England was not associated with a significant decrease in the number of kcals purchased or consumed in OHFS outlets.  Although a lack of compliance with labelling legislation found in previous research may have contributed to the lack of change in energy purchased and consumed observed in the present study. Improved accuracy of meal energy estimations and increased reporting of noticing and use of kcal labelling were observed and this may have wider public health implications.

However, this effect lacks consistency, with many studies excluding the period of midlife. This study summarized cross-sectional studies on adult age and prosociality, combining 120 (independent) samples (n = 103,829) in a lifespan meta-analysis approach. Linear and quadratic age effects on prosociality were analyzed, as well as comparisons between younger, middle-aged, and older adults. Prosociality was assessed via behavioral measures and self-reports. In both these domains, results indicated small linear age effects and higher prosociality in older compared to younger adults, supporting the hypothesis of increased prosociality in older age. Additionally, leveraging open data sets (64/120 independent samples), predominantly unpublished, we found quadratic age effects on behavioral prosociality. Middle-aged adults exhibited higher behavioral and self-reported prosociality than younger adults, but no differences between middle-aged and older adults were observed. This meta-analysis offers new perspectives on age trajectories of prosociality, revealing midlife as a potentially important phase of pronounced prosociality."

Friedrich, Patricia Grove, Maša Iskra, Sandra Ittlinger, Lisa Koop, Markus Raab, Laura Voigt","Less-is-more describes a principle underlying decision making. Embodiment, on the other hand, argues that the body plays an important role in processes that have classically been characterized as mental. We argue that decision making is facilitated by reducing the amount of mental computation (less-is-more) through the exploitation of the constant stream of rich sensorimotor information (embodiment), a concept we call LIME. LIME argues that, via embodiment, computation is ‘constrained’ by and ‘off-loaded’ into the body. Constraining involves the body reducing the input or generated options before they enter into mental computation. Off-loading involves the body or the environment performing the computation. LIME underlies cognition generally, but is most accessibly demonstrated in sport phenomena, and we use this domain to sketch out the breadth of this concept in four case studies. LIME connects first principles of cognition to real life phenomena, providing a mechanics to ecological rationality and naturalistic behavior."

The legislation required food outlets belonging to large (&gt;250 employees) businesses in England selling food for immediate consumption to provide kcal labelling on all unpackaged food and non-alcoholic drinks. We examined whether the implementation of this policy was associated with a change in consumer behaviour in the OHFS.   Design: Observational study. Setting: OHFS outlets subject to the policy in four areas of England.  Participants: From August-December 2021 (pre-implementation) and August-December 2022 (post-implementation), researchers visited the same large OHFS outlets subject to kcal labelling legislation and conducted customer exit surveys. 6578 customers (3308 pre-implementation and 3270 post-implementation) from 330 outlets were surveyed.  Main outcome measures: The number of kcals purchased and consumed by customers, customers' knowledge of the kcal content of their purchases, and the extent to which customers noticed and used kcal labelling.  Results: At baseline, mean energy purchased (mean, M=1007 kcals, SD = 630) and consumed (M=909 kcals, SD = 548) per customer was high compared to national guidance. There were no changes in energy purchased pre vs. post-implementation (difference pre vs. post, B = 11.31, [95% CI: -27.15 to 49.77], p= 0.564) or consumed (B=18.51, [95% CI: -15.01 to 52.03], p= 0.279) for adjusted findings. Post-implementation, participants underestimated the energy content of their purchased meal less (B = 61.21, [95% CI: 21.57 to 100.86], p&lt;0.001), were more likely to report noticing (odds ratio, OR post vs. pre = 2.25 [95% CI: 1.84 to 2.73], p&lt;0.001) and using of kcal labelling (OR = 2.15 [95% CI: 1.62 to 2.85], p &lt;0.001) compared to pre-implementation.  Conclusions: The introduction of the mandatory kcal labelling policy in England was not associated with a significant decrease in the number of kcals purchased or consumed in OHFS outlets.  Although a lack of compliance with labelling legislation found in previous research may have contributed to the lack of change in energy purchased and consumed observed in the present study. Improved accuracy of meal energy estimations and increased reporting of noticing and use of kcal labelling were observed and this may have wider public health implications.

The bias occurs when one is (i) aware that some evidence is more likely given one hypothesis rather than another, but (ii) that evidence does not cause them to raise their probability for the former hypothesis relative to the latter. The Monty Hall problem illustrates this bias, although the bias is potentially present in other contexts. Unlike previous studies, the present study shows that incorrect responses to the problem are attributable to failure to realize the implications of likelihoods (i.e. likelihood neglect) instead of unawareness of what the likelihoods are. Likelihood neglect is also distinguished from other biases which it is occasionally confused with, and a theoretical explanation of likelihood neglect is proposed. Experimental results also indicate that a new approach—the mental simulations approach—showed a large effect in reducing likelihood neglect and increasing correct probabilities when encountering the Monty Hall problem. The approach also increased correct probabilities for a new modification called the “New Monty Hall problem”, unlike two prominent alternative approaches to the original Monty Hall problem."

To investigate, we evaluated eleven behavioral interventions aimed at stimulating climate change mitigation, along cultural individualism and collectivism orientations, in a large sample (N=59,440) spanning 63 countries. At baseline, we found the more individualistic a nation, the less its residents believed in climate change, supported mitigation policy, and intended to share information, but did not plant fewer trees in an online task. Critically, while some interventions were more effective in individualistic (decreasing psychological distance), and some in collectivistic nations (emphasizing social norms), others were effective in both (writing a letter to the future generation). These results reveal that individualism is a significant barrier to climate mitigation, and the efficacy of interventions hinges on cultural contexts."

During school closures, the home literacy environment (HLE) is of great importance for developing and maintaining early reading skills; however, little is known about changes in HLE during COVID-19.  Method Across five English-speaking countries, 1,411 families with 2,412 children (ages 0-11; 92% White) responded to an online questionnaire characterizing their HLE before and since COVID-19 restrictions. The researcher-developed questionnaire included items on home literacy resources, enrichment activities, and reading at home behaviors, as well as background information on the families. Almost half of all families (n=709; 50%) indicated having a family member with at least one area of learning difficulty.  Results Ordinal logistic regression showed decreases in physical books as well as increases in digital materials, enrichments activities, and (shared) reading at home. These changes depended on child age, type of COVID-19 restrictions, family history of learning difficulties, and employment changes, but not on SES or the number of adults at home. Families with a history of learning difficulties reported spending less time on shared and independent reading, with greater decreases since COVID-19. Conclusion Our results highlight important environmental factors that can affect educational outcomes and inform the development of policies around literacy practices and interventions aimed to minimize the long-term impact of school closures (e.g., related to public health recommendations, natural catathrophes, extended summer breaks or teacher strikes)."

Theories in cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology and animal cognition tend to assume a strong connection between information seeking behaviour and explicit metacognition – conscious introspection about our mental states and subjective metacognitive feelings like confidence or uncertainty. However, recent developments in computational neuroscience have stressed that metacognition and uncertainty are not equivalent, and many forms of uncertainty may be monitored in the brain without generating subjective metacognitive feelings. Here, across a series of experiments in adult humans, we show that information seeking and subjective confidence are controlled by distinct forms of uncertainty. In particular, information seeking (but not confidence) is controlled by uncertainty in sampled sensory evidence while confidence (but not information seeking) is controlled by uncertainty caused by decision boundaries. This double dissociation suggests that separate computations in the mind and brain shape confidence and information seeking: undermining the idea that information seeking behaviour always depends on conscious introspection into our own states of mind."

In visual perception, evidence has shown that the reported perception can be biased away from the prior stimulus even when the stimulus is completely irrelevant to the task at hand. Prevailing theories suggest that this repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level visual processes (i.e., adaptation), directly impacting the perception of the stimulus itself. The present study tested this hypothesis by investigating the speed of response in a continuous motion direction estimation task commonly used in serial bias studies. We predicted that the response time (RT) for motion reports should be independent of prior motion direction if the repulsive serial bias reflects the changes in the representation driven by the low-level adaptation mechanism. However, results showed a systematic modulation of RT by prior motion direction, with RT being faster for larger direction differences. Follow-up experiments replicated this finding and further demonstrated that the RT effect occurred only when the repulsive serial bias was present, indicating that the repulsive serial bias and response time effect are the products of the same underlying processes. These results provide converging evidence that prior stimulus not only biases but also impacts the speed of decision for a new stimulus, demonstrating that the low-level adaptation mechanism alone is not sufficient to account for the repulsive serial bias. Theories in serial bias should incorporate decision-making mechanisms that modulate the speed of response in relation to the biases in the reports."

When we diminished resources commonly implicated in observational perspective-taking, coordination performance also diminished. In this study, we expand on these findings to test whether performance could be improved by bolstering such resources. Participant dyads performed an iterated turn-based pure coordination task before and after one of three brief (~10 minute) interventions: focused-attention meditation (which has been shown to improve working memory), loving-kindness meditation (which increases integration of self- and other-oriented perspectives), or a neutral control. Using intermittent thought probes, we also assessed the degree to which participants across interventions engaged in mind-wandering, as well as the degree to which their attention was oriented towards either self-generated or other-generated actions. We found no significant differences in the effects of the interventions on mean coordination performance or thought probe responses. The loving-kindness meditation marginally enhanced trial-by-trial improvement in performance time-series when compared to the control. Dyads performed significantly better when other-oriented and showed greater convergence on shared decision rules over time than when self-oriented. On-task thought marginally decreased the number of trials needed for participants to align their responses, with significantly better performance on initial trials when on-task compared to when mind-wandering.

One possible explanation are vague theories that do not specify which level of analysis is of interest. We illustrate such a case using the construct of self-compassion. The factor structure at the BP level has been highly debated, although the theory is actually concerned with relationships at the WP level. Method: Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was applied to experience-sampling data of self-compassion (N = 213, with n = 4,052 measurement occasions). Results: At both levels of analysis, evidence for a two-factor model was found. However, the factors were moderately related at the WP level (r = .37, p &lt; .001) but largely independent at the BP level (r = .04, p = .696). Exploratory analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity in the WP relationship among individuals. Conclusion: We discuss how our results provide new impulses to move the debate around self-compassion forward. Lastly, we outline how the WP level – which is of major interest for self- compassion and other constructs in psychology – can guide the conceptualization and assessment to promote advancements of the theory and resulting applications."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/t9dvh,2024-02-15,Detecting social biases using mental state inference,To be fetched,"Social biases are prevalent in everyday social interactions, but they are often expressed in subtle ways that can make them difficult to detect. Yet, intuitively, people can often recognize when they are the subject of a bias, even in the absence of any overt behavior. How do we do this? While much research has focused on the negative consequences of being the subject of a bias, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms that allow people to explicitly detect biases in the first place. In this paper, we propose an account of bias detection which is grounded on mental state representations. We propose that people infer biases by detecting a gap between expected unbiased behavior and observed real-world behavior, which in turns reveals the hidden biases influencing other people's beliefs. We present a formal computational model of this account and, across three preregistered studies (n=720 total), we show that this model captures participants' inferences about an observer's prior beliefs (Experiment 1), general social biases (Experiment 2), and specific real-world biases (Experiments 3a--3c). Moreover, our model captures key patterns of variance in participant responses which simpler alternative models fail to capture. These findings highlight the role of Theory of Mind in social bias detection, and broaden our understanding of the human capacity to detect and reason about implicit prejudices."

Building on the previous unpublished work by Perelman and colleagues (2010), we conducted four new studies on the SGI. A slightly modified version of the scale emerged as a well-fitting model for sentencing goals. It displayed good reliability across samples, internal structure validity, and discriminant and convergent validity with other measures. This work provides a strong basis of evidence for the SGI as a measure of current social attitudes toward criminal justice sanctions and punishment that can be used in future research and to inform public policy."

Participants were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Changes over time were analyzed using linear mixed models, considering treatment group, measurement time point, and group-by-time interactions as fixed effects. Effect sizes were computed (Cohen's d; number needed to treat; reliable change index). Participants in the avatar-based intervention showed a significant improvement in every primary and secondary outcome, while control group measurements did not change over time. The differences between the baseline and posttreatment and follow-up levels for all variables, and the differences between the intervention and control group, were statistically and clinically significant. 100% of the intervention participants and 0% of the control participants recovered after the treatment. The avatar-based intervention showed the potential to eliminate the FOD disorder criteria in both the short- and long-term. The preliminary results of this study suggest that women with FOD might benefit from an avatar-based intervention specifically designed to target the disorder."

From the impact of armed conflict and political violence, to the neuropsychiatric consequences of neglected tropical diseases, Latin America has a unique profile of region-specific risk factors that mean it is not always well-served by neuropsychiatric practice developed in, and for, high income regions. Here, we address this problem by: i) characterising key health issues in Latin America by synthesising evidence on the neuropsychiatric characteristics of traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, dementia, functional neurological disorder, infectious disease, environmental health risks, and substance use in the region, ii) reviewing the structural challenges for neuropsychiatric health in the Latin America, both in terms of those facing the population and those facing professionals and researchers, and finally, iii) identifying priorities to advance a uniquely Latin American field of neuropsychiatry, across research, training, and care delivery, that has much to gain for people in the region and much to offer the world."

An international sample of pet owners (N=443) rated the typicality of different human and pet touch behaviors. They then provided bodily contact maps for typical behaviors and reported the behaviors’ duration, probability across different situations, and associated affect. Human-pet touch was characterized by a range of tactile behaviors but strongly emphasized stroking by owners and leaning by pets. Touching took substantial time (~20-30 min/day) and was most likely when owners were resting, after separation, and during joint activities with the pet. It entailed very intimate bodily contact that was followed by positive affect. Although the different touch behaviors differentiated in their properties, overall owner and pet touching were similar and reciprocal. Together, our data identify parallels between interpersonal and human-pet touch and establish human-pet interactions as an important source for affectionate touch experiences."

Participants recalled and reflected on a fear-related or anger-related event from either a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective. Next, they completed a task that is commonly used to measure affective decision-making under uncertainty, the Iowa Gambling Task. The results in both experiments indicated that self-immersed angry (vs. fearful) decision-makers were significantly slower to avoid the risky, disadvantageous decks. These findings demonstrate how the ways in which we process negative emotional events shape their carryover effects in decision-making under uncertainty and point to self-distancing as a potential tool to control incidental emotional influences."

Neal","The purpose of these studies was to develop a novel measurement, the Sentencing Goals Inventory (SGI), for understanding the underlying people’s motivations for punishing justice-involved individuals. Prior scales have focused on punishment motives such as utilitarianism (incapacitation or deterrence) and retribution (“just deserts”) but have not assessed a rehabilitation motive (punishment with the goal of addressing the cause of criminality) in tandem. Building on the previous unpublished work by Perelman and colleagues (2010), we conducted four new studies on the SGI. A slightly modified version of the scale emerged as a well-fitting model for sentencing goals. It displayed good reliability across samples, internal structure validity, and discriminant and convergent validity with other measures. This work provides a strong basis of evidence for the SGI as a measure of current social attitudes toward criminal justice sanctions and punishment that can be used in future research and to inform public policy."

Yet, intuitively, people can often recognize when they are the subject of a bias, even in the absence of any overt behavior. How do we do this? While much research has focused on the negative consequences of being the subject of a bias, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms that allow people to explicitly detect biases in the first place. In this paper, we propose an account of bias detection which is grounded on mental state representations. We propose that people infer biases by detecting a gap between expected unbiased behavior and observed real-world behavior, which in turns reveals the hidden biases influencing other people's beliefs. We present a formal computational model of this account and, across three preregistered studies (n=720 total), we show that this model captures participants' inferences about an observer's prior beliefs (Experiment 1), general social biases (Experiment 2), and specific real-world biases (Experiments 3a--3c). Moreover, our model captures key patterns of variance in participant responses which simpler alternative models fail to capture. These findings highlight the role of Theory of Mind in social bias detection, and broaden our understanding of the human capacity to detect and reason about implicit prejudices."

Horstmann","Objective: Theories about within-person (WP) variation are often tested using between- person (BP) research, despite the well-established fact that results may not generalize across levels of analysis. One possible explanation are vague theories that do not specify which level of analysis is of interest. We illustrate such a case using the construct of self-compassion. The factor structure at the BP level has been highly debated, although the theory is actually concerned with relationships at the WP level. Method: Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was applied to experience-sampling data of self-compassion (N = 213, with n = 4,052 measurement occasions). Results: At both levels of analysis, evidence for a two-factor model was found. However, the factors were moderately related at the WP level (r = .37, p &lt; .001) but largely independent at the BP level (r = .04, p = .696). Exploratory analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity in the WP relationship among individuals. Conclusion: We discuss how our results provide new impulses to move the debate around self-compassion forward. Lastly, we outline how the WP level – which is of major interest for self- compassion and other constructs in psychology – can guide the conceptualization and assessment to promote advancements of the theory and resulting applications."

However, unlike European Americans, Latin Americans may utilize the self's positive uniqueness to form mutually supportive social relations. That is, self-enhancement is in service of maintaining interdependent social relations in Latin America. Here, we found support for this analysis. Like European Americans, Latin Americans in Mexico and Colombia judged the self to be more positive and important. However, unlike European Americans, this positive orientation extended to close others. Moreover, although Latin Americans were self-enhancing, they were so less than European Americans.

We fitted several alternative cognitive models to a series of participants’ judgements of automation reliability observed in a maritime classification task in which participants were provided with automated advice. We examined three experiments including eight between-subjects conditions and 240 participants in total. Our results favoured a two-kernel delta-rule model of learning, which specifies that humans learn by prediction error, and respond according to a learning rate that is sensitive to environmental volatility. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in learning processes across participants. These outcomes speak to the learning processes underlying how humans estimate automation reliability, and thus have implications for practice."

Do explanations regarding the source of existing inequalities influence how children and adults allocate new resources? When 3-6-year-old children (N=201) learned that inequalities were caused by structural forces (stable external constraints affecting access to resources) as opposed to internal forces (effort), they rectified inequalities, overriding previously-documented tendencies to perpetuate inequality or divide resources equally. Adults (N=201) were more likely than children to rectify inequality spontaneously; this was further strengthened by a structural explanation but reversed by an effort-based explanation. Allocation behaviors were mirrored in judgments of which allocation choices by others were appropriate. These findings reveal how explanations powerfully guide social reasoning and action from childhood through adulthood."

Yet, mindset history is an area of study where little peer-reviewed research exists, and the small amount of research that is available, is typically partial and incomplete, and sometimes contains inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims. This paper aims to address this gap by being the first peer-reviewed study to inquire into the origins, history, and lineage of mindset, to gain a broad understanding of some of the various mindset psychologies that have been developed over time and across generations, as well as to gain a sense of the collective wisdom that is present in the field as a whole. This review found that mindset psychology has a diverse, century-long history of explicit research and practice, with its origin phase taking place between 1908 and 1939, early inquiries occurring between 1940 and 1987, and contemporary bodies of work emerging in, and beyond 1988. This review also identifies some of the traditions of research and practice that are closely related to the origins and history of mindset psychology, some of which span back hundreds and thousands of years. The paper concludes with a reflection on my lived experience as a mindset practitioner and the journey of transformation I moved through to embrace a more holistic and intergenerational understanding. You are invited to become part of the future of mindset psychology by deepening your understanding of its history, and by grounding your work in a comprehensive understanding of the entire field."

Although neuroimaging techniques are starting to uncover functional changes within the brain linked to acute exercise, the exact physiological mechanisms of how exercise stimulates the brain and boosts cognitive function remain unclear.  Exercise can challenge the body's natural homeostatic state. To adapt to this, multiple integrated, and even redundant, physiological reactions are triggered in various systems and organs throughout the body, including the brain. This raises the question of which exercise-related neurobiological systems in the brain are involved in elevating cognitive performance and what the original trigger of this is. In a recent paper, Ando et al. (2024) aimed to investigate these questions from the perspective of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and electrical muscle stimulation. Here we build on those results by exploring the roles of dopamine, central command, and exercise pressor reflex."

Symmetry bifactor analysis yielded insufficient support for a p-factor, therefore, further analyses were explored and an S-1-bifactor analysis achieved the best model fit. In a structural equation model, the S-1-bifactor model yielded evidence that future self-valence and self-connectedness both negatively correlated with internalising symptoms, ADHD symptoms, psychosis-like symptoms, and substance use. These findings supported transdiagnostic processes and potential intervention strategies of these future-oriented dimensions."

Acceptance and rejection relate to changes in positive and negative affect, although directionality of the relation remains unclear. The ability to regulate affect following social experiences may be part of the etiology of social anxiety disorder. With the importance of social cues in adolescence, as well as adolescence as a key window for the onset of social anxiety, we used daily diary data collected in a sample ranging from 9-18 years to examine daily changes in acceptance, rejection, positive affect, and negative affect. Taking a person-centered approach, we constructed networks directionally linking social experiences and affect, which served as behaviors of interest (“nodes”) in the network, for each individual. From these networks, we extracted recovery times from different nodes, i.e., the number of days it took for a node to return to baseline when 1) the node itself was perturbed and 2) when a connected node was perturbed. We examined associations between network metrics and social anxiety, age, gender, and their interaction. We found that the recovery time of positive affect when social acceptance was perturbed was inversely related with social anxiety and age, suggesting benefits of acceptance may be shorter-lasting for those with more (vs. less) social anxiety symptoms and for older (vs. younger) adolescents. We conclude that positive affect may be a critical yet understudied piece in understanding why adolescence is a developmental period of increased risk for psychopathology and for understanding the etiology of social anxiety disorder."

Going beyond existing research on common survey biases, we introduce an information sampling bias that can explain all three problems. In judgment and decision research, asymmetric sampling occurs when an individual can only gather a sample of information about a target object (e.g., environment, person) from his or her own experience. It follows that any personal sample is limited by the environment and, given behavioral baselines, is selective for certain experiences (e.g., based on positive affect or habits). We apply the sampling framework to personality assessment and show that, independent of motivational constraints, selective sampling alone invokes an asymmetric mental model of one's own (but also others') personality (e.g., extraversion) in which certain situations are over- or under-represented. We call this asymmetric sampling of personality (ASP). Asymmetric samples of experienced situations lack the generalizability to reliably predict behavior (as a tendency to behave consistently across situations). Moreover, differently biased situation samples can explain self-observer discrepancies in personality ratings as well as multiple observer divergences, calling for a revision of quality standards for inter-rater reliability. Understanding ASP provides a methodological solution to these three problems: it assists all respondents (i.e., self- and peer-observers) in symmetrically sampling situations that generally make it easy or difficult to express a particular personality trait. We discuss ASP in assessment contexts, as well as procedural extensions of the sampling framework, and suggest specific study paradigms for quantifying individual bias due to ASP."

Seed region and independent component analyses are currently the dominant connectivity measures but carry the risk of false negatives due to selection. They can be complemented by data-driven whole-brain metrics of intrinsic brain activity (IBA). We meta-analytically integrated voxel-wise IBA measures of regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), voxel-mirrored homotopy connectivity (VMHC) and degree centrality (DC) across different SUDs using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm, functionally decoded emerging clusters, and analysed their connectivity profiles. Our systematic search identified 51 studies including 1,439 SUD participants. Although no overall convergent pattern of alterations across IBA measures in SUDs was found, sensitivity analyses demonstrated two ALE-derived clusters of increased ReHo and ALFF in SUDs, which peaked in the left pre- and postcentral cortices. Subsequent analyses showed their involvement in action execution, somesthesis, finger tapping and vibrotactile monitoring/discrimination. Their numerous clinical correlates across included studies highlight the under-discussed role of sensorimotor cortices in SUD, urging a more attentive exploration of their clinical significance."

Findings include significant differences in the use of first-person pronouns, suggesting an intensified focus on self. Broader psycholinguistic variables, such as negative emotions and male references, did not show significant differences. A discussion of the results and implications for future research and practice are included."

Although neuroimaging techniques are starting to uncover functional changes within the brain linked to acute exercise, the exact physiological mechanisms of how exercise stimulates the brain and boosts cognitive function remain unclear.  Exercise can challenge the body's natural homeostatic state. To adapt to this, multiple integrated, and even redundant, physiological reactions are triggered in various systems and organs throughout the body, including the brain. This raises the question of which exercise-related neurobiological systems in the brain are involved in elevating cognitive performance and what the original trigger of this is. In a recent paper, Ando et al. (2024) aimed to investigate these questions from the perspective of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and electrical muscle stimulation. Here we build on those results by exploring the roles of dopamine, central command, and exercise pressor reflex."

The current study aimed to highlight differences in Reddit blog posts and the top five bestselling books on the perinatal period. A keyword analysis was used to compare the corpuses. The three words with the strongest keyness in the literature were baby’s, women, practitioner, labor, and study. The words with the strongest keyness on social media were husband, people, weeks, love, and feel. To date, no studies have been conducted about words most associated with the term “depression” in the perinatal period; thus, this study aimed to find words most associated with the word stem depress*.

Seed region and independent component analyses are currently the dominant connectivity measures but carry the risk of false negatives due to selection. They can be complemented by data-driven whole-brain metrics of intrinsic brain activity (IBA). We meta-analytically integrated voxel-wise IBA measures of regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), voxel-mirrored homotopy connectivity (VMHC) and degree centrality (DC) across different SUDs using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm, functionally decoded emerging clusters, and analysed their connectivity profiles. Our systematic search identified 51 studies including 1,439 SUD participants. Although no overall convergent pattern of alterations across IBA measures in SUDs was found, sensitivity analyses demonstrated two ALE-derived clusters of increased ReHo and ALFF in SUDs, which peaked in the left pre- and postcentral cortices. Subsequent analyses showed their involvement in action execution, somesthesis, finger tapping and vibrotactile monitoring/discrimination. Their numerous clinical correlates across included studies highlight the under-discussed role of sensorimotor cortices in SUD, urging a more attentive exploration of their clinical significance."

Going beyond existing research on common survey biases, we introduce an information sampling bias that can explain all three problems. In judgment and decision research, asymmetric sampling occurs when an individual can only gather a sample of information about a target object (e.g., environment, person) from his or her own experience. It follows that any personal sample is limited by the environment and, given behavioral baselines, is selective for certain experiences (e.g., based on positive affect or habits). We apply the sampling framework to personality assessment and show that, independent of motivational constraints, selective sampling alone invokes an asymmetric mental model of one's own (but also others') personality (e.g., extraversion) in which certain situations are over- or under-represented. We call this asymmetric sampling of personality (ASP). Asymmetric samples of experienced situations lack the generalizability to reliably predict behavior (as a tendency to behave consistently across situations). Moreover, differently biased situation samples can explain self-observer discrepancies in personality ratings as well as multiple observer divergences, calling for a revision of quality standards for inter-rater reliability. Understanding ASP provides a methodological solution to these three problems: it assists all respondents (i.e., self- and peer-observers) in symmetrically sampling situations that generally make it easy or difficult to express a particular personality trait. We discuss ASP in assessment contexts, as well as procedural extensions of the sampling framework, and suggest specific study paradigms for quantifying individual bias due to ASP."

Acceptance and rejection relate to changes in positive and negative affect, although directionality of the relation remains unclear. The ability to regulate affect following social experiences may be part of the etiology of social anxiety disorder. With the importance of social cues in adolescence, as well as adolescence as a key window for the onset of social anxiety, we used daily diary data collected in a sample ranging from 9-18 years to examine daily changes in acceptance, rejection, positive affect, and negative affect. Taking a person-centered approach, we constructed networks directionally linking social experiences and affect, which served as behaviors of interest (“nodes”) in the network, for each individual. From these networks, we extracted recovery times from different nodes, i.e., the number of days it took for a node to return to baseline when 1) the node itself was perturbed and 2) when a connected node was perturbed. We examined associations between network metrics and social anxiety, age, gender, and their interaction. We found that the recovery time of positive affect when social acceptance was perturbed was inversely related with social anxiety and age, suggesting benefits of acceptance may be shorter-lasting for those with more (vs. less) social anxiety symptoms and for older (vs. younger) adolescents. We conclude that positive affect may be a critical yet understudied piece in understanding why adolescence is a developmental period of increased risk for psychopathology and for understanding the etiology of social anxiety disorder."

Given the tendency for mental illnesses to co-occur, there is a necessity to better understand the specific links between the dimensions of future-oriented concepts and general versus specific mental illnesses. This study used bi-factor analysis in z-proso wave 8 data (N=1180, age=20) to examine the transdiagnostic and disorder-specific associations between future self-connectedness and self-valence and mental illnesses. Symmetry bifactor analysis yielded insufficient support for a p-factor, therefore, further analyses were explored and an S-1-bifactor analysis achieved the best model fit. In a structural equation model, the S-1-bifactor model yielded evidence that future self-valence and self-connectedness both negatively correlated with internalising symptoms, ADHD symptoms, psychosis-like symptoms, and substance use. These findings supported transdiagnostic processes and potential intervention strategies of these future-oriented dimensions."

Yet, mindset history is an area of study where little peer-reviewed research exists, and the small amount of research that is available, is typically partial and incomplete, and sometimes contains inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims. This paper aims to address this gap by being the first peer-reviewed study to inquire into the origins, history, and lineage of mindset, to gain a broad understanding of some of the various mindset psychologies that have been developed over time and across generations, as well as to gain a sense of the collective wisdom that is present in the field as a whole. This review found that mindset psychology has a diverse, century-long history of explicit research and practice, with its origin phase taking place between 1908 and 1939, early inquiries occurring between 1940 and 1987, and contemporary bodies of work emerging in, and beyond 1988. This review also identifies some of the traditions of research and practice that are closely related to the origins and history of mindset psychology, some of which span back hundreds and thousands of years. The paper concludes with a reflection on my lived experience as a mindset practitioner and the journey of transformation I moved through to embrace a more holistic and intergenerational understanding. You are invited to become part of the future of mindset psychology by deepening your understanding of its history, and by grounding your work in a comprehensive understanding of the entire field."

Do explanations regarding the source of existing inequalities influence how children and adults allocate new resources? When 3-6-year-old children (N=201) learned that inequalities were caused by structural forces (stable external constraints affecting access to resources) as opposed to internal forces (effort), they rectified inequalities, overriding previously-documented tendencies to perpetuate inequality or divide resources equally. Adults (N=201) were more likely than children to rectify inequality spontaneously; this was further strengthened by a structural explanation but reversed by an effort-based explanation. Allocation behaviors were mirrored in judgments of which allocation choices by others were appropriate. These findings reveal how explanations powerfully guide social reasoning and action from childhood through adulthood."

Currently, the processes by which humans track the level of reliability of automation are unclear. In the current study, we test cognitive models of learning that could potentially explain how humans track automation reliability. We fitted several alternative cognitive models to a series of participants’ judgements of automation reliability observed in a maritime classification task in which participants were provided with automated advice. We examined three experiments including eight between-subjects conditions and 240 participants in total. Our results favoured a two-kernel delta-rule model of learning, which specifies that humans learn by prediction error, and respond according to a learning rate that is sensitive to environmental volatility. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in learning processes across participants. These outcomes speak to the learning processes underlying how humans estimate automation reliability, and thus have implications for practice."

A soft skills gap has previously been reported between employer requirements and the skills graduates offer, suggesting that educators are inadequately preparing students for their future careers. It is important to identify the links between educators and the materials they claim to teach as it offers insight into how non-technical aspects of software engineering are promoted. We report on two studies where we first explore the staff perceptions of embedded soft skills in five computer science undergraduate courses, before identifying soft skill presence in curricula across eight UK universities. A multi-site interview with educators identified core skills of critical thinking, communication, and teamwork being included in curricula for student employability. Staff believe students experience a temporal delay between being introduced to skills and actually valuing them. In the second study, we mined publicly-available course and module information, and then analysed non-technical skill references. Soft skills are commonly found in proximity to other soft skills, suggesting they are taught or assessed together. Software engineering was seen to be closely linked to teamwork and communication, emphasising it is taught as a social enterprise. Taking these two studies together, educators show a close alignment to curricula, and the skills valued by higher education institutions reflect the skills valued in software engineering industries, suggesting the skill gap is the result of student misconceptions."

Previous research suggests that people with aphantasia (aphants) may have a higher prevalence of mental health conditions and neurodivergence compared to the general population, but aphantasia presents a special challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Many mental health conditions are currently characterized by imagery-related symptomology (such as sensory flashbacks in post-traumatic stress disorder or negative body image in eating disorders), and the dominant therapeutic treatments rely heavily on imagery techniques. Thus far, little is known about how this impacts mental healthcare experiences in individuals with aphantasia. In the current study, we will use a mixed-methods (questionnaire, interview) approach to comprehensively investigate the effects of aphantasia on seeking diagnoses and treatments for mental illness. Quantitative analyses on the questionnaire data revealed that virtually all psychiatric disorders manifest with a lack of imagery-related symptomology in aphantasia compared to typical imagery controls; aphants report “lack of awareness or understanding of aphantasia” as a common factor in missed- or misdiagnosis by mental health professionals, although the prevalence of missed and misdiagnoses are no different from typical imagery controls; and aphants are very likely to report that therapies involving mental imagery, especially visual imagery in CBT, are ineffective in their mental health treatment compared to controls. A detailed summary of the quantitative results follows."

Gendered Evaluations of Racialized Names",To be fetched,"Names are frequently used in social science research to manipulate identities such as race and gender. However, names may signal unintended identities or downplay intended identities. Three studies (N = 1,100 US participants) examined the gendered evaluations of names from five racial groups: Chinese, Indian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Studies 1 and 2 consistently found that Chinese and Indian female names were perceived as less feminine and more masculine than the three other racialized female names, which contradicts extant findings using Asian female faces. Chinese and Indian male names, on the other hand, were considered more feminine and less masculine than the other racialized male names. Study 3 found that participants expressed greater uncertainty and lower confidence about the gender of Chinese and Indian names compared to other racialized names. This research raises potential methodological concerns regarding the effectiveness of racialized names in signaling the gender of Asian ethnic groups."

Traditionally, IPV is conceptualized through a gendered lens, with men as the perpetrators and women as the victims. The current study explored the association between perpetrator/victim sex, prosecutor gender role attitudes, and prosecutorial decision-making in a case of alleged IPV. We hypothesized prosecutors with more traditional gender role attitudes would be more lenient, and this effect to be exacerbated in cases involving a female perpetrator. Criminal prosecutors across the U.S. (N = 94) completed the Male Role Norms Inventory- Revised and read case materials describing the alleged IPV between a heterosexual couple (e.g., arrest report, medical records). The victim/perpetrator sex was manipulated to involve either a female- (male victim) or male- (female victim) perpetrated IPV case. Results indicate gender role attitudes were not associated with prosecutorial decision-making. However, prosecutors perceived the violence as more serious and the perpetrator as more likely to reoffend when the perpetrator was male; further, they attributed more blame to the female victim. An interaction between perpetrator sex and prosecutor gender role attitudes indicates those with more traditional beliefs were more likely to blame the female (rather than male) victim. These data suggest extralegal factors related to the perpetrator (i.e., perpetrator sex), rather than prosecutor individual differences (i.e., gender role attitudes), are associated with prosecutor discretionary decision-making. In tandem with real-world disparities in the prosecution of IPV based on perpetrator sex, the current research stresses the importance of exploring a diversity of factors that account for these observed differences."

To map this diverse terrain, we offer an analytical heuristic—a continuum of approaches to digital disconnection. This tool proposes one primary dimension – viewing digital disconnection as individually functional to socially meaningful (ontology) – and two secondary, concomitant dimensions – holding post-positive to interpretivist perspectives on knowledge generation (epistemology) as well as applying quantitative to qualitative methods (methodology). We offer examples of scholarship along the continuum and advocate for the complementarity of different approaches. Although the continuum is not a universal framework, it provides a tool for scholars to review the domain and for digital disconnection researchers specifically to locate themselves on and build bridges across the continuum. We hope that this continuum supports and expands the pluralistic nature of digital disconnection scholarship into the future."

Both generating predictions and retrieval practice are active learning approaches that involve generating responses and then being provided with the correct information or retrieving previously provided correct information. Participants included 90 children (mean age: 7 years; Female = 46, Male = 42). Parents reported children’s race and ethnicity as follows: 2% Asian/Pacific Islander, 5% African American, 74% Caucasian, 3% other, and 6% identified as two or more categories; demographics largely reflective of the county where the data was collected, but nevertheless the generalizability of these findings to more diverse populations may be limited. In this study, young children learned facts about insects (e.g., “insects are hard on the outside”) while we measured their attention to the lesson using eye tracking technology. Then their knowledge was assessed on an immediate test. All children were presented with the same materials but the presentation order was modified based on condition assignment. In the generating predictions condition, children saw examples of animals and were asked if an animal was an insect or they saw animals and were asked to identify which one was the insect, followed by the correct response. In the retrieve condition, the presentation order was reversed such that children first saw the correct response and then were asked if the animal was an insect or which of two examples was an insect. Results suggest that although retrieval practice results in overall better learning outcomes, generating predictions increased children's attention to the materials (d = 1.92), and among children who were able to maintain attention, learning outcomes were equal among the two conditions."

Here, we present data from &gt; 6,500 subjects from 5-72 years of age, freely viewing 40 natural scenes. We find that the development of scene viewing is surprisingly protracted. Semantic salience for social features continuously changes until late adolescence and text salience increases until the third decade of life. Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until early adulthood, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence. These findings show that fundamental aspects of adult gaze take decades of continuous development and push individuals towards more canonical viewing patterns. We suggest that development is key to understanding the general mechanisms of active vision."

Thus, we investigate how identical medical advice is evaluated, depending on whether AI was believed to be involved in advice generation.  Methods We conducted a preregistered, online experiment with a large, heterogenous sample (N = 1,050 adults from 60 nationalities). Participants were presented with fictious scenarios of patients receiving medical advice. All participants received identical information, but we manipulated whether this advice was labeled as either generated by AI, by a human physician or by a combination of both. Participants assessed the provided content regarding perceived reliability, empathy and comprehensibility.  Results AI-labelled medical advice was evaluated as significantly less reliable (p &lt; .001, d = 0.28), and  less empathetic (p &lt; .001, d = 0.27) but not as less comprehensible (p = .824, d = 0.02) compared to human-labelled advice.

Exploratory analyses further indicate that for perceived reliability these effects were particularly pronounced in urgent medical situations (acute symptoms vs. general advice seeking).  Conclusions Our findings point toward an anti-AI bias within healthcare, even when AI is supervised by a human physician. Given the tremendous potential of AI for medicine, elucidating ways to counteract this bias should be a major goal of future research."

Observational datasets provide a rich resource for exploring these types of questions; however, the lack of randomisation to treatments in these data means they are vulnerable to confounding issues. Counterfactual analysis refers to a family of techniques within the potential outcomes framework that can help address confounding. In doing so, they can help differentiate potential intervention targets that may reflect genuine active ingredients in mental health from those that are only associated with mental health outcomes due to their common dependence on ‘third variables’. However, counterfactual analysis is rarely used for this purpose and where it is used in health research it is often implemented in a suboptimal fashion. One key reason may be a lack of accessible tutorials and software that embeds best practices.  Method: To help promote the principled use of counterfactual analysis we developed DigiCAT. DigiCAT is an open digital tool built in R and Shiny that implements a range of counterfactual analysis methods. It is accompanied by accessible tutorials. The tool has been designed to handle real data, with capabilities for missing data, non-binary treatment effects, and complex survey designs. Results: The current article describes the development of DigiCAT, drawing on user and lived experience expert input and provides an overview of its features and examples of its uses. Conclusions: Counterfactual analysis could help prioritise intervention targets by establishing which ones remain associated with mental health outcomes after accounting for potential confounding. Accessible digital tools supported by clear guidance may help promote the uptake and principled use of these techniques."

Parry","The study of digital disconnection – the voluntary non-use of digital media – is a growing research domain characterized by increasingly pluralistic approaches. To map this diverse terrain, we offer an analytical heuristic—a continuum of approaches to digital disconnection. This tool proposes one primary dimension – viewing digital disconnection as individually functional to socially meaningful (ontology) – and two secondary, concomitant dimensions – holding post-positive to interpretivist perspectives on knowledge generation (epistemology) as well as applying quantitative to qualitative methods (methodology). We offer examples of scholarship along the continuum and advocate for the complementarity of different approaches. Although the continuum is not a universal framework, it provides a tool for scholars to review the domain and for digital disconnection researchers specifically to locate themselves on and build bridges across the continuum. We hope that this continuum supports and expands the pluralistic nature of digital disconnection scholarship into the future."

The integrity of this process can be compromised by sophisticated fraud attacks using digitally manipulated face images. In this study, we examine whether the super-recogniser (SR) advantage for face identity processing extends to the detection of digitally manipulated passport photos. Using two face manipulation detection tasks (DFMD1, DFMD2), SRs and typical-recogniser controls were asked to decide whether a suspicious passport photo had been digitally manipulated. The findings show that the super-recogniser advantage does appear to generalise to the detection of digitally manipulated face images. The applied implications of these findings are discussed."

Goh,"Names are frequently used in social science research to manipulate identities such as race and gender. However, names may signal unintended identities or downplay intended identities. Three studies (N = 1,100 US participants) examined the gendered evaluations of names from five racial groups: Chinese, Indian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Studies 1 and 2 consistently found that Chinese and Indian female names were perceived as less feminine and more masculine than the three other racialized female names, which contradicts extant findings using Asian female faces. Chinese and Indian male names, on the other hand, were considered more feminine and less masculine than the other racialized male names. Study 3 found that participants expressed greater uncertainty and lower confidence about the gender of Chinese and Indian names compared to other racialized names. This research raises potential methodological concerns regarding the effectiveness of racialized names in signaling the gender of Asian ethnic groups."

Observational datasets provide a rich resource for exploring these types of questions; however, the lack of randomisation to treatments in these data means they are vulnerable to confounding issues. Counterfactual analysis refers to a family of techniques within the potential outcomes framework that can help address confounding. In doing so, they can help differentiate potential intervention targets that may reflect genuine active ingredients in mental health from those that are only associated with mental health outcomes due to their common dependence on ‘third variables’. However, counterfactual analysis is rarely used for this purpose and where it is used in health research it is often implemented in a suboptimal fashion. One key reason may be a lack of accessible tutorials and software that embeds best practices.  Method: To help promote the principled use of counterfactual analysis we developed DigiCAT. DigiCAT is an open digital tool built in R and Shiny that implements a range of counterfactual analysis methods. It is accompanied by accessible tutorials. The tool has been designed to handle real data, with capabilities for missing data, non-binary treatment effects, and complex survey designs. Results: The current article describes the development of DigiCAT, drawing on user and lived experience expert input and provides an overview of its features and examples of its uses. Conclusions: Counterfactual analysis could help prioritise intervention targets by establishing which ones remain associated with mental health outcomes after accounting for potential confounding. Accessible digital tools supported by clear guidance may help promote the uptake and principled use of these techniques."

Previous research suggests that people with aphantasia (aphants) may have a higher prevalence of mental health conditions and neurodivergence compared to the general population, but aphantasia presents a special challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Many mental health conditions are currently characterized by imagery-related symptomology (such as sensory flashbacks in post-traumatic stress disorder or negative body image in eating disorders), and the dominant therapeutic treatments rely heavily on imagery techniques. Thus far, little is known about how this impacts mental healthcare experiences in individuals with aphantasia. In the current study, we will use a mixed-methods (questionnaire, interview) approach to comprehensively investigate the effects of aphantasia on seeking diagnoses and treatments for mental illness. Quantitative analyses on the questionnaire data revealed that virtually all psychiatric disorders manifest with a lack of imagery-related symptomology in aphantasia compared to typical imagery controls; aphants report “lack of awareness or understanding of aphantasia” as a common factor in missed- or misdiagnosis by mental health professionals, although the prevalence of missed and misdiagnoses are no different from typical imagery controls; and aphants are very likely to report that therapies involving mental imagery, especially visual imagery in CBT, are ineffective in their mental health treatment compared to controls. A detailed summary of the quantitative results follows."

A soft skills gap has previously been reported between employer requirements and the skills graduates offer, suggesting that educators are inadequately preparing students for their future careers. It is important to identify the links between educators and the materials they claim to teach as it offers insight into how non-technical aspects of software engineering are promoted. We report on two studies where we first explore the staff perceptions of embedded soft skills in five computer science undergraduate courses, before identifying soft skill presence in curricula across eight UK universities. A multi-site interview with educators identified core skills of critical thinking, communication, and teamwork being included in curricula for student employability. Staff believe students experience a temporal delay between being introduced to skills and actually valuing them. In the second study, we mined publicly-available course and module information, and then analysed non-technical skill references. Soft skills are commonly found in proximity to other soft skills, suggesting they are taught or assessed together. Software engineering was seen to be closely linked to teamwork and communication, emphasising it is taught as a social enterprise. Taking these two studies together, educators show a close alignment to curricula, and the skills valued by higher education institutions reflect the skills valued in software engineering industries, suggesting the skill gap is the result of student misconceptions."

Our study seeks to overcome these challenges by employing dynamic systems theory, the mathematical study of complex systems, their behavior over time, and their responses to external stimuli. We apply this approach to a dataset containing over 400,000 texts from more than 1,600 individuals, with half reporting a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), collected from X (previously Twitter). We examined the emotional experiences and significant life events described in these texts across a one-month period, that we extracted using state-of-the-art natural language processing. Our analysis then aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how emotions evolve, how they interact, and how, if at all, they are altered by depression. The key result of our research is the discovery of emotion-specific dynamics – the unique ways in which different emotions maintain their influence over time. In individuals diagnosed with MDD, we observed a ’blunting’ of the inter-emotional dynamics; this is not merely a dulling of emotions, but rather a vanishing of the boundaries between them. Our findings thus challenge and unify traditional views in this area: when viewed in isolation, this blending of emotions could be misinterpreted as both augmented emotion and blunted emotions but also as Emotional Context Insensitivity (ECI). Our study therefore offers a principles mathematical understanding of emotion dynamics and their alterations within mental disorders, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic interventions."

Mothers (N=40) and fathers (N=48) played “Cyberball” ostensibly with their own and an unrelated child, who consecutively included, excluded, and re-included parents. We found that overall, exclusion yielded comparable neural activation in mothers and fathers associated with mentalizing, saliency, and emotion-processing. We also observed a parent gender effect in several brain areas: While mothers exhibited increased reward- and attention-related activity during inclusion, fathers displayed increased mentalizing-related activity during exclusion. Additionally, we tested parents’ response to re-inclusion, which revealed a selective decrease in reward-related activity. There were no differences in parental brain activity as a function of child identity (own vs. unrelated). This study elucidates the common and distinct means by which mothers and fathers engage with their children, especially during play, lending support for theories postulating partial differentiation of paternal and maternal parenting systems."

Despite numerous correlational studies, robust evidence on the causal relationship between videogames and cognition remains scarce, hindered by the absence of a comprehensive assessment tool for gaming skills across various genres. This study aimed to develop and validate the Gaming Skill Questionnaire (GSQ) and to assess the impact of gaming skills in six different genres (Sports, First-Person Shooters, Role-Playing Games, Action-Adventure, Strategy, and Puzzle Games) on adolescents’ cognitive and affective abilities. The GSQ exhibited strong reliability and validity, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool. Gaming skills positively affected executive function, memory, overall cognition, cognitive flexibility, and emotion recognition, except for empathy. Various game genres had different effects on cognitive and affective abilities, with verbal fluency influenced mainly by sports, executive functions by action, strategy, and puzzle, and emotion recognition positively impacted by action and puzzle but negatively by sports and strategy games. Both age and gaming skills influenced cognitive flexibility, with gaming having a greater effect. These intriguing genre-specific effects on cognitive and affective functioning postulate further research with GSQ's contribution."

Series of objects undergoing either human or robotic grasping actions together with static (no action) objects were presented, while participants indicated their preference for each object. After a short delay, their memory for grasped, static and new (unstudied) stimuli was tested. Human actions enhanced preference and subsequent recollection of objects, more than robotic actions. In the context of human action, static objects were also perceived as more familiar at recognition. The goal contagion's influence on memory was found to be independent from its impact on preference.

In individuals diagnosed with MDD, we observed a ’blunting’ of the inter-emotional dynamics; this is not merely a dulling of emotions, but rather a vanishing of the boundaries between them. Our findings thus challenge and unify traditional views in this area: when viewed in isolation, this blending of emotions could be misinterpreted as both augmented emotion and blunted emotions but also as Emotional Context Insensitivity (ECI). Our study therefore offers a principles mathematical understanding of emotion dynamics and their alterations within mental disorders, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic interventions."

Thus, the time-series patterns of multiple behaviors between two people reveal the characteristics of the interaction. In this study, we conducted an experiment on travel consultations between clerks and customers, which was as close as possible to a real situation, and analyzed the time-series shifts of multiple behaviors in a 30-minute dyadic interaction using a hidden Markov model. We found differences in interactions between successful and unsuccessful consultations. In particular, in the successful interaction, a customer became interested in the content of the consultation in the first 10 minutes, and such a state was likely to persist during the consultation. This finding provides new insights into the characteristics of people’s evaluation of an event that lasts for a certain amount of time, which is often determined in the early stages of the event."

Poverty has been found to diminish cognitive ability and cause the poor to forego beneficial programs. In the present study, we examined how exacerbating the psychological burden of poverty through an intervention that asked participants to recall a negative personal experience that made them feel unsuccessful influences the rate of acceptance of mixed gambles. Mixed gambles yield both gains and losses and simulate choices in life that contain both a risk of loss and an opportunity for gain. A second group of participants was asked to recall a positive personal experience that made them feel successful or proud, while a third group was not assigned any recall task. Experiment 1 targeted the intervention to a group of people living in extreme poverty in Kenya. Experiment 2 replicated the study in a group of non-poor students in Italy. Experiment 3 replicated the study online with a heterogeneous sample of people living in the UK. Results showed that recalling a negative life experience significantly reduced the average expected value of the accepted gambles. Recalling a positive life experience also significantly reduced the average expected value of accepted bets, although to a lesser extent. However, the treatments only affected poor individuals (Experiment 1), whereas non-poor individuals (Experiments 2 and 3) were immune to this effect. In addition, neither education nor cognitive ability was found to mediate the effect. These findings show that the burden of poverty can increase loss aversion, discouraging the poor from accepting risky investments with a positive expected value that could help them escape poverty in the long run, such as investments in personal education, small businesses, or retirement plans."

However, the specific patterns of such movements have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we studied how movement behavior is influenced by scene complexity, varied in terms of reverberation and the number of concurrent talkers. Thirteen normal-hearing participants engaged in a speech comprehension and localization task, requiring them to indicate the spatial location of a spoken story in the presence of other stories in virtual audio-visual scenes. We observed delayed initial head movements when more simultaneous talkers were present in the scene. Both reverberation and a higher number of talkers extended the search period, increased the number of fixated source locations, and resulted in more gaze jumps. The period preceding the participants’ responses was prolonged when more concurrent talkers were present, and listeners continued to move their eyes in the proximity of the target talker. In scenes with more reverberation, the final head position when making the decision was farther away from the target. These findings demonstrate that the complexity of the acoustic scene influences listener behavior during speech comprehension and localization in audio-visual scenes."

However, strategy use may also explain individual differences in WM. Here we explored the degree to which individuals use the optimal encoding strategy in visual WM. Participants searched for a target that changed between two alternating displays that cycled until response. Critically, participants were free to choose between two available targets (one red, one blue), and the ratio of red to blue items varied randomly across trials. Therefore, the optimal strategy was to selectively encode items in the smaller colour subset. Our main findings (Experiment 1 and a larger-sample replication in Experiment 5) showed a general tendency to choose the optimal (small subset) target, but there were large individual differences in strategy choice, with many participants using sub-optimal strategies. Further, we found some evidence that WM ability predicts strategy use. Experiment 2 showed that strategy use was not stable over time. Many participants spontaneously shifted to highly-optimal target choices, suggesting a sudden discovery of the optimal strategy. Experiment 3 confirmed the importance of explicit knowledge in strategy choice. Informing participants about the optimal strategy induced a large strategy improvement. Moreover, optimally-performing participants demonstrated explicit awareness of the optimal strategy. Experiment 4 showed that, even under greater task demands, when participants viewed the displays only once, strategy use was still sub-optimal. Our findings highlight strategy choice as an important source of individual variation, and therefore should be considered alongside ability to fully understand differences in WM performance."

https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxbtc,2024-02-13,Do Different Features of Interdependence Have the Same Psychological Consequences? Familial Respect Predicts Dispositional Bias,To be fetched,"People from interdependent cultures are thought to show a weaker dispositional bias because they are more attuned to situational factors, such as norms and roles. However, do interdependent psychological tendencies always predict this pattern in attributions? Another aspect related to interdependence is a focus on maintaining positive family and social relations. The importance of maintaining close family relationships, known as familial obligation, may promote dispositional attributions for positive behaviors. Using an EEG measure of dispositional bias with Latinx college students (N = 41), we found that familial respect predicted a stronger dispositional bias, while interdependent self-construal predicted a weaker one (Study 1). In Study 2, we replicated the pattern in a pre-registered cross-cultural comparison between Mexicans and European Americans (N = 802): familial respect predicted a tendency to form internal attributions, while interdependent self-construal predicted a tendency to form situational attributions. To examine the mechanism for the effect we examined the role of the valence of the situation (Studies 2-3) and the Latinx cultural value of simpatía (a tendency to be warm and positive) in a sample of Mexicans (N = 393; Study 3). Familial respect predicted internal attributions for positive situations only (Studies 2-3), which was in part explained by simpatía (Study 3). We propose that different features of interdependence, such as familial obligation, need to be examined separately to understand cultural variation in psychology."

While several psychology and neuroscience studies have explored the factors that influence dishonesty, research on how incidental emotions affect moral decision-making remains limited. Influential models linking emotion and ethics, suggest that inducing specific emotions may bias individuals to become self-focused, and thus elicit self-serving deception, or other-focused and thus lead to truth-telling or prosocial lies. To expand on the knowledge inspired by these models, here we investigated how incidental anger, gratitude, and happiness influence dishonest behaviour. Using an ecologically-valid deception task, the Temptation to Lie Card Game, we found that egoistic lies were associated more to incidental anger and happiness than to gratitude. Moreover, levels of personality traits relevant for deceptive behaviours significantly correlated with a higher rate of egoistic lies for anger and happiness, but not gratitude induction. These findings align with recent models suggesting that the impact of emotions on moral decision-making is influenced by cognitive appraisal mechanisms, which affect how people evaluate future events, prioritizing themselves or others. Our study represents the first to compare the effects of multiple incidental emotions on deception and may serve as a foundation for exploring the link between emotions and moral-decision making at behavioural and neural levels."

This study sought to validate the ‘Psychedelic Predictor Scale’ (PPS), a short, widely applicable, prospective measure intended to be predictive of salient dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Using four independent datasets in which the PPS was completed prospectively – two online surveys of ‘naturalistic’ use (N = 741, N = 836) and two controlled administration datasets (N = 30, N = 28) – we conducted factor analysis, regression, and correlation analyses to assess the construct, predictive, and convergent validity of the PPS. Our approach produced a 9-item scale with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.8) containing three factors: set, rapport, and intention. The PPS was significantly predictive of ‘mystical’, ‘challenging’, and ‘emotional breakthrough’ experiences. In a controlled administration dataset (N = 28), multiple regression found set and rapport explaining 40% of variance in mystical experience, and simple regression found set explained 16% of variance in challenging experience. In another (N = 30), rapport was related to emotional breakthrough explaining 9% of the variance. Together, these data suggest that the PPS is predictive of relevant acute features of the psychedelic experience in a broad range of contexts. We hope that this brief 9-item scale will be widely adopted for improved safety of psychedelic experiences in controlled settings and beyond."

This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) and includes 90 healthy older adults (65-84 years) that were randomised to an 18-month meditation training or a non-native language (English) training. Responsiveness was measured post-intervention using participants’ and teachers’ ratings of four psychological domains (connection, positive/negative emotions, meta-awareness) in relation to two contexts (during sessions, in daily life), teachers’ perception of overall benefit, and a global composite comprising all self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness measures. Linear regression modelling indicates that, when including baseline variables (sex, education, neuroticism, cognition, expectancy) and engagement (hours of formal practice during intervention), only higher levels of engagement were associated with higher global composite scores (standardised estimate=0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p&lt;0.001). Global composite scores were not correlated with pre-post changes in well-being. Findings indicate that more time spent practising meditation was related to greater perceived intervention effects.

Methods. Based on a mixed-methods design, we conducted an online survey (N=538, 54.83% of women), three focus groups (n=9, 3 women), and eight individual interviews (5 women). The survey assessed the percentage of active mobility during a typical week, and examined mobility-related (e.g., main travel motive, density of residence), sociodemographic (gender, number of children under 12 years), and individual (intention towards active mobility, green identity) levers and obstacles to active and sustainable mobility using multiple linear regressions. Interviews and focus groups were carried with experts in mobility and car drivers intending to reduce their car use and living in Grenoble Metropolitan Area (France) to further understand levers and obstacles specific to this area. Qualitative data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Results. The quantitative study highlighted that mobility-related (having a transport pass, doing trips for leisure or volunteer activities), sociodemographic (having children of 12 years and older), and individual ones (attitudes towards the car, active mobility habits, perceived physical health) were independently associated to active and sustainable mobility. So far, no significant interactions between these factors were observed. The qualitative study highlighted some Grenoble metropolitan area’s specific mobility-related factors such as the fact of living in the mountains as being an obstacle to active and sustainable mobility. Conclusions. Active and sustainable mobility was related to individual, sociodemographic and mobility-related levers and obstacles. The results indicate the importance of studying behaviour as the result of a complex system composed of factors from multiple levels, and the importance of using a national and a local sample to better identify local levers and obstacles."

It is unclear whether and how the vegetarians’ cognitions and emotions towards meat influence psychophysiological aspects such as salivation to food. The present study analysed voluntary (attitudes towards meat) and involuntary (emotions and salivation in response to images of food and real meat) behaviours, comparing vegetarians and omnivores. This study uses real meat and a measure of salivation to examine vegetarianism. The results showed that in vegetarians, attitudes and emotions towards meat were more negative than those of omnivores, while arousal towards meat was not different for vegetarians and omnivores. The salivation of vegetarians in response to real meat was not statistically different from that of omnivores. However, our results show that vegetarians’ salivation to real meat was similar to their baseline salivation. Our findings suggest that while vegetarians perceive meat as a negative non-appetizing stimulus at the cognitive and emotional level, at the involuntary psychophysiological level the perception of meat did not wholly suppress salivation and was perceived as a neutral non-appetizing stimulus."

Marchant, Antoine Lutz","Understanding the factors that predict why some individuals perceive to respond more to meditation training than others could impact the development, efficacy, adherence levels, and implementation of meditation-based interventions. We investigated individual-level variables associated with self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness to longer-term meditation training. This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) and includes 90 healthy older adults (65-84 years) that were randomised to an 18-month meditation training or a non-native language (English) training. Responsiveness was measured post-intervention using participants’ and teachers’ ratings of four psychological domains (connection, positive/negative emotions, meta-awareness) in relation to two contexts (during sessions, in daily life), teachers’ perception of overall benefit, and a global composite comprising all self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness measures. Linear regression modelling indicates that, when including baseline variables (sex, education, neuroticism, cognition, expectancy) and engagement (hours of formal practice during intervention), only higher levels of engagement were associated with higher global composite scores (standardised estimate=0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p&lt;0.001). Global composite scores were not correlated with pre-post changes in well-being. Findings indicate that more time spent practising meditation was related to greater perceived intervention effects.

Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here $\gamma$ and $\eta$ can also depend on the variables $\lambda$ and $s$. In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson's law of similarity on its own. At first we show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then $\xi$ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation.   Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016), in the second part of the third section we study the above model assuming that the mapping $\eta$ is multiplicatively translational.  First, we show how these mappings can be characterized.  Later on we turn to the examination of the so-called power law.  According to our results, the corresponding function $\xi$ then does not have a Fechnerian representation, but it do have a subtractive representation. As an application of the results of the subsection, we close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property."

This information-gathering process is critically mediated by attention, and our attention is, in turn, shaped by our previous experiences with—and learning about—stimuli and their consequences. In this review we highlight studies demonstrating a rapid and automatic influence of reward learning on attentional capture, and argue that these findings provide a human analogue of sign-tracking behaviour observed in non-human animals – wherein signals of reward gain incentive salience and become attractive targets for attention (and overt behaviour) in their own right. We then consider the implications of this idea for understanding the drivers of cue-controlled behaviour, with focus on addiction as a case in which choices with regard to reward-related stimuli can become injurious to health. We argue that motivated behaviour in general—and addiction in particular—can be understood within a ‘biased competition’ framework: different options and outcomes compete for attentional priority as a function of top-down goals, bottom-up salience, and prior experience, and the winner of this competition becomes the target for subsequent outcome-directed and flexible behaviour. Finally, we outline the implications of the biased-competition framework for cognitive, behavioural, and socioeconomic interventions for addiction."

Design: Secondary cost-effectiveness analyses from a randomized controlled trial of IERITA plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU only. Setting: Multi-site study at three child and adolescent mental health services in Sweden. Participants: Clinically referred and self-referred adolescent participants meeting diagnostic criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (N = 166) and their parents. Recruitment took place between November 20, 2017, and April 9, 2020. Interventions: Twelve weeks of IERITA delivered adjunctive to TAU versus TAU only. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical outcomes were frequency of nonsuicidal self-injury (primary outcome) and NSSI remission, assessed by the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory-Youth version and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated based on participant responses on the Kid-Screen 10. Intervention, health care sector, and societal costs were assessed using the parent-rated version of the Trimbos-iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness. Clinical outcomes and costs were measured before treatment, 1-month post-treatment (primary end-point), and 3-month post-treatment. Results: Adding IERITA to TAU was associated with improved clinical outcomes and increased costs at 1-month post-treatment, reducing one NSSI episode at a cost of \$2107 and achieving NSSI remission in one additional participant for \$8809. At 3-month post-treatment, IERITA was more effective in clinical outcomes and cost saving from both a societal (\$-2067) and health-care perspective (\$-425). IERITA had a 48-55% probability of being cost-effective at common QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds at 1-month post-treatment, which increased to 73-76% at the 3-month post-treatment. Conclusions: IERITA delivered adjunctive to TAU is a cost-effective treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury in youth, compared to TAU only. At the 3-month post-treatment assessment, IERITA was associated with both improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs."

Anecdote, theory, and emerging research suggest that itch experience is different in autistic people, with negative consequences. To address this, an online survey was completed by participants who self-categorised as diagnosed autistic (n=158), suspected autistic (n=37) or not autistic (n=85). We asked about three categories of itch: spontaneous, provoked, and itch caused by a medical condition, with questions focussed on severity, timing and duration, and impact on daily activities such as sleep. Across all categories of itch there was a pattern of greater severity, duration, and impact in diagnosed autistic people compared to non-autistic people, with large effect-size differences for spontaneous and provoked categories. Those with suspected autism largely fell between groups. Regression models showed itch severity associated with self-reported autistic traits. As expected, we found more dermatitis-related itch sufferers in autistic respondents. However, medical itch did not drive differences in spontaneous and provoked itch. Findings therefore suggest that the self-reported itch experience of autistic people is quantifiably more severe, longer lasting and of greater daily relevance, and that these differences cannot be attributed to the higher prevalence of skin dermatitis found in autism. Future studies are required to understand how itch experience fits into the broader picture of sensory differences, to understand mechanisms, and to develop management strategies for what can be a highly morbid experience."

It is therefore imperative that we improve our ability to predict the nature of the acute psychedelic experience to improve safety and optimize potential therapeutic outcomes. This study sought to validate the ‘Psychedelic Predictor Scale’ (PPS), a short, widely applicable, prospective measure intended to be predictive of salient dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Using four independent datasets in which the PPS was completed prospectively – two online surveys of ‘naturalistic’ use (N = 741, N = 836) and two controlled administration datasets (N = 30, N = 28) – we conducted factor analysis, regression, and correlation analyses to assess the construct, predictive, and convergent validity of the PPS. Our approach produced a 9-item scale with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.8) containing three factors: set, rapport, and intention. The PPS was significantly predictive of ‘mystical’, ‘challenging’, and ‘emotional breakthrough’ experiences. In a controlled administration dataset (N = 28), multiple regression found set and rapport explaining 40% of variance in mystical experience, and simple regression found set explained 16% of variance in challenging experience. In another (N = 30), rapport was related to emotional breakthrough explaining 9% of the variance. Together, these data suggest that the PPS is predictive of relevant acute features of the psychedelic experience in a broad range of contexts. We hope that this brief 9-item scale will be widely adopted for improved safety of psychedelic experiences in controlled settings and beyond."

This information-gathering process is critically mediated by attention, and our attention is, in turn, shaped by our previous experiences with—and learning about—stimuli and their consequences. In this review we highlight studies demonstrating a rapid and automatic influence of reward learning on attentional capture, and argue that these findings provide a human analogue of sign-tracking behaviour observed in non-human animals – wherein signals of reward gain incentive salience and become attractive targets for attention (and overt behaviour) in their own right. We then consider the implications of this idea for understanding the drivers of cue-controlled behaviour, with focus on addiction as a case in which choices with regard to reward-related stimuli can become injurious to health. We argue that motivated behaviour in general—and addiction in particular—can be understood within a ‘biased competition’ framework: different options and outcomes compete for attentional priority as a function of top-down goals, bottom-up salience, and prior experience, and the winner of this competition becomes the target for subsequent outcome-directed and flexible behaviour. Finally, we outline the implications of the biased-competition framework for cognitive, behavioural, and socioeconomic interventions for addiction."

Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here $\gamma$ and $\eta$ can also depend on the variables $\lambda$ and $s$. In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson's law of similarity on its own. At first we show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then $\xi$ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation.   Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016), in the second part of the third section we study the above model assuming that the mapping $\eta$ is multiplicatively translational.  First, we show how these mappings can be characterized.  Later on we turn to the examination of the so-called power law.  According to our results, the corresponding function $\xi$ then does not have a Fechnerian representation, but it do have a subtractive representation. As an application of the results of the subsection, we close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property."

Anecdote, theory, and emerging research suggest that itch experience is different in autistic people, with negative consequences. To address this, an online survey was completed by participants who self-categorised as diagnosed autistic (n=158), suspected autistic (n=37) or not autistic (n=85). We asked about three categories of itch: spontaneous, provoked, and itch caused by a medical condition, with questions focussed on severity, timing and duration, and impact on daily activities such as sleep. Across all categories of itch there was a pattern of greater severity, duration, and impact in diagnosed autistic people compared to non-autistic people, with large effect-size differences for spontaneous and provoked categories. Those with suspected autism largely fell between groups. Regression models showed itch severity associated with self-reported autistic traits. As expected, we found more dermatitis-related itch sufferers in autistic respondents. However, medical itch did not drive differences in spontaneous and provoked itch. Findings therefore suggest that the self-reported itch experience of autistic people is quantifiably more severe, longer lasting and of greater daily relevance, and that these differences cannot be attributed to the higher prevalence of skin dermatitis found in autism. Future studies are required to understand how itch experience fits into the broader picture of sensory differences, to understand mechanisms, and to develop management strategies for what can be a highly morbid experience."

Nonetheless, how temporal processing evolves across the lifetime as well as the links with the underlying neural substrates remains unclear. Here, we intend to retrace the main developmental stages of brain structure, function, and cognition linked to the emergence of timing abilities. This perspective aims to untangle the puzzling trajectory of temporal processing aspects across the lifetime, paving the way to novel neuropsychological assessments and cognitive rehabilitation strategies."

Design: Secondary cost-effectiveness analyses from a randomized controlled trial of IERITA plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU only. Setting: Multi-site study at three child and adolescent mental health services in Sweden. Participants: Clinically referred and self-referred adolescent participants meeting diagnostic criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (N = 166) and their parents. Recruitment took place between November 20, 2017, and April 9, 2020. Interventions: Twelve weeks of IERITA delivered adjunctive to TAU versus TAU only. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical outcomes were frequency of nonsuicidal self-injury (primary outcome) and NSSI remission, assessed by the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory-Youth version and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated based on participant responses on the Kid-Screen 10. Intervention, health care sector, and societal costs were assessed using the parent-rated version of the Trimbos-iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness. Clinical outcomes and costs were measured before treatment, 1-month post-treatment (primary end-point), and 3-month post-treatment. Results: Adding IERITA to TAU was associated with improved clinical outcomes and increased costs at 1-month post-treatment, reducing one NSSI episode at a cost of \$2107 and achieving NSSI remission in one additional participant for \$8809. At 3-month post-treatment, IERITA was more effective in clinical outcomes and cost saving from both a societal (\$-2067) and health-care perspective (\$-425). IERITA had a 48-55% probability of being cost-effective at common QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds at 1-month post-treatment, which increased to 73-76% at the 3-month post-treatment. Conclusions: IERITA delivered adjunctive to TAU is a cost-effective treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury in youth, compared to TAU only. At the 3-month post-treatment assessment, IERITA was associated with both improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs."
