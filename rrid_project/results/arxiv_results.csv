Choi', 'Rahul Datta', 'Mark J. Devlin', 'Matthew Hasselfield', 'Brian J. Koopman', 'Jeff McMahon', 'Sigurd Naess', 'Michael D. Niemack', 'Lyman A. Page', 'Suzanne T. Staggs', 'Robert Thornton', 'Edward J. Wollack']","We present an estimate of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) detector polarization angle systematic uncertainty from optics perturbation analysis using polarization-sensitive ray tracing in CODE V optical design software. Uncertainties in polarization angle calibration in CMB measurements can limit constraints on cosmic birefringence and other cosmological measurements. Our framework estimates the angle calibration systematic uncertainties from possible displacements in lens positions and orientations, and anti-reflection coating (ARC) thicknesses and refractive indices. With millimeter displacements in lens positions and percent-level perturbations in ARC thicknesses and indices from design, we find the total systematic uncertainty for three ACT detector arrays operating between 90--220 GHz to be at the tenth of degree scale. Reduced lens position and orientation uncertainties from physical measurements could lead to a reduction in the systematic uncertainty estimated with the framework presented here. This optical modeling can inform polarization angle systematic uncertainties for current and future microwave polarimeters, such as the CCAT Observatory, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4."

Mamba exhibits strong global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, making it highly attractive for point cloud analysis. To enable more effective processing of 3-D point cloud data by Mamba, we propose a novel Consistent Traverse Serialization to convert point clouds into 1-D point sequences while ensuring that neighboring points in the sequence are also spatially adjacent. Consistent Traverse Serialization yields six variants by permuting the order of x, y, and z coordinates, and the synergistic use of these variants aids Mamba in comprehensively observing point cloud data. Furthermore, to assist Mamba in handling point sequences with different orders more effectively, we introduce point prompts to inform Mamba of the sequence's arrangement rules. Finally, we propose positional encoding based on spatial coordinate mapping to inject positional information into point cloud sequences better. Based on these improvements, we construct a point cloud network named Point Cloud Mamba, which combines local and global modeling. Point Cloud Mamba surpasses the SOTA point-based method PointNeXt and achieves new SOTA performance on the ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart datasets."

Nogueras-Lara', 'R. Schödel', 'P. McMillan']","While orbital analysis studies were so far mainly focused on the Galactic halo, it is possible now to do these studies in the heavily obscured region close to the Galactic Centre. We aim to do a detailed orbital analysis of stars located in the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) of the Milky Way allowing us to trace the dynamical history of this structure. We integrated orbits of the observed stars in a non-axisymmetric potential. We used a Fourier transform to estimate the orbital frequencies. We compared two orbital classifications, one made by eye and the other with an algorithm, in order to identify the main orbital families. We also compared the Lyapunov and the frequency drift techniques to estimate the chaoticity of the orbits. We identified several orbital families as chaotic, $z$-tube, $x$-tube, banana, fish, saucer, pretzel, 5:4, and 5:6 orbits. As expected for stars located in a NSD, the large majority of orbits are identified as $z$-tubes (or as a sub-family of $z$-tubes). Since the latter are parented by $x_{2}$ orbits, this result supports the contribution of the bar (in which $x_{2}$ orbits are dominant in the inner region) in the formation of the NSD. Moreover, most of the chaotic orbits are found to be contaminants from the bar or bulge which would confirm the predicted contamination from the most recent NSD models. Based on a detailed orbital analysis, we were able to classify orbits into various families, most of which are parented by $x_{2}$-type orbits, which are dominant in the inner part of the bar."

We consider the functional equation $f(x)+x^k=f(x+1)$ and show that a solution can be derived from Faulhaber's formula for the sum of powers. We show how these solutions provide a characterization of Bernoulli numbers and related results.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00759,2024-03-01,Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and local solution to the non-stationary problem,"['Abramo Agosti', 'Michel Fremond']","In this paper we consider and generalize a model, recently proposed and analytically investigated in its quasi-stationary approximation by the authors, for visco-elasticity with large deformations and conditional compatibility, where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors. The model takes the form of a system of integro-differential coupled equations. Here, its derivation is generalized to consider mixed boundary conditions, which may represent a wider range of physical applications then the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in our previous contribution. This also introduces nontrivial technical difficulties in the theoretical framework, related to the definition and the regularity of the solutions of elliptic operators with mixed boundary conditions. As a novel contribution, we develop the analysis of the fully non-stationary version of the system where we consider inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a local in time weak solution in three space dimensions, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis."

It is a typical example that the model knows ""A's father is B"", but is unable to reason ""B's child is A"". This limitation poses a challenge to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a gap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root cause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the training and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language models to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly, permutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since this can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous permutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing challenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which addresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units (i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting these units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on reversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly advances the performance of existing works."

Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C IV, N V, and O VI simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, make it possible to probe C IV and O VI over a small range of redshift ($z \approx 0.12 - 0.15$). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of five showed signs of being produced by non-equilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and AGN winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization."

Cich', 'Brian Estey', 'Maya Fabrikant', 'David Hayes', 'Ian M. Hoffman', 'James Hostetter', 'Christopher Langer', 'Steven A. Moses', 'Abigail R. Perry', 'Timothy A. Peterson', 'Andrew Schaffer', 'Curtis Volin', 'Grahame Vittorini', 'William Cody Burton']","We present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining co-wiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the site-wise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site-dependent operations are achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$-$^{138}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ crystals and the other $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$-$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intra-site crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multi-site region of interest, we measure sub-quanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. These conditional transport operations display all necessary components for sorting qubits, and could be extended to implement other conditional operations involving control fields such as gates, initialization, and measurement."

Abrikosov', 'Gergely Barcza', 'Viktor Ivády']","Topological defects, such as Stone-Wales defects and grain boundaries, are common in 2D materials. In this exploratory study, we investigate the intricate interplay of carbon contamination and topological defects revealing a new class of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride. We demonstrate that carbon contamination and strain can both stabilize Stone-Wales configurations with desirable optical properties. Inspired by these results, we further demonstrate that carbon atoms at grain boundaries can resolve energetic B-B and N-N bonds and give rise to highly favorable atomic structures potentially leading to the accumulation of carbon contamination at grain boundaries. We identify carbon-contaminated topological defects that give rise to color centers emitting in the visible spectral range with short radiative lifetime and high Debye-Waller factors. Our discoveries shed light on a new class of defects and pave the way towards the identification of color centers and single photon emitters in hBN."

The resulting levels are described using a simple model Hamiltonian and the parameters in this model are extrapolated to the physical light-quark masses. In this framework, the QCD string tension is found to be $\sqrtσ=445(3)_{\rm stat}(6)_{\rm sys}$ MeV."

Tran', 'Matti Hiltunen', 'Theodore Karagioules', 'Dimitrios Koutsonikolas']","Low-latency video streaming over 5G has become rapidly popular over the last few years due to its increased usage in hosting virtual events, online education, webinars, and all-hands meetings. Our work aims to address the absence of studies that reveal the real-world behavior of low-latency video streaming. To that end, we provide an experimental methodology and measurements, collected in a US metropolitan area over a commercial 5G network, that correlates application-level QoE and lower-layer metrics on the devices, such as RSRP, RSRQ, handover records, etc., under both static and mobility scenarios. We find that RAN-side information, which is readily available on every cellular device, has the potential to enhance throughput estimation modules of video streaming clients, ultimately making low-latency streaming more resilient against network perturbations and handover events."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00751,2024-03-01,Machine learning that predicts well may not learn the correct physical descriptions of glassy systems,"['Arabind Swain', 'Sean Alexander Ridout', 'Ilya Nemenman']","The complexity of glasses makes it challenging to explain their dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising pathway for understanding glassy dynamics by linking their structural features to rearrangement dynamics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was one of the first methods used to detect such correlations. Specifically, a certain output of SVMs trained to predict dynamics from structure, the distance from the separating hyperplane, was interpreted as being linearly related to the activation energy for the rearrangement. By numerical analysis of toy models, we explore under which conditions it is possible to infer the energy barrier to rearrangements from the distance to the separating hyperplane. We observe that such successful inference is possible only under very restricted conditions. Typical tests, such as the apparent Arrhenius dependence of the probability of rearrangement on the inferred energy and the temperature, or high cross-validation accuracy do not guarantee success. We propose practical approaches for measuring the quality of the energy inference and for modifying the inferred model to improve the inference, which should be usable in the context of realistic datasets."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00750,2024-03-01,"Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds","['Boštjan Brešar', 'Babak Samadi']","Given a graph $G$, two edges $e_{1},e_{2}\in E(G)$ are said to have a common edge $e$ if $e$ joins an endvertex of $e_{1}$ to an endvertex of $e_{2}$. A subset $B\subseteq E(G)$ is an edge open packing set in $G$ if no two edges of $B$ have a common edge in $G$, and the maximum cardinality of such a set in $G$ is called the edge open packing number, $ρ_{e}^{o}(G)$, of $G$. In this paper, we prove that the decision version of the edge open packing number is NP-complete even when restricted to graphs with universal vertices, Eulerian bipartite graphs, and planar graphs with maximum degree $4$, respectively. In contrast, we present a linear-time algorithm that computes the edge open packing number of a tree. We also resolve two problems posed in the seminal paper [Edge open packing sets in graphs, RAIRO-Oper.\ Res.\ 56 (2022) 3765--3776]. Notably, we characterize the graphs $G$ that attain the upper bound $ρ_e^o(G)\le |E(G)|/δ(G)$, and provide lower and upper bounds for the edge-deleted subgraph of a graph and establish the corresponding realization result."

These estimators combine the advantages of unrestricted and restricted estimators. We derive the asymptotic distributional properties, including bias and mean squared error, for the proposed shrinkage estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our shrinkage estimators across various scenarios. Furthermore, we apply the proposed estimators to analyze a real dataset, showcasing their practical utility."

Our method follows a direct multiple shooting approach, and consists of applying the SQP method together with an $\ell_2$ augmented Lagrangian primal-dual merit function. We use the LQR algorithm to efficiently solve the primal-dual SQP problem. As our algorithm is a specialization of NPSQP (Gill et al. 1992), it inherits its generic properties, including global convergence, fast local convergence, and the lack of need for second order corrections, improving on existing direct multiple shooting approaches such as GNMS (Giftthaler et al. 2018) and FDDP (Mastalli et al. 2020)."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00747,2024-03-01,The QCD theta-parameter in canonical quantization,"['Wen-Yuan Ai', 'Bjorn Garbrecht', 'Carlos Tamarit']","The role of the QCD theta-parameter is investigated in pure Yang-Mills theory in the spacetime given by the four-dimensional Euclidean torus. While in this setting the introduction of possibly unphysical boundary conditions is avoided, it must be specified how the sum over the topological sectors is to be carried out. To connect with observables in real time, we perceive the partition function as the trace over the canonical density matrix. The system then corresponds to one of a finite temperature on a spatial three-torus. Carrying out the trace operation requires canonical quantization and gauge fixing. Fixing the gauge and demanding that the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is maintained leads to a restriction of the Hilbert space of physical wave functionals that generalizes the constraints derived from imposing Gauss' law. Consequently, we find that the states in the Hilbert space are properly normalizable under an inner product that integrates over each physical configuration represented by the gauge potential one time and one time only. The observables derived from the constrained Hilbert space do not violate charge-parity symmetry. We note that an exact hidden symmetry of the theory that is present for arbitrary values of theta in the Hamiltonian is effectively promoted to parity conservation in this constrained space. These results, derived on a torus in order to avoid the introduction of boundary conditions, also carry over to Minkowski spacetime when taking account of all possible gauge transformations."

The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00745,2024-03-01,AtP*: An efficient and scalable method for localizing LLM behaviour to components,"['János Kramár', 'Tom Lieberum', 'Rohin Shah', 'Neel Nanda']","Activation Patching is a method of directly computing causal attributions of behavior to model components. However, applying it exhaustively requires a sweep with cost scaling linearly in the number of model components, which can be prohibitively expensive for SoTA Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate Attribution Patching (AtP), a fast gradient-based approximation to Activation Patching and find two classes of failure modes of AtP which lead to significant false negatives. We propose a variant of AtP called AtP*, with two changes to address these failure modes while retaining scalability. We present the first systematic study of AtP and alternative methods for faster activation patching and show that AtP significantly outperforms all other investigated methods, with AtP* providing further significant improvement. Finally, we provide a method to bound the probability of remaining false negatives of AtP* estimates."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00744,2024-03-01,On the properties and implications of collapse-driven MHD turbulence,"['Enrique Vázquez-Semadeni', 'Yue Hu', 'Siyao Xu', 'Rubén Guerrero-Gamboa', 'Alex Lazarian']","We numerically investigate the driving of MHD turbulence by gravitational contraction using simulations of an initially spherical, magnetically supercritical cloud core with initially transonic and trans-Alfvénic turbulence. We perform a Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field, and investigate the evolution of its solenoidal and compressible parts, as well as of the velocity component along the gravitational acceleration vector, a proxy for the infall component of the velocity field. We find that: 1) In spite of being supercritical, the core first contracts to a sheet perpendicular to the mean field, and the sheet itself collapses. 2) The solenoidal component of the turbulence remains at roughly its initial level throughout the simulation, while the compressible component increases continuously. This implies that turbulence does {\it not} dissipate towards the center of the core. 3) The distribution of simulation cells in the $B$-$ρ$ plane occupies a wide triangular region at low densities, bounded below by the expected trend for fast MHD waves ($B \propto ρ$, applicable for high local Alfvénic Mach number $\Ma$) and above by the trend expected for slow waves ($B \sim$ constant, applicable for low local $\Ma$). At high densities, the distribution follows a single trend $B \propto ρ^{\gamef}$, with $1/2 < \gamef < 2/3$, as expected for gravitational compression. 4) The measured mass-to-magnetic flux ratio $λ$ increases with radius $r$, due to the different scalings of the mass and magnetic flux with $r$. At a fixed radius, $λ$ increases with time due to the accretion of material along field lines. 5) The solenoidal energy fraction is much smaller than the total turbulent component, indicating that the collapse drives the turbulence mainly compressibly, even in directions orthogonal to that of the collapse."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00743,2024-03-01,Neural Acceleration of Incomplete Cholesky Preconditioners,"['Joshua Dennis Booth', 'Hongyang Sun', 'Trevor Garnett']","The solution of a sparse system of linear equations is ubiquitous in scientific applications. Iterative methods, such as the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG), are normally chosen over direct methods due to memory and computational complexity constraints. However, the efficiency of these methods depends on the preconditioner utilized. The development of the preconditioner normally requires some insight into the sparse linear system and the desired trade-off of generating the preconditioner and the reduction in the number of iterations. Incomplete factorization methods tend to be black box methods to generate these preconditioners but may fail for a number of reasons. These reasons include numerical issues that require searching for adequate scaling, shifting, and fill-in while utilizing a difficult to parallelize algorithm. With a move towards heterogeneous computing, many sparse applications find GPUs that are optimized for dense tensor applications like training neural networks being underutilized. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple artificial neural network trained either at compile time or in parallel to the running application on a GPU can provide an incomplete sparse Cholesky factorization that can be used as a preconditioner. This generated preconditioner is as good or better in terms of reduction of iterations than the one found using multiple preconditioning techniques such as scaling and shifting. Moreover, the generated method also works and never fails to produce a preconditioner that does not reduce the iteration count."

Yet these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgments biased in problematic ways about groups like African Americans. While prior research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice: we extend research showing that Americans hold raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English and find that language models have the same prejudice, exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement. By contrast, the language models' overt stereotypes about African Americans are much more positive. We demonstrate that dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences by asking language models to make hypothetical decisions about people, based only on how they speak. Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that existing methods for alleviating racial bias in language models such as human feedback training do not mitigate the dialect prejudice, but can exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by teaching language models to superficially conceal the racism that they maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe employment of language technology."

In parallel, the field of condensed matter has flourished through the discovery of various materials exhibiting broken symmetries, often connected to topology and characterized by magneto-electric coupling. Here, we calculate the Casimir forces between materials with time-reversal symmetry and/or parity symmetry breaking. Remarkably, we obtain a universal phase diagram governing the sign of symmetry-breaking-induced Casimir forces, contributing to a comprehensive understanding on the sign of Casimir force for linear optical materials. The discovered phase diagram serves as a roadmap for searching repulsive Casimir forces, a subject bearing both theoretical interest and practical significance."

Fischer', 'Klaus Dolag', 'Hai-Bo Yu']","Dark matter (DM) haloes can be subject to gravothermal collapse if DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with them requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. The collapsed haloes are extreme systems that pose severe challenges to state-of-the-art codes used to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems with a focus on energy non-conservation. We run N-body simulations with and without DM self-interactions of an isolated DM-only halo and change numerical parameters relevant to the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for the DM self-interactions can lead to energy non-conservation but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we found are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; (c) SIDM velocity kicks break the symplectic nature and time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation to achieve a high accuracy allows for conserving energy not only at early stages of the evolution but also at late ones. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some problems making the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate, can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, others remain challenging. Our findings motivate further work on addressing these challenges."

Margine', 'Aleksey N. Kolmogorov']","Delithiation of the known layered LiBC compound was predicted to induce conventional superconductivity at liquid nitrogen temperatures but extensive experimental work over the past two decades has detected no signs of the expected superconducting transition. Using a combination of first-principles stability analysis and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, we have investigated possible Li$_x$BC morphologies and established what particular transformations of the planar honeycomb BC layers are detrimental to the material's superconductivity. We propose that Li$_x$BC reintercalation with select alkali and alkaline earth metals could lead to synthesis of otherwise inaccessible metastable Li$_x$M$_y$BC superconductors with critical temperatures ($T_{c}$) up to 73 K. The large-scale exploration of metal borocarbides has revealed that NaBC and Li$_{1/2}$Na$_y$BC layered phases are likely true ground states at low temperatures. The findings indicate that this compositional space may host overlooked synthesizable compounds with potential to break the $T_{c}$ record for conventional superconductivity in ambient-pressure materials."

Heule', 'Manfred Scheucher']","Satisfiability solving has been used to tackle a range of long-standing open math problems in recent years. We add another success by solving a geometry problem that originated a century ago. In the 1930s, Esther Klein's exploration of unavoidable shapes in planar point sets in general position showed that every set of five points includes four points in convex position. For a long time, it was open if an empty hexagon, i.e., six points in convex position without a point inside, can be avoided. In 2006, Gerken and Nicolás independently proved that the answer is no. We establish the exact bound: Every 30-point set in the plane in general position contains an empty hexagon. Our key contributions include an effective, compact encoding and a search-space partitioning strategy enabling linear-time speedups even when using thousands of cores."

Miró-Roig']","Mukai proved that the moduli space of simple sheaves on a smooth projective K3 surface is symplectic, and in \cite{FM2} we gave two constructions allowing one to construct new locally closed Lagrangian/isotropic subspaces of the moduli from old ones. In this paper, we extend both Mukai's result and our construction to reduced projective K3 surfaces; for the former we need to restrict our attention to perfect sheaves. There are two key points where we cannot get a straightforward generalization. In each, we need to prove that a certain differential form on the moduli space of simple, perfect sheaves vanishes, and we introduce a smoothability condition to complete the proof."

In particular, we carry out a spectral line stacking analysis considering $2875$ spectra of colour-selected star-forming galaxies undetected in HI at $0.23 < z < 0.49$ in the COSMOS field, extracted from the MIGHTEE-HI Early Science datacubes, acquired with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We stack galaxies belonging to different subsamples depending on three different definitions of large scale structure environment: local galaxy overdensity, position inside the host dark matter halo (central, satellite, or isolated), and cosmic web type (field, filament, or knot). We first stack the full star-forming galaxy sample and find a robust HI detection yielding an average galaxy HI mass of $M_{\rm HI}=(8.12\pm 0.75)\times 10^9\, {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\sim 11.8σ$. Next, we investigate the different subsamples finding a negligible difference in $M_{\rm HI}$ as a function of the galaxy overdensity. We report an HI excess compared to the full sample in satellite galaxies ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.31\pm1.22)\times 10^9$, at $\sim 10.2 σ$) and in filaments ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.62\pm 0.90)\times 10^9$. Conversely, we report non-detections for the central and knot galaxies subsamples, which appear to be HI-deficient. We find the same qualitative results also when stacking in units of HI fraction ($f_{\rm HI}$). We conclude that the HI amount in star-forming galaxies at the studied redshifts correlates with the large scale structure environment."

Myilswamy', 'Saleha Fatema', 'Navin B. Lingaraju', 'Andrew M.

While existing systems rely on bulk optics or integrated platforms with planar waveguide sections for spatial dispersion, they face limitations in achieving finer (few- or sub-GHz) spectrum control. These methods either demand considerable space or suffer from pronounced phase errors and optical losses when assembled to achieve fine resolution. Addressing these challenges, we present a foundry-fabricated six-channel silicon photonic shaper using microresonator filter banks with inline phase control and high spectral resolution. Leveraging existing comb-based spectroscopic techniques, we devise a novel system to mitigate thermal crosstalk and enable the versatile use of our on-chip shaper. Our results demonstrate the shaper's ability to phase-compensate six comb lines at tunable channel spacings of 3, 4, and 5 GHz. Specifically, at a 3 GHz channel spacing, we showcase the generation of arbitrary waveforms in the time domain. This scalable design and control scheme holds promise in meeting future demands for high-precision spectral shaping capabilities."

In the presence of radiation some of the symmetries are not Hamiltonian vector fields, hence the definition of charges for the symmetries becomes delicate. It can lead to the problem of field-dependent 2-cocycles in the charge algebra, as opposed to the central extensions allowed in standard classical mechanics. We show that if the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, its covariance requirement guarantees that the algebra of Noether currents is free of field-dependent 2-cocycles, and its stationarity requirement further removes central extensions. Therefore the charge algebra admits at most a time-independent field-dependent 2-cocycle, whose existence depends on the boundary conditions. We report on new results for asymptotic symmetries at future null infinity that can be derived with this approach."

To study the capability of current computer vision systems to recognize physically grounded spatial relations, we start by proposing precise relation definitions that permit consistently annotating a benchmark dataset. Despite the apparent simplicity of this task relative to others in the recognition literature, we observe that existing approaches perform poorly on this benchmark. We propose new approaches exploiting the long-range attention capabilities of transformers for this task, and evaluating key design principles. We identify a simple ""RelatiViT"" architecture and demonstrate that it outperforms all current approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first method to convincingly outperform naive baselines on spatial relation prediction in in-the-wild settings.

This is exemplified by rare-earth nickelates such as LaNiO$_{3}$, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO$_{3}$ into LaNiO$_{3}$ and is predicted to result in a high-spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x-ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we present direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilisation in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi-two-dimensional magnetic correlations and orbitally-polarized planar ligand holes make its electronic and magnetic configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S $\rightarrow$ 1 spin state instead."

Hallén et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature 571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure $Φ(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dotΦ(t)/μ_0$ is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 μs$ from monopole current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) = Bcos(ωt)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle $θ(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$ kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 μs$. This complex phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry."

During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This paper focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly 33% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality."

Existing few-shot relation extraction methods focus on uni-modal information such as text only. This reduces performance when there are no clear contexts between the name entities described in text. We propose a multi-modal few-shot relation extraction model (MFS-HVE) that leverages both textual and visual semantic information to learn a multi-modal representation jointly. The MFS-HVE includes semantic feature extractors and multi-modal fusion components. The MFS-HVE semantic feature extractors are developed to extract both textual and visual features. The visual features include global image features and local object features within the image. The MFS-HVE multi-modal fusion unit integrates information from various modalities using image-guided attention, object-guided attention, and hybrid feature attention to fully capture the semantic interaction between visual regions of images and relevant texts. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that semantic visual information significantly improves the performance of few-shot relation prediction."

These devices are essential components in superconducting quantum processors; they also serve as proxies for understanding the energy loss of superconducting qubits. By systematically varying several fabrication steps, we identify the relative importance of reducing loss at the substrate-metal and the substrate-air interfaces. We find that it is essential to clean the silicon substrate in hydrogen fluoride (HF) prior to aluminum deposition. A post-fabrication removal of the oxides on the surface of the silicon substrate and the aluminum film by immersion in HF further improves the $Q_i$. We observe a small, but noticeable, adverse effect on the loss by omitting either standard cleaning (SC1), pre-deposition heating of the substrate to 300$°$C, or in-situ post-deposition oxidation of the film's top surface. We find no improvement due to excessive pumping meant to reach a background pressure below $6{\times} 10^{-8}$ mbar.

The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlevé III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces."

This discussion clarifies conditions for quantum violations, as acknowledged in chiral theories. Then, we elucidate the subject of gauge anomaly cancellation when all fields are quantized. Such an outcome requires gauge invariance of the bosonic measure, so our first object is proving this invariance within Fujikawa's approach. Second, we investigate anomalies in fermionic perturbative amplitudes using Implicit Regularization. The discussion of the single-axial triangle fundaments this analysis, bringing the elements necessary to approach the single-axial box. When organizing their mathematical structure, we highlight the role of traces involving the chiral matrix. Choosing a specific expression for them reflects on the position of symmetry violations, which has implications regarding the linearity of integration. Power counting and tensor structure imply the presence of surface terms related to momenta ambiguities. We present the results without computing these surface terms.

To this end, we formulate the problem of adjusting FTRL's learning rate as a sequential decision-making problem and introduce the framework of competitive analysis. We establish a lower bound for the competitive ratio and propose update rules for learning rate that achieves an upper bound within a constant factor of this lower bound. Specifically, we illustrate that the optimal competitive ratio is characterized by the (approximate) monotonicity of components of the penalty term, showing that a constant competitive ratio is achievable if the components of the penalty term form a monotonically non-increasing sequence, and derive a tight competitive ratio when penalty terms are $ξ$-approximately monotone non-increasing. Our proposed update rule, referred to as \textit{stability-penalty matching}, also facilitates constructing the Best-Of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithms for stochastic and adversarial environments.

In this work, we investigate the hyperfine interaction between the spin-charge coupled transport of electrons and the nuclear spins in these surface states. Previous work has predicted that in the quantum spin Hall insulator phase, work can be extracted from a bath of polarized nuclear spins as a resource. We employ nonequilibrium Green's function analysis to show that a similar effect exists on the surface of a 3D topological insulator, albeit rescaled by the ratio between electronic mean free path and device length. The induced current due to thermal relaxation of polarized nuclear spins has an inductive nature. We emphasize the inductive response by rewriting the current-voltage relation in harmonic response as a lumped element model containing two parallel resistors and an inductor. In a low-frequency analysis, a universal inductance value emerges that is only dependent on the device's aspect ratio. This scaling offers a means of miniaturizing inductive circuit elements. An efficiency estimate follows from comparing the spin-flip induced current to the Ohmic contribution. The inductive effect is most prominent in topological insulators which have a large number of spinful nuclei per coherent segment, of which the volume is given by the mean free path length, Fermi wavelength and penetration depth of the surface state."

We determine the ScFF associated with the phase shifts of the leaky torus, closely related to the distribution of the zeros of Riemann zeta function. We compute the ScFF for the decay amplitude of a highly excited string states into two tachyons. We show that it displays the universal features expected from random matrix theory - a decline, a ramp and a plateau - and is in general agreement with the Gaussian unitary ensemble. It also shows some new features, owning to the special structure of the string amplitude, including a ""bump"" before the ramp associated with gaps in the average eigenvalue density. The ""bump"" is removed for highly excited string states with an appropriate state dependent unfolding.

Using a tight-binding model, we calculate the Andreev states formed in a Josephson junction where the link is a semiconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. As a result of both the spin-orbit interaction and induced superconductivity, the local charge and spin of these states varies as a function of externally controllable parameters: the phase difference between the superconducting leads, an applied magnetic field, and filling of the underlying semiconductor. Concomitantly, coupling to fluctuations of the electric or magnetic environment will vary, which informs the rate of dephasing. We qualitatively predict the dependence of dephasing on the nature of the environment, magnetic field, phase difference between the junction, and filling of the semiconductor. Comparing the simulated electric- and magnetic-noise-induced dephasing rate to experiment suggests that the dominant source of noise is magnetic. Moreover, by appropriately tuning these external parameters, we find sweet-spots at which we predict an enhancement in ASQ coherence times."

Back']","Exploring novel strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance, not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism, but also for unlocking potential practical applications. A well-established concept to date uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization, magnetic anisotropies, coercive field, Curie temperature and Gilbert damping, by modulating the charge carrier population within a capacitor structure. Note that the induced carriers are non-spin-polarized, so the control via the electric-field is independent of the direction of the magnetization. Here, we show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) of ultrathin Fe films can be reversibly modified by a spin current generated in Pt by the spin Hall effect. The effect decreases with increasing Fe thickness, indicating that the origin of the modification can be traced back to the interface. Uniquely, the change in MCA due to the spin current depends not only on the polarity of the charge current but also on the direction of magnetization, i.e. the change in MCA has opposite sign when the direction of magnetization is reversed. The control of magnetism by the spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of majority- and minority-spin bands, and differs significantly from the manipulation by gate voltages via a capacitor structure, providing a functionality that was previously unavailable and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices."

We show that any such flow behaves like a self-similar solution up to an exponential error in time. As an application, we show that smooth $n$-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly PIC1-pinched, with positive asymptotic volume ratio, are Euclidean. This confirms a higher dimensional version of a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott under the assumption of non-collapsing. It also yields a new and more direct proof of the original conjecture of Hamilton and Lott in three dimensions."

We propose an unsupervised machine learning method for contextual anomaly detection, which allows to support market surveillance aimed at identifying potential insider trading activities. This method lies in the reconstruction-based paradigm and employs principal component analysis and autoencoders as dimensionality reduction techniques. The only input of this method is the trading position of each investor active on the asset for which we have a price sensitive event (PSE). After determining reconstruction errors related to the trading profiles, several conditions are imposed in order to identify investors whose behavior could be suspicious of insider trading related to the PSE. As a case study, we apply our method to investor resolved data of Italian stocks around takeover bids."

Terhal', 'Leonardo DiCarlo', 'Earl T. Campbell']","Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates."

Beese', 'Zi-Kui Liu']","In the present study, the DFT+U method was employed to predict the thermodynamic properties of Cr2O3, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5. Results were benchmarked with experimental data showing high accuracy, except for the negative thermal expansion (NTE) of Nb2O5, which is attributed to its polymorphic complexity. Additionally, we extended our analysis to rutile-type oxides CrNbO4 and CrTaO4, examining their entropy and heat capacity at finite temperatures. CrNbO4 displayed slightly higher entropy and heat capacity at high temperatures. The mean linear thermal expansion coefficients for CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 from 500 K to 2000 K were predicted to be 6.00*10-6/K and 13.49*10-6/K, respectively, corroborating with DFT predictions and experimental evidence.

In its most general form, the guardedness discipline applies to general symmetric monoidal categories and further specializes to Cartesian and co-Cartesian categories, where it governs guarded recursion and guarded iteration respectively. Here, even more specifically, we deal with the semantics of call-by-value guarded iteration. It was shown by Levy, Power and Thielecke that call-by-value languages can be generally interpreted in Freyd categories, but in order to represent effectful function spaces, such a category must canonically arise from a strong monad. We generalize this fact by showing that representing guarded effectful function spaces calls for certain parametrized monads (in the sense of Uustalu). This provides a description of guardedness as an intrinsic categorical property of programs, complementing the existing description of guardedness as a predicate on a category."

Here, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) to investigate trap state formation in a diverse set of realistically passivated core-only InP and GaP QDs. Through orbital localization techniques, we deconvolute the dense manifold of trap states to allow for detailed assignment of surface defects. We find that the three-coordinate species dominate trapping in III-V QDs and identify features in the geometry and charge environment of trap centers capable of deepening, or sometimes passivating, traps. Furthermore, we observe stark differences in surface reconstruction between InP and GaP, where the more labile InP reconstructs to passivate three-coordinate indium at the cost of distortion elsewhere. These results offer explanations for experimentally observed trapping behavior and suggest new avenues for controlling trap states in III-V QDs."

Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels, i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra."

Traditional approaches to dose-finding in Phase I trials, such as the '3+3' method and the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM), provide a principled approach for escalating across dose levels. However, these methods lack the ability to incorporate uncertainty regarding the dose-toxicity ordering as found in combination drug trials. Under this setting, dose-levels vary across multiple drugs simultaneously, leading to multiple possible dose-toxicity orderings. The Partial Ordering CRM (POCRM) extends to these settings by allowing for multiple dose-toxicity orderings. In this work, it is shown that the POCRM is vulnerable to 'estimation incoherency' whereby toxicity estimates shift in an illogical way, threatening patient safety and undermining clinician trust in dose-finding models. To this end, the Bayesian model averaged POCRM (BMA-POCRM) is proposed. BMA-POCRM uses Bayesian model averaging to take into account all possible orderings simultaneously, reducing the frequency of estimation incoherencies. The effectiveness of BMA-POCRM in drug combination settings is demonstrated through a specific instance of estimate incoherency of POCRM and simulation studies. The results highlight the improved safety, accuracy and reduced occurrence of estimate incoherency in trials applying the BMA-POCRM relative to the POCRM model."

The work presented here is a study of the dark current emitted from the CLARA 3GHz 2.5 cell electron gun with exchangeable photocathode, which is a type of gun used for single pass high quality low emittance beams for uses such as Free Electron Lasers. The main purpose of these studies was to identify sources of dark current emission within the gun, by examining the dark current distribution and patterns on scintillating screens. It is shown that the features of the patterns can be reproduced qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively, by finite element simulations. Thus, certain surfaces within the gun and cathode apparatus which contribute most significantly to problematic dark current can be identified, and further development and preparation of the guns and their cathodes can be informed to minimise dark current."

Among these, optogenetic methods developed for live experiments in cell biology would benefit from such a localized illumination as it would improve the spatial resolution of diffusive photosensitive proteins leading to spatially constrained biological responses in specific subcellular organelles. Here, we describe a method to create and move a focused evanescent spot across the field of view of a high numerical aperture microscope objective, using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). We show that, after correcting the optical aberrations, light is confined within a spot of sub-micron lateral size and $\sim$100~nm axial depth, resulting in a volume of illumination drastically smaller than the one generated by a standard propagative focus. This evanescent focus is sufficient to induce a more intense and localized recruitment compared to a propagative focus on the optogenetic system CRY2-CIBN, improving the resolution of its pattern of activation."

Many systems in the literature do this by using a loudspeaker and microphones mounted on a vehicle. Symmetries in the environment lead to solution ambiguities for such systems. We propose to resolve this issue by placing the loudspeaker at a fixed location in the environment rather than on the vehicle. The question of whether this will remove ambiguities regardless of the environment geometry leads to a question about breaking symmetries that can be phrased in purely mathematical terms. We solve this question in the affirmative if the geometry is in dimension three or bigger, and give counterexamples in dimension two. Excluding the rare situations where the counterexamples arise, we also give an affirmative answer in dimension two. Our results lead to a simple path reconstruction algorithm for a vehicle carrying four microphones navigating within an environment in which a loudspeaker at a fixed position emits short bursts of sounds. This algorithm could be combined with other methods from the literature to construct a path tracking system for vehicles navigating within a potentially symmetric environment."

Each output sentence is selected from among multiple samples, conditioning on the previous selections, based on a simple token overlap score. We compare this ""Sample & Select"" method to greedy decoding, beam search, nucleus sampling, and the recently introduced hallucination avoiding decoders of DoLA, P-CRR, and S-CRR. We show that Sample & Select improves factuality by a 30% relative margin against these decoders in NLI-based evaluation on the subsets of CNN/DM and XSum used in the FRANK benchmark, while maintaining comparable ROUGE-1 F1 scores against reference summaries. We collect human verifications of the generated summaries, confirming the factual superiority of our method."

Doctors, for instance, may prescribe treatments by predicting the likely outcome of each available treatment. Actions of an expert thus naturally encode part of their domain knowledge, and can help make inferences within the same domain: Knowing doctors try to prescribe the best treatment for their patients, we can tell treatments prescribed more frequently are likely to be more effective. Yet in machine learning, the fact that most decision-makers are experts is often overlooked, and ""expertise"" is seldom leveraged as an inductive bias. This is especially true for the literature on treatment effect estimation, where often the only assumption made about actions is that of overlap. In this paper, we argue that expertise - particularly the type of expertise the decision-makers of a domain are likely to have - can be informative in designing and selecting methods for treatment effect estimation. We formally define two types of expertise, predictive and prognostic, and demonstrate empirically that: (i) the prominent type of expertise in a domain significantly influences the performance of different methods in treatment effect estimation, and (ii) it is possible to predict the type of expertise present in a dataset, which can provide a quantitative basis for model selection."

However, scheduling satellite communications in these satellite networks through efficiently creating a global satellite Contact Plan (CP) is a complex task, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being limited by onboard computational resources. The paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by modeling the constellations and CP as dynamic networks and employing graph-based techniques. The proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural network to evaluate the performance of a given CP and update it using a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. The trained neural network can predict the network delay with a mean absolute error of 3.6 minutes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully design a contact plan for large satellite networks, improving the delay by 29.1%, similar to a traditional approach, while performing the objective evaluations 20x faster."

The substantial demand for high-quality human motion data especially in online acquirement has led to a surge in human motion research works. Prior works have mainly concentrated on dual-modality learning, such as text and motion tasks, but three-modality learning has been rarely explored. Intuitively, an extra introduced modality can enrich a model's application scenario, and more importantly, an adequate choice of the extra modality can also act as an intermediary and enhance the alignment between the other two disparate modalities. In this work, we introduce LAVIMO (LAnguage-VIdeo-MOtion alignment), a novel framework for three-modality learning integrating human-centric videos as an additional modality, thereby effectively bridging the gap between text and motion. Moreover, our approach leverages a specially designed attention mechanism to foster enhanced alignment and synergistic effects among text, video, and motion modalities. Empirically, our results on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that LAVIMO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various motion-related cross-modal retrieval tasks, including text-to-motion, motion-to-text, video-to-motion and motion-to-video."

To achieve this task, one of the key point of the proposed method is the definition of high-dimensional audio prints, which are intrinsically (by design) robust to some sound degradations. The high dimensionality of this first representation is then used to learn a linear projection to a sub-space significantly smaller, which reduces again the sensibility to sound degradations using a series of discriminant analyses. Finally, anchoring the analysis times on local maxima of a selected onset function, an approximative hashing is done to provide a better tolerance to bit corruptions, and in the same time to make easier the scaling of the method."

However, when used for subpopulation discovery, mixture model inference is usually ill-defined a priori because the assumed observation model is only an approximation to the true data-generating process. Thus, as the number of observations increases, rather than obtaining better inferences, the opposite occurs: the data is explained by adding spurious subpopulations that compensate for the shortcomings of the observation model. However, there are two important sources of prior knowledge that we can exploit to obtain well-defined results no matter the dataset size: known causal structure (e.g., knowing that the latent subpopulations cause the observed signal but not vice-versa) and a rough sense of how wrong the observation model is (e.g., based on small amounts of expert-labeled data or some understanding of the data-generating process). We propose a new model selection criteria that, while model-based, uses this available knowledge to obtain mixture model inferences that are robust to misspecification of the observation model. We provide theoretical support for our approach by proving a first-of-its-kind consistency result under intuitive assumptions. Simulation studies and an application to flow cytometry data demonstrate our model selection criteria consistently finds the correct number of subpopulations."

By comparing the quantum and the classical description of the working medium, we single out genuine quantum effects with regards to the performance and the engine and refrigerator modes of the Otto cycle. The first example is a rotating electric dipole subjected to a controlled electric field, equivalent to a quantum pendulum. Here we find a systematic disadvantage of the quantum rotor compared to its classical counterpart. In contrast, a genuine quantum advantage can be observed with a charged rotor generating a magnetic moment that is subjected to a controlled magnetic field. Here, we prove that the classical rotor is inoperable as a working medium for any choice of parameters, whereas the quantum rotor supports an engine and a refrigerator mode, exploiting the quantum statistics during the cold strokes of the cycle."

Our findings reveal that the internal structure of these rubble-pile bodies significantly influences the impact outcomes. Specifically, we observe that the same impact energy can either catastrophically disrupt a target with a low boulder packing (<30 vol%), or result in the ejection of only a small fraction of material from a target with the same mass but high boulder packing (>40 vol%). This finding highlights the pivotal role played by the rubble-pile structure, effectively acting as a bulk shear strength, which governs the size and behaviour of the resulting impact. Consequently, understanding and characterising the internal structure of asteroids will be of paramount importance for any future efforts to deflect or disrupt an asteroid on a collision course with Earth."

The method is based on the observation that in almost all cases and for large problem classes the expression $\|T^ty\|^2$ deviates on the unit sphere $\|y\|=1$ the less from its mean value the higher the dimension $m$ is, a concentration of measure effect. The higher the dimension $m$, the faster the iteration converges."

Particularly in heterogeneous networks, it was empirically demonstrated that strategically distributing a limited number of test kits among nodes with higher degrees substantially diminishes the outbreak size. The network's dynamics were explored under varying values of infection rate. In this research, we expand upon these findings to investigate the influence of migration on infection dynamics within distinct communities of the network. Notably, we observe that nodes equipped with test kits and those without tend to segregate into two separate clusters when coupling strength is low, but beyond a critical threshold coupling coefficient, they coalesce into a unified cluster. Building on this clustering phenomenon, we develop a reduced equation model and rigorously validate its accuracy through comprehensive simulations. We show that this property is observed in both complete and random graphs."

Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets.

Heating this mixed particle system triggers the shrinking of the embedded microgels, which then vacate their lattice positions creating vacancy-interstitial pairs. We use temperature-controlled confocal laser scanning microscopy to verify and visualize the formation of the point defects. In addition, by re-swelling the microgels we quantify the local lattice distortion around an interstitial defect. Our experimental model system provides a unique opportunity to shed new light on the interplay between point defects, on the mechanisms of their diffusion, on their interactions, and on collective dynamics."

In particular, the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) with its Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) carries out transit, eclipse, and phase-curve spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres with unprecedented precision in a so far almost uncharted wavelength range. The precision and significance in the detection of molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres rely on a thorough understanding of the instrument itself and accurate data reduction methods. This paper aims to provide a clear description of the instrumental systematics that affect observations of transiting exoplanets through the use of simulations. We carried out realistic simulations of transiting-exoplanet observations with the MIRI LRS instrument that included the model of the exoplanet system, the optical path of the telescope, the MIRI detector performances, and instrumental systematics and drifts that could alter the atmospheric features we are meant to detect in the data. After introducing our pipeline, we show its performance on the transit of L168-9b, a super-Earth-sized exoplanet observed during the commissioning of the MIRI instrument. This paper provides a better understanding of the data themselves and of the best practices in terms of reduction and analysis through comparisons between simulations and real data. We show that simulations validate the current data-analysis methods. Simulations also highlight instrumental effects that impact the accuracy of our current spectral extraction techniques. These simulations are proven to be essential in the preparation of JWST observation programs and help us assess the detectability of various atmospheric and surface scenarios."

The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks."

Larsson']","Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. This work proposes a novel partially coherent (PC) transmission framework to cope with the challenge of phase misalignment among the access points (APs), which is important for unlocking the full potential of cell-free massive MIMO technology. With the PC operation, the APs are only required to be phase-aligned within clusters. Each cluster transmits the same data stream towards each user equipment (UE), while different clusters send different data streams. We first propose a novel algorithm to group APs into clusters such that the distance between two APs is always smaller than a reference distance ensuring the phase alignment of these APs. Then, we propose new algorithms that optimize the combining at UEs and precoding at APs to maximize the downlink sum data rates. We also propose a novel algorithm for data stream allocation to further improve the sum data rate of the PC operation. Numerical results show that the PC operation using the proposed framework with a sufficiently small reference distance can offer a sum rate close to the sum rate of the ideal fully coherent (FC) operation that requires network-wide phase alignment. This demonstrates the potential of PC operation in practical deployments of cell-free massive MIMO networks."

Given the constraint of limited resources, it is essential to leverage existing computational work (e.g., learned policies, samples) to enhance sample efficiency and reduce the computational resource consumption of DRL algorithms. Previous works to leverage existing computational work require intrusive modifications to existing algorithms and models, designed specifically for specific algorithms, lacking flexibility and universality. In this paper, we present the Snapshot Reinforcement Learning (SnapshotRL) framework, which enhances sample efficiency by simply altering environments, without making any modifications to algorithms and models. By allowing student agents to choose states in teacher trajectories as the initial state to sample, SnapshotRL can effectively utilize teacher trajectories to assist student agents in training, allowing student agents to explore a larger state space at the early training phase. We propose a simple and effective SnapshotRL baseline algorithm, S3RL, which integrates well with existing DRL algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating S3RL with TD3, SAC, and PPO algorithms on the MuJoCo benchmark significantly improves sample efficiency and average return, without extra samples and additional computational resources."

Despite the great progress, existing approaches still suffer from a dilemma between retrieval efficiency and asymmetric accuracy due to the limited capacity of the lightweight query model. In this work, we propose an Asymmetric Feature Fusion (AFF) paradigm, which advances existing asymmetric retrieval systems by considering the complementarity among different features just at the gallery side. Specifically, it first embeds each gallery image into various features, e.g., local features and global features. Then, a dynamic mixer is introduced to aggregate these features into compact embedding for efficient search. On the query side, only a single lightweight model is deployed for feature extraction. The query model and dynamic mixer are jointly trained by sharing a momentum-updated classifier. Notably, the proposed paradigm boosts the accuracy of asymmetric retrieval without introducing any extra overhead to the query side. Exhaustive experiments on various landmark retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of our paradigm."

The result on the leading order asymptotics for the maximum of the log-characteristic polynomial is new for random normal matrices.

Nevertheless, it is still not being considered as the primary choice for the industry due to some of its major inherent challenges, including complex and dynamic process interactions, which are sometimes difficult to fully understand even with traditional machine learning because of the involvement of high-dimensional data such as images, point clouds, and voxels. However, the recent emergence of deep learning (DL) is showing great promise in overcoming many of these challenges as DL can automatically capture complex relationships from high-dimensional data without hand-crafted feature extraction. Therefore, the volume of research in the intersection of AM and DL is exponentially growing each year which makes it difficult for the researchers to keep track of the trend and future potential directions. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review paper in this research track summarizing the recent studies. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent studies that apply DL for making the AM process better with a high-level summary of their contributions and limitations. Finally, it summarizes the current challenges and recommends some of the promising opportunities in this domain for further investigation with a special focus on generalizing DL models for wide-range of geometry types, managing uncertainties both in AM data and DL models, overcoming limited and noisy AM data issues by incorporating generative models, and unveiling the potential of interpretable DL for AM."

These two bands promise to unlock a large portion of untapped spectrum, but the harsh propagation due to the increased carrier frequency might negatively impact the performance of urban Radio Access Network (RAN) deployments. Within the span of a year, two co-located 5G networks operating in these frequency bands were deployed at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, entirely dedicated to the dense urban performance assessment of the two systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the measurement campaigns conducted on them, with the U6G campaign representing the first of its kind. A benchmark is provided by ray-tracing simulations. The results suggest that networks operating in these frequency bands provide good indoor and outdoor coverage and throughput in urban scenarios, even when deployed in the macro base station setup common to lower frequencies. In addition, a comparative performance analysis of these two key technologies is provided, offering insights on their relative strengths, weaknesses and improvement margins and informing on which bands is better suited for urban macro coverage."

Numerical simulations of the impact provide a means to explore target surface material properties and structures, consistent with the observed momentum deflection efficiency, ejecta cone geometry, and ejected mass. Our simulation, which best matches observations, indicates that Dimorphos is weak, with a cohesive strength of less than a few pascals (Pa), similar to asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. We find that a bulk density of Dimorphos, rhoB, lower than 2400 kg/m3, and a low volume fraction of boulders (<40 vol%) on the surface and in the shallow subsurface, are consistent with measured data from the DART experiment. These findings suggest Dimorphos is a rubble pile that might have formed through rotational mass shedding and re-accumulation from Didymos. Our simulations indicate that the DART impact caused global deformation and resurfacing of Dimorphos. ESA's upcoming Hera mission may find a re-shaped asteroid, rather than a well-defined crater."

In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36\%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data."

This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data."

Polyps, as the main biomarker of the disease, are detected, localized, and characterized through colonoscopy procedures. Nonetheless, during the examination, up to 25% of polyps are missed, because of challenging conditions (camera movements, lighting changes), and the close similarity of polyps and intestinal folds. Besides, there is a remarked subjectivity and expert dependency to observe and detect abnormal regions along the intestinal tract. Currently, publicly available polyp datasets have allowed significant advances in computational strategies dedicated to characterizing non-parametric polyp shapes. These computational strategies have achieved remarkable scores of up to 90% in segmentation tasks. Nonetheless, these strategies operate on cropped and expert-selected frames that always observe polyps. In consequence, these computational approximations are far from clinical scenarios and real applications, where colonoscopies are redundant on intestinal background with high textural variability. In fact, the polyps typically represent less than 1% of total observations in a complete colonoscopy record. This work introduces COLON: the largest COlonoscopy LONg sequence dataset with around of 30 thousand polyp labeled frames and 400 thousand background frames. The dataset was collected from a total of 30 complete colonoscopies with polyps at different stages, variations in preparation procedures, and some cases the observation of surgical instrumentation. Additionally, 10 full intestinal background video control colonoscopies were integrated in order to achieve a robust polyp-background frame differentiation. The COLON dataset is open to the scientific community to bring new scenarios to propose computational tools dedicated to polyp detection and segmentation over long sequences, being closer to real colonoscopy scenarios."

Mostly, they occur in dialogical form where an {\em explainer} discusses a concept or phenomenon of interest with an {\em explainee}. Leaving the explainee with a clear understanding is not straightforward due to the knowledge gap between the two participants. Previous research looked at the interaction of explanation moves, dialogue acts, and topics in successful dialogues with expert explainers. However, daily-life explanations often fail, raising the question of what makes a dialogue successful. In this work, we study explanation dialogues in terms of the interactions between the explainer and explainee and how they correlate with the quality of explanations in terms of a successful understanding on the explainee's side. In particular, we first construct a corpus of 399 dialogues from the Reddit forum {\em Explain Like I am Five} and annotate it for interaction flows and explanation quality. We then analyze the interaction flows, comparing them to those appearing in expert dialogues. Finally, we encode the interaction flows using two language models that can handle long inputs, and we provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness boost gained through the encoding in predicting the success of explanation dialogues."

Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $Ω_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\barτ_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\barτ_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) < 4\times 10^{-20} Ω^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$."

Moreover, these extractable bounds are guaranteed to be highly uniform in the sense that they will be independent of all parameters relating to the underlying probability space, particularly regarding events or measures of them. As such, these results, in particular, provide the first logical explanation for the success and the observed uniformities of the previous ad hoc case studies of proof mining in these areas and further illustrate their extent. Beyond these systems, we provide extensions for the proof-theoretically tame treatment of $σ$-algebras and associated probability measures using an intensional approach to infinite unions.

SEP onset times are determined using the Poisson-CUSUM method. SEP peak times and intensities refer to the global intensity maximum. If different viewing directions are available, we use the one with the earliest onset for the onset determination and the one with the highest peak intensity for the peak identification. Associated flares are identified using observations from near Earth and Solar Orbiter. Associated type II radio bursts are determined from ground-based observations in the metric frequency range and from spacecraft observations in the decametric range. The current version of the catalog contains 45 multi-spacecraft events observed in the period from Nov 2020 until May 2023, of which 13 were widespread events and four were classified as narrow-spread events. Using X-ray observations by GOES/XRS and Solar Orbiter/STIX, we were able to identify the associated flare in all but four events.

Kinematic information from associated jets is combined using matrix element techniques to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects at the production vertex. A simultaneous measurement of four Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons is performed in the framework of a standard model effective field theory.

Baalrud']","Molecular dynamics simulations are used to test when the particle-in-cell (PIC) method applies to atmospheric pressure plasmas. It is found that PIC applies only when the plasma density and macroparticle weight are sufficiently small because of two effects associated with correlation heating. The first is the physical effect of disorder-induced heating (DIH). This occurs if the plasma density is large enough that a species (typically ions) is strongly correlated in the sense that the Coulomb coupling parameter exceeds one. In this situation, DIH causes ions to rapidly heat following ionization. PIC is not well suited to capture DIH because doing so requires using a macroparticle weight of one and a grid that well resolves the physical interparticle spacing. These criteria render PIC intractable for macroscale domains. The second effect is a numerical error due to Artificial Correlation Heating (ACH). ACH is like DIH in that it is caused by the Coulomb repulsion between particles, but differs in that it is a numerical effect caused by a macroparticle weight larger than one. Like DIH, it is associated with strong correlations. However, here the macroparticle coupling strength is found to scale as $Γw^{2/3}$, where $Γ$ is the physical coupling strength and $w$ is the macroparticle weight. So even if the physical coupling strength of a species is small, as is expected for electrons in atmospheric pressure plasmas, a sufficiently large macroparticle weight can cause the macroparticles to be strongly coupled and therefore heat due to ACH. Furthermore, it is shown that simulations in reduced dimensions exacerbate these issues."

To tackle this pressing challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax, Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally, we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming years and propose two policies for reducing total fossil CO2 emissions. Our research aims to provide policy-makers with accurate and detailed information to support effective climate change mitigation strategies."

The {\em Hoffman polynomial} $h(t)$ of $Γ=Γ(A)$ is the unique polynomial of smallest degree satisfying $h(A)=J$, where $J$ denotes the all-ones matrix. Let $X$ denote a nonempty finite set. A nonnegative matrix $B\in{\mbox{Mat}}_X({\mathbb R})$ is called {\em $λ$-doubly stochastic} if $\sum_{z\in X} (B)_{yz}=\sum_{z\in X} (B)_{zy}=λ$ for each $y\in X$. In this paper we first show that there exists a polynomial $h(t)$ such that $h(B)=J$ if and only if $B$ is a $λ$-doubly stochastic irreducible matrix. This result allows us to define the Hoffman polynomial of a $λ$-doubly stochastic irreducible matrix."

More generally, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets which amounts to solving a Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Ampère type equations. Our main purpose is to show the existence, regularity and uniqueness of solution to this problem in case $p\geq 1$ by studying variational properties for a family of Monge-Ampère functinals. We also discuss the existence and optimal global Hölder regularity in case $p<1$ and $q\geq n$."

For a trial wave function consisting of a small configuration interaction (CI) wave function obtained from full CI quantum Monte Carlo and reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation, we find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients of the initial CI wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the non-backflow VMC and backflow DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolate and intersect with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for the C2, N2, CO2, and H2O molecules, as well as for the C2 molecule in its first electronic singlet excited state, using only small CI expansion sizes."

The key to asymmetric image retrieval is realizing feature compatibility between different models. Despite the great progress, most existing approaches either rely on classifiers inherited from gallery models or simply impose constraints at the instance level, ignoring the structure of embedding space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective structure similarity preserving method to achieve feature compatibility between query and gallery models. Specifically, we first train a product quantizer offline with the image features embedded by the gallery model. The centroid vectors in the quantizer serve as anchor points in the embedding space of the gallery model to characterize its structure. During the training of the query model, anchor points are shared by the query and gallery models. The relationships between image features and centroid vectors are considered as structure similarities and constrained to be consistent. Moreover, our approach makes no assumption about the existence of any labeled training data and thus can be extended to an unlimited amount of data. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale landmark retrieval demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is released at: https://github.com/MCC-WH/SSP."

Stability is a fundamental attribute of dynamical systems, yet it is not always assured in models derived through inference. Our main objective is to develop a method that facilitates the inference of quadratic control dynamical systems with inherent stability guarantees. To this aim, we investigate the stability characteristics of control systems with energy-preserving nonlinearities, thereby identifying conditions under which such systems are bounded-input bounded-state stable. These insights are subsequently applied to the learning process, yielding inferred models that are inherently stable by design.

By utilizing the internal model approach and the adaptive control technique, a distributed adaptive internal model is constructed for each agent. Then, based on this internal model, a fully distributed ETC strategy composed of a distributed event-triggered adaptive output feedback control law and a distributed dynamic event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which each agent updates its control input at its own triggering time instants. It is shown that under the proposed ETC strategy, the robust cooperative output regulation problem can be solved without requiring either the global information associated with the communication topology or the bounds of the uncertain or unknown parameters in each agent and the exosystem. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

However, due to the randomness in the diffusion process, they often struggle with handling diverse low-level tasks that require details preservation. To overcome this limitation, we present a new Diff-Plugin framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to generate high-fidelity results across a variety of low-level tasks. Specifically, we first propose a lightweight Task-Plugin module with a dual branch design to provide task-specific priors, guiding the diffusion process in preserving image content. We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction, allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods, particularly in real-world scenarios. Our ablations further validate that Diff-Plugin is stable, schedulable, and supports robust training across different dataset sizes."

The seminal work by \citet{Wang2020UnderstandingCR} introduced a uniformity metric that quantitatively measures the collapse degree of learned representations. Directly optimizing this metric together with alignment proves to be effective in preventing constant collapse. However, we present both theoretical and empirical evidence revealing that this metric lacks sensitivity to dimensional collapse, highlighting its limitations. To address this limitation and design a more effective uniformity metric, this paper identifies five fundamental properties, some of which the existing uniformity metric fails to meet. We subsequently introduce a novel uniformity metric that satisfies all of these desiderata and exhibits sensitivity to dimensional collapse. When applied as an auxiliary loss in various established self-supervised methods, our proposed uniformity metric consistently enhances their performance in downstream tasks.Our code was released at https://github.com/sunset-clouds/WassersteinUniformityMetric."

However, accounting for potential communication loss or the unavailability of communication infrastructures in these application domains remains an open problem. Much of the applicable MRS research assumes that the system can sustain communication through proximity regulations and formation control or by devising a framework for separating and adhering to a predetermined plan for extended periods of disconnection. The latter technique enables an MRS to be more efficient, but breakdowns and environmental uncertainties can have a domino effect throughout the system, particularly when the mission goal is intricate or time-sensitive. To deal with this problem, our proposed framework has two main phases: i) a centralized planner to allocate mission tasks by rewarding intermittent rendezvous between robots to mitigate the effects of the unforeseen events during mission execution, and ii) a decentralized replanning scheme leveraging epistemic planning to formalize belief propagation and a Monte Carlo tree search for policy optimization given distributed rational belief updates. The proposed framework outperforms a baseline heuristic and is validated using simulations and experiments with aerial vehicles."

In this proceedings contribution, improved predictions obtained for the LHC (at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV) up to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) in TMD factorisation are presented.

Procedures involving machine-assisted techniques used to inform the design decision have seen a considerable growth in popularity among the EIC detector community.

First, we briefly review the case of equations with globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, for which an error rate of at least $1/2$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is always guaranteed by using the equidistant Euler-Maruyama scheme. Then we illustrate that giving up the global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients may lead to a non-polynomial decay of the error for the Euler-Maruyama scheme or even to an arbitrary slow decay of the smallest possible error that can be achieved on the basis of finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion. Finally, we turn to recent positive results for equations with a drift coefficient that is not globally Lipschitz continuous. Here we focus on scalar equations with a Lipschitz continuous diffusion coefficient and a drift coefficient that satisfies piecewise smoothness assumptions or has fractional Sobolev regularity and we present corresponding complexity results."

Graph neural networks (GNNs) demonstrate greater efficiency than traditional CNN methods in analyzing this data, preserving spatial pathology context. Additionally, GNNs provide significant insights through explainable AI techniques.

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of this instrumentally observed meteorite fall, which occurred as predicted west of Berlin, Germany. The atmospheric trajectory was quite steep with an average slope to the Earth's surface 75.6 degrees. The entry speed was 15.20 km/s. The heliocentric orbit calculated from the bolide data agrees very well with the asteroid data. However, the bolide was fainter than expected for a reportedly meter-sized asteroid. The absolute magnitude reached -14.4 and the entry mass was estimated to 140 kg. The recorded bolide spectrum was low in iron from what an enstatite-rich meteorite was expected. Indeed, the recovered meteorites, called Ribbeck, were classified as aubrites. The high albedo of enstatite (E-type) asteroids can explain the size discrepancy. The asteroid was likely smaller than 0.5 meter and should be rather called a meteoroid. During the atmospheric entry, the meteoroid severely fragmented into much smaller pieces already at a height of 55 km under the aerodynamic pressure of 0.12 MPa. The primary fragments were then breaking-up again, most frequently at heights 39-29 km (0.9-2.2 MPa). Numerous small meteorites and up to four stones larger than 100g were expected to land. Within a few days of publishing the strewn field dozens of meteorites were found in the area we predicted."

Borges', 'Joshua Bauer', 'Sebastian Werner', 'Michael Gebauer', 'Stefan Tai']","Observability is important to ensure the reliability of microservice applications. These applications are often prone to failures, since they have many independent services deployed on heterogeneous environments. When employed ""correctly"", observability can help developers identify and troubleshoot faults quickly. However, instrumenting and configuring the observability of a microservice application is not trivial but tool-dependent and tied to costs. Architects need to understand observability-related trade-offs in order to weigh between different observability design alternatives. Still, these architectural design decisions are not supported by systematic methods and typically just rely on ""professional intuition"". In this paper, we argue for a systematic method to arrive at informed and continuously assessable observability design decisions. Specifically, we focus on fault observability of cloud-native microservice applications, and turn this into a testable and quantifiable property. Towards our goal, we first model the scale and scope of observability design decisions across the cloud-native stack. Then, we propose observability metrics which can be determined for any microservice application through so-called observability experiments. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our experiment tool OXN. OXN is able to inject arbitrary faults into an application, similar to Chaos Engineering, but also possesses the unique capability to modify the observability configuration, allowing for the assessment of design decisions that were previously left unexplored. We demonstrate our approach using a popular open source microservice application and show the trade-offs involved in different observability design decisions."

Through numerical simulations of the coupled Ginzburg-Landau and heat-diffusion equations, we show that this design is capable of efficiently breaking the reciprocity of the critical current in the central superconductor, thus promoting the diode effect in response to an applied AC current. By adjusting the DC bias in the wires, we find the optimum inhomogeneous field profile that facilitates the entrance of vortices and antivortices in a given polarity of the applied AC current and impede their entrance in the other polarity. This way, the system behaves as an ideal superconducting half-wave rectifier, with diode efficiencies surpassing 70%. Furthermore, we detail the behavior and diode efficiency of the system under different experimental conditions, such as the substrate heat transfer coefficient and the sweep rate of the external current."

Existing works commonly employ CNN-based or self-attention-based modules as transform methods for compression. However, there is no prior research on neural transform that focuses on specific regions. In response, we introduce the class-agnostic segmentation masks (i.e. semantic masks without category labels) for extracting region-adaptive contextual information. Our proposed module, Region-Adaptive Transform, applies adaptive convolutions on different regions guided by the masks. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play module named Scale Affine Layer to incorporate rich contexts from various regions. While there have been prior image compression efforts that involve segmentation masks as additional intermediate inputs, our approach differs significantly from them. Our advantages lie in that, to avoid extra bitrate overhead, we treat these masks as privilege information, which is accessible during the model training stage but not required during the inference phase. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ class-agnostic masks as privilege information and achieve superior performance in pixel-fidelity metrics, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).

The anticipated pile-up increase at HL-LHC conditions and beyond, requires the addition of < 50 ps per hit timing information to successfully resolve displaced and primary vertices. In this study, the timing performance, uniformity and efficiency of neutron and proton irradiated single pixel 3D devices is discussed.

For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the $^{13}$CN $N=2-1$ hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially-resolved detection of $^{13}$CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio for the first time. We conducted non-local thermal equilibrium modeling of the $^{13}$CN lines in conjunction with previously observed $^{12}$CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, ${\rm H_2}$ volume density, and column densities of $^{12}$CN and $^{13}$CN. The ${\rm H_2}$ volume density is found to range between $ (4 - 10)\times10^7 \ {\rm cm^{-3}}$, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk upper layer. The $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio is measured to be $ 70^{+9}_{-6}$ at $30 < r < 80$ au from the central star, which is similar to the $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of $\rm ^{12}C$ into the solid phase towards the disk midplane.

However, fine-tuning these models on new tasks can lead to unfair outcomes. This is due to the absence of generalization guarantees for fairness properties, regardless of whether the original pre-trained model was developed with fairness considerations. To tackle this issue, we introduce an efficient and robust fine-tuning framework specifically designed to mitigate biases in new tasks. Our empirical analysis shows that the parameters in the pre-trained model that affect predictions for different demographic groups are different, so based on this observation, we employ a transfer learning strategy that neutralizes the importance of these influential weights, determined using Fisher information across demographic groups. Additionally, we integrate this weight importance neutralization strategy with a matrix factorization technique, which provides a low-rank approximation of the weight matrix using fewer parameters, reducing the computational demands. Experiments on multiple pre-trained models and new tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

For these two cases, we calculate analytical expression for transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, at constant temperature freeze-out hypersurface using Cooper-Frye prescription. We compare our results for transverse momentum spectra with experimental results from Large Hadron Collider and CERN SPS where one expects cylindrical and spherical geometry of the fireball, respectively. In the case of low-energy collisions with spherical geometry, we calculate rapidity spectra and compare with the results from CERN SPS."

Adams']","We establish a theoretical framework of the particle relaxation method for uniform particle generation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We achieve this by reformulating the particle relaxation as an optimization problem. The objective function is an integral difference between discrete particle-based and smoothed-analytical volume fractions. The analysis demonstrates that the particle relaxation method in the domain interior is essentially equivalent to employing a gradient descent approach to solve this optimization problem, and we can extend such an equivalence to the bounded domain by introducing a proper boundary term. Additionally, each periodic particle distribution has a spatially uniform particle volume, denoted as characteristic volume. The relaxed particle distribution has the largest characteristic volume, and the kernel cut-off radius determines this volume. This insight enables us to control the relaxed particle distribution by selecting the target kernel cut-off radius for a given kernel function."

Heath Jr']","The use of one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has been considered as a viable alternative to high resolution counterparts in realizing and commercializing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the issue of discarding the amplitude information by one-bit quantizers has to be compensated. Thus, carefully tailored methods need to be developed for one-bit channel estimation and data detection as the conventional ones cannot be used. To address these issues, the problems of one-bit channel estimation and data detection for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system that operates over uncorrelated frequency selective channels are investigated here. We first develop channel estimators that exploit Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and approximated versions of it as the so-called weak classifiers in an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) approach. Particularly, the combination of the approximated GDA classifiers with AdaBoost offers the benefit of scalability with the linear order of computations, which is critical in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. We then take advantage of the same idea for proposing the data detectors. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed channel estimators and data detectors compared to other methods. They show comparable/better performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods, but require dramatically lower computational complexities and run times."

We use the method of inducing from ergodic theory to study invariant measures of these two types of Markov chains in the case when the initial chain $Y$ has a known invariant measure. We give explicit formulas for invariant measures of the entrance and exit chains under certain recurrence-type assumptions on $A$ and $A^c$, which apply even for transient chains.

In this paper, we study embedding distortions produced by Correspondence Analysis and its robust l1 variant Taxicab Correspondence analysis, which are visualization methods for contingency tables. For high dimensional data, distortions in Correspondence Analysis are contractions; while distortions in Taxicab Correspondence Analysis could be contractions or stretchings. This shows that Euclidean geometry is quite rigid, because of the orthogonality property; while Taxicab geometry is quite flexible, because the orthogonality property is replaced by the conjugacy property."

A natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance, leading to an improvement across all investigated methods."

Byland', 'Xinze Yang', 'Morgan Walker', 'Aaron G. Greenberg', 'Peter Klavins', 'Eduardo Miranda', 'Adrian Gozar', 'Valentin Taufour', 'Rafael M. Fernandes', 'Eduardo H. da Silva Neto']","Nematic phases, where electrons in a solid spontaneously break rotational symmetry while preserving the translational symmetry, exist in several families of unconventional superconductors [1, 2]. Although superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically [3-7], it has yet to be unambiguously identified experimentally [8, 9]. A major challenge is that nematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as magnetism and charge order. The FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ family of iron based superconductors provides a unique opportunity to explore this concept, as it features an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur substitution at a quantum critical point (QCP) near $x_c = 0.17$, where nematic fluctuations are the largest [10-12]. Here, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements to visualize Boguliubov quasiparticle interference patterns, from which we determined the momentum structure of the superconducting gap near the Brillouin zone $Γ$ point of FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$. The results reveal an anisotropic, near nodal gap with minima that are $45^\circ$ rotated with respect to the Fe-Fe direction, characteristic of a nematic pairing interaction, contrary to the usual isotropic gaps due to spin mediated pairing in other tetragonal Fe-based superconductors. The results are also in contrast with pristine FeSe, where the pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations and the gap minima are aligned with the Fe-Fe direction. Therefore, the measured gap structure demonstrates not only a fundamental change of the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, but it also indicates the existence of superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations in FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$."

The main challenge of the SIFC problem lies in the coupling of complete sensing (for mapping) and robotic footprint (for filling) coverage tasks. Initially, we assume known target information (e.g., crack) and employ classic cell decomposition methods to achieve complete sensing coverage of the workspace and complete robotic footprint coverage using the least-cost route. Subsequently, we generalize the algorithm to handle unknown target information, allowing the robot to scan and incrementally construct the target graph online while conducting robotic footprint coverage. The online polynomial-time SIFC planning algorithm minimizes the total robot traveling distance, guarantees complete sensing coverage of the entire workspace, and achieves near-optimal robotic footprint coverage, as demonstrated through empirical experiments. For the demonstrated application, we design coordinated nozzle motion control with the planned robot trajectory to efficiently fill all cracks within the robot's footprint. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the algorithm's design, performance, and comparisons. The SIFC algorithm offers a high-efficiency motion planning solution for various robotic applications requiring simultaneous sensing and actuation coverage."

Scully']","High purity magnesium and a Mg-Al 5wt% Zn metal rich primer (MRP) were compared for their ability to suppress intergranular corrosion (IGC) and intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IG-SCC) in peak aged AA 7075-T651 by sacrificial anode-based cathodic prevention. Tests were conducted in 0.6 M NaCl solution under full immersion. These evaluations considered the ability of the primer to attain an intermediate negative open circuit potential (OCP) such that the galvanic couple potential with bare aluminum alloy (AA) 7075-T651 resided below a range of potentials where IGC is prevalent. The ability of the primer to achieve an OCP negative enough that the AA 7075-T651 could be protected by sacrificial anode-based cathodic prevention and the ability to sustain this function over time were evaluated as a first step by utilizing a NaCl solution. The primers consisted of epoxy resins embedded with either (1) Mg flake pigments (MgRP) or (2) Mg flake pigments and spherical Al-5 wt.% Zn together as a composite (MgAlRP). MgRP was an effective coating for cathodic protection but dispensed less anodic charge than the composite MgAlRP. Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that some Mg flakes dissolved while uniform surface oxidation occurred on the remaining Mg flakes which led to impaired activation. The composite MgAlRP maintained a suitably negative OCP over time, remained activated, dispensed high anodic charge, and remained an anode in zero resistance ammeter testing. Chemical stability modeling and zero resistance ammeter testing suggest that Mg corrosion elevates the pH which dissolved aluminum oxides and hydroxide thereby activates the Al-5wt.% Zn pigments, thereby providing a primary (i.e. Mg corrosion) and secondary process to enable superior (activation of Al-5wt%Zn) sacrificial anode-based cathodic protection."

The metastable near-infrared helium triplet at 1083.3 nm (HeI) is a powerful proxy of extended and evaporating atmospheres. We used the GIARPS (GIANO-B+HARPS-N) observing mode of the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo to search for HeI absorption in the upper atmosphere of five close-in giant planets hosted by the K and M dwarf stars of our sample, namely WASP-69b, WASP-107b, HAT-P-11b, GJ436b, and GJ3470b. We focused our analysis on the HeI triplet by performing high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. When nightly variability in the HeI absorption signal was identified, we investigated the potential influence of stellar magnetic activity by searching for variations in the H$α$. We spectrally resolve the HeI triplet and confirm the published detections for WASP-69b (3.91$\pm$0.22%, 17.6$σ$), WASP-107b (8.17$^{+0.80}_{-0.76}$%, 10.5$σ$), HAT-P-11b (1.36$\pm$0.17%, 8.0$σ$), and GJ3470b (1.75$^{+0.39}_{-0.36}$%, 4.7$σ$). We do not find evidence of extra absorption for GJ436b. We observe night-to-night variations in the HeI absorption signal for WASP-69b, associated with variability in H$α$, which likely indicates the influence of stellar activity. Additionally, we find that the HeI signal of GJ3470b originates from a single transit, thereby corroborating the discrepancies in the existing literature. An inspection of the H$α$ reveals an absorption signal during the same transit. By combining our findings with previous analyses of GIANO-B HeI measurements of planets around K dwarfs, we explore potential trends with planetary/stellar parameters that are thought to affect the HeI absorption. Our analysis is unable to identify clear patterns, emphasising the need for further measurements and the exploration of additional potential parameters that might influence HeI absorption."

At each stage, the players manage multiple commanders who order military actions on objectives that have an open line of control. When a battle over the control of an objective occurs, its stochastic outcome depends on the actions and the enabling support provided by the control of other objectives. Each player aims to maximize the cumulative number of objectives they control, weighted by their criticality. To solve this large-scale stochastic game, we derive properties of its Markov perfect equilibria by leveraging the logistics and military operational command and control structure. We show the consequential isotonicity of the optimal value function with respect to the partially ordered state space, which in turn leads to a significant reduction of the state and action spaces. We also accelerate Shapley's value iteration algorithm by eliminating dominated actions and investigating pure equilibria of the matrix game solved at each iteration. We demonstrate the computational value of our equilibrium results on a case study that reflects representative operational-level military campaigns with geopolitical implications. Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between the game's parameters and dynamics in equilibrium, resulting in new military insights for campaign analysts."

Therefore, it is crucial to effectively and efficiently deploy CNNs on devices with different computing capabilities to support computer-aided diagnosis. Many methods employ factorized convolutional layers to alleviate the burden of limited computational resources at the expense of expressiveness. To this end, given weak medical image-driven CNN model optimization, a Singular value equalization generalizer-induced Factorized Convolution (SFConv) is proposed to improve the expressive power of factorized convolutions in MIP models. We first decompose the weight matrix of convolutional filters into two low-rank matrices to achieve model reduction. Then minimize the KL divergence between the two low-rank weight matrices and the uniform distribution, thereby reducing the number of singular value directions with significant variance. Extensive experiments on fundus and OCTA datasets demonstrate that our SFConv yields competitive expressiveness over vanilla convolutions while reducing complexity."

Within ISAC emerging application scenarios, vehicular ISAC technologies have the potential to enhance traffic efficiency and safety through integration of communication and synchronized perception abilities. To establish a foundational theoretical support for vehicular ISAC system design and standardization, it is necessary to conduct channel measurements, and modeling to obtain a deep understanding of the radio propagation. In this paper, a dynamic statistical channel model is proposed for vehicular ISAC scenarios, incorporating Sensing Multipath Components (S-MPCs) and Clutter Multipath Components (C-MPCs), which are identified by the proposed tracking algorithm. Based on actual vehicular ISAC channel measurements at 28 GHz, time-varying sensing characteristics in front, left, and right directions are investigated. To model the dynamic evolution process of channel, number of new S-MPCs, lifetimes, initial power and delay positions, dynamic variations within their lifetimes, clustering, power decay, and fading of C-MPCs are statistically characterized. Finally, the paper provides implementation of dynamic vehicular ISAC model and validates it by comparing key simulation statistics between measurements and simulations."

However, the adoption of these videos in streaming encounters challenges related to bandwidth and latency, particularly in mobility conditions such as with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Adaptive resolution and compression aim to preserve quality while maintaining low latency under these constraints, yet downscaling and encoding can still degrade quality and introduce artifacts. Machine learning (ML)-based super-resolution (SR) and quality enhancement techniques offer a promising solution by enhancing detail recovery and reducing compression artifacts. However, current publicly available 360-degree video SR datasets lack compression artifacts, which limit research in this field. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces omnidirectional video streaming dataset (ODVista), which comprises 200 high-resolution and high quality videos downscaled and encoded at four bitrate ranges using the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC)/H.265 standard. Evaluations show that the dataset not only features a wide variety of scenes but also spans different levels of content complexity, which is crucial for robust solutions that perform well in real-world scenarios and generalize across diverse visual environments.

To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or Néel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous MPI sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction."

Then, we consider the other version, where the houses have capacities. We study how to optimally increase the capacities of the houses to obtain a matching satisfying multiple optimality criteria, like popularity, Pareto-optimality and perfectness. We consider two common optimality criteria, one aiming to minimize the sum of capacity increases of all houses and the other aiming to minimize the maximum capacity increase of any school. We obtain a complete picture in terms of computational complexity and some algorithms."

We establish a quantum phase diagram where conventional phases, including dimer singlet, plaquette singlet, N{\' e}el and collinear phase, can be clearly identified by suitable local order parameters. Among them a $SU(2)_1$ chiral spin liquid emerges in the highly frustrated region, which is unambiguously identified by two topologically degenerate ground states, modular matrix, and characteristic level counting in entanglement spectrum, featuring the same topological order of $ν=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state. The phase boundaries among the different orders are determined by the energy level crossing analysis and wave function fidelity susceptibility."

The proposed nonlinear SPE incorporates the two-component wave function and the imaginary diffusion. Consequently, classical fluid flow can be interpreted as a non-Hermitian quantum spin system. Using the SPE-based numerical simulation of viscous flows, we demonstrate the quantum/wave-like behavior in flow dynamics. Furthermore, the SPE equivalent to the NSE can facilitate the quantum simulation of fluid dynamics."

If additionally, the set of vertices induces a connected subgraph of $G$ then the set is a connected dominating set of $G$. The domination number $γ(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a dominating set of $G$, and the connected domination number $γ_c(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a connected dominating set of $G$. We find the connected domination numbers for all triangulations of up to thirteen vertices. For $n\ge 15$, $n\equiv 0$ (mod 3), we find graphs of order $n$ and $γ_c=\frac{n}{3}$. We also show that the difference $γ_c(G)-γ(G)$ can be arbitrarily large."

Cañizo', 'Alejandro Ramos-Lora']","We consider minimizers of the N-particle interaction potential energy and briefly review numerical methods used to calculate them. We consider simple pair potentials which are attractive at short distances and repulsive at long distances, focusing on examples which are sums of two powers. The range of powers we look at includes the well-known case of the Lennard-Jones potential, but we are also interested in less singular potentials which are relevant in collective behavior models. We report on results using the software GMIN developed by Wales and collaborators for problems in chemistry. For all cases, this algorithm gives good candidates for the minimizers for relatively low values of the particle number N. This is well-known for potentials similar to Lennard-Jones, but not for the range which is of interest in collective behavior. Standard minimization procedures have been used in the literature in this range, but they are likely to yield stationary states which are not minimizers. We illustrate numerically some properties of the minimizers in 2D, such as lattice structure, Wulff shapes, and the continuous large-N limit for locally integrable (that is, less singular) potentials."

We have identified different realizations of the $S_3$ modular symmetry, referred to as models A, B, C, and D. The 4 models are compatible with neutrino mass being inverted ordering (IO). Moreover, models A, B, and D can also accommodate normal ordering (NO) neutrino masses. We identify parameter space for each model compatible with neutrino oscillation at the 2-$σ$ level. We then proceed to study the neutrino phenomenology of each model. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be as light as 0.64 meV in the case of NO in model A and 50 meV in the case of IO in model D. The smallest effective electron neutrino mass attainable in our analysis is 8.8 meV in the case of NO (model A), and 50 meV for IO (model D). Finally, we note that the effective Majorana mass can be as small as 0.33 meV in the case of NO (model A) and 22 meV for IO (model D)."

The former arises from non-uniform point sampling, allowing models to distinguish the density disparities between foreground and background for easier segmentation. The latter results from sampling only 2,048 points, limiting semantic information and deviating from the real-world practice. To address these issues, we introduce a standardized FS-PCS setting, upon which a new benchmark is built. Moreover, we propose a novel FS-PCS model. While previous methods are based on feature optimization by mainly refining support features to enhance prototypes, our method is based on correlation optimization, referred to as Correlation Optimization Segmentation (COSeg). Specifically, we compute Class-specific Multi-prototypical Correlation (CMC) for each query point, representing its correlations to category prototypes. Then, we propose the Hyper Correlation Augmentation (HCA) module to enhance CMC. Furthermore, tackling the inherent property of few-shot training to incur base susceptibility for models, we propose to learn non-parametric prototypes for the base classes during training. The learned base prototypes are used to calibrate correlations for the background class through a Base Prototypes Calibration (BPC) module. Experiments on popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of COSeg over existing methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhaochongAn/COSeg"

To satisfy the practical necessity, the incremental learning ability of the detector becomes a critical factor for real-world applications. Unfortunately, neural networks unavoidably meet catastrophic forgetting problem when it is implemented on a new task. To this end, many incremental object detection models preserve the knowledge of previous tasks by replaying samples or distillation from previous models. However, they ignore an important factor that the performance of the model mostly depends on its feature. These models try to rouse the memory of the neural network with previous samples but not to prevent forgetting. To this end, in this paper, we propose an incremental causal object detection (ICOD) model by learning causal features, which can adapt to more tasks. Traditional object detection models, unavoidably depend on the data-bias or data-specific features to get the detection results, which can not adapt to the new task. When the model meets the requirements of incremental learning, the data-bias information is not beneficial to the new task, and the incremental learning may eliminate these features and lead to forgetting. To this end, our ICOD is introduced to learn the causal features, rather than the data-bias features when training the detector. Thus, when the model is implemented to a new task, the causal features of the old task can aid the incremental learning process to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. We conduct our model on several experiments, which shows a causal feature without data-bias can make the model adapt to new tasks better. \keywords{Object detection, incremental learning, causal feature."

This is done following two methods: by solving the exact characteristic equation and, on the other hand, by solving the nonlinear equations that result for a variable refractive index in the asymptotic approximations. Similar results with both methods are obtained with differences below $1\%$ . Nevertheless, important differences are found with respect to the resonant wavelengths computed with a constant index and with a variable index. We compute the free spectral range and the quality factor, and make a comparison between the variable index and the constant index cases. The differences are of significant relevance for the free spectral range, while for the quality factor, the constant case is insensitive to the chromatic dispersion. Our work could be useful as a pathway for designing microspheres for different applications."

It may happen that $d < e = e(S)$ where $S$ is the semigroup of the curve in $d$-space.

We hypothesize that this is because explicit spatial relations rarely appear in the image captions used to train these models. We propose an automatic method that, given existing images, generates synthetic captions that contain 14 explicit spatial relations. We introduce the Spatial Relation for Generation (SR4G) dataset, which contains 9.9 millions image-caption pairs for training, and more than 60 thousand captions for evaluation. In order to test generalization we also provide an 'unseen' split, where the set of objects in the train and test captions are disjoint. SR4G is the first dataset that can be used to spatially fine-tune text-to-image systems. We show that fine-tuning two different Stable Diffusion models (denoted as SD$_{SR4G}$) yields up to 9 points improvements in the VISOR metric. The improvement holds in the 'unseen' split, showing that SD$_{SR4G}$ is able to generalize to unseen objects. SD$_{SR4G}$ improves the state-of-the-art with fewer parameters, and avoids complex architectures. Our analysis shows that improvement is consistent for all relations. The dataset and the code will be publicly available."

Elastic computing allows virtual machines (i.e., computing nodes) to be preempted when high-priority jobs arise, and also allows new virtual machines to participate in the computation. In 2018, Yang et al. introduced Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) to address the elasticity using coding technology, with lower storage and computation load requirements. However, CSEC is limited to certain types of computations (e.g., linear) due to the coded data storage based on linear coding. Then Centralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (CUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds was proposed, which directly copies parts of data into the virtual machines. In all existing works in elastic computing, the storage assignment is centralized, meaning that the number and identity of all virtual machines possible used in the whole computation process are known during the storage assignment. In this paper, we consider Decentralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (DUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds, where any available virtual machine can join the computation which is not predicted and thus coordination among different virtual machines' storage assignments is not allowed. Under a decentralized storage assignment originally proposed in coded caching by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we propose a computing scheme with closed-form optimal computation time. We also run experiments over MNIST dataset with Softmax regression model through the Tencent cloud platform, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DUSEC system approaches the state-of-art best storage assignment in the CUSEC system in computation time."

Our approach employs a two-stage methodology combining representation learning and transfer learning. The representation learning model uses an autoencoder that compresses various user features into a representation space. In the second stage, downstream task-specific models leverage user representations via transfer learning instead of curating user features individually. We further augment this methodology on the representation's input features to increase flexibility and enable reaction to user events, including new user experiences, in Near-Real Time. Additionally, we propose a novel solution to manage deployment of this framework in production models, allowing downstream models to work independently. We validate the performance of our framework through rigorous offline and online experiments within a large-scale system, showcasing its remarkable efficacy across multiple evaluation tasks. Finally, we show how the proposed framework can significantly reduce infrastructure costs compared to alternative approaches."

These lobes, encompassing active (primary) and passive (secondary) phases, exhibit a diverse range of properties across the multiple frequency bands, posing challenges in discerning their formation mechanism. The proposed mechanisms can broadly be categorized into those related either to a triaxial ambient medium, into which the jet propagates, or to a complex, central AGN mechanism, where the jet is generated. The observed characteristics of XRGs as discovered in the most substantial sample to date, challenge the idea that there is universal process at work that produces the individual sources of XRGs. Instead, the observational and numerical results rather imply the absence of an universal model and infer that distinct mechanisms may be at play for the specific sources. By scrutinizing salient and confounding properties, this review intends to propose the potential direction for future research to constrain and constrict individual models applicable to XRGs."

Each block comprises three key components: (1) QKV generation, (2) multi-head attention, and (3) feed-forward networks. In batched processing, QKV generation and feed-forward networks involve compute-intensive matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM), while multi-head attention requires bandwidth-heavy matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV). Machine learning accelerators like TPUs or NPUs are proficient in handling GEMM but are less efficient for GEMV computations. Conversely, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) technology is tailored for efficient GEMV computation, while it lacks the computational power to effectively handle GEMM. Inspired by this insight, we propose NeuPIMs, a heterogeneous accelerator-based system that jointly exploits a conventional GEMM-focused NPU and GEMV-optimized PIM devices. The main challenge in efficiently integrating NPU and PIM lies in enabling concurrent operations on both platforms, each addressing a specific kernel type. First, existing PIMs typically operate in a ""blocked"" mode, allowing only either NPU or PIM to be active at any given time. Second, the inherent dependencies between GEMM and GEMV in LLMs restrict their parallel processing. To tackle these challenges, NeuPIMs is equipped with dual row buffers in each bank, facilitating the simultaneous management of memory read/write operations and PIM commands. Further, NeuPIMs employs a runtime sub-batch interleaving technique to maximize concurrent execution, leveraging batch parallelism to allow two independent sub-batches to be pipelined within a single NeuPIMs node. Our evaluation demonstrates that compared to an NPU-only approach and a naïve NPU-PIM integrated system, NeuPIMs achieves 2.3$\times$ and 1.6$\times$ throughput improvement, respectively."

Whereas the time-independent approach of computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we apply Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. Under an at most quadratic potential, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and can be propagated using the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. Here, we use two-dimensional global harmonic models to validate the method by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations and to demonstrate the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Additionally, we show the practicality of the Hagedorn approach in a high-dimensional system on a displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom."

By considering a class of windows for the polarised Cohen's class that is smaller than the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, then we find spaces of modulation spaces of operators, and we consider the properties of these spaces, including discretisation results and mapping properties between function modulation spaces. We also compare modulation spaces of operators to known symbol classes for pseudodifferential operators.

In particular, we do not understand well whether enhanced optimization translates to improved generalizability. Current research overlooks the inherent stochastic nature of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, resulting in a lack of comprehensive benchmarking and insight into their statistical performance. This paper aims to address this gap by adopting a novel approach. Rather than solely evaluating the endpoint of individual optimization trajectories, we draw from an ensemble of trajectories to estimate the stationary distribution of stochastic optimizers. Our investigation encompasses a wide array of techniques, including SGD and its variants, flat-minima optimizers, and new algorithms we propose under the Basin Hopping framework. Through our evaluation, which encompasses synthetic functions with known minima and real-world problems in computer vision and natural language processing, we emphasize fair benchmarking under a statistical framework, comparing stationary distributions and establishing statistical significance. Our study uncovers several key findings regarding the relationship between training loss and hold-out accuracy, as well as the comparable performance of SGD, noise-enabled variants, and novel optimizers utilizing the BH framework. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate performance on par with flat-minima optimizers like SAM, albeit with half the gradient evaluations. We anticipate that our work will catalyze further exploration in deep learning optimization, encouraging a shift away from single-model approaches towards methodologies that acknowledge and leverage the stochastic nature of optimizers."

The one-day bin $γ$-ray light curve exhibits multiple substructures with asymmetric and symmetric profiles. Notably, the $γ$-ray light curve shows a maximum flux of $\rm 3.63 \times 10^{-6}\, ph \,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ on MJD\,59954.50, which is the highest flux ever observed from this source. The correlation between the $γ$-ray flux and $γ$-ray spectral indices suggests a moderate harder when the brighter trend. Taking $γ$-ray light curve as the reference, a strong correlation is observed with X-ray, optical, and UV energies. Additionally, the $γ$-rays and optical/UV emissions exhibit higher variability compared to X-rays. To understand the parameter variation during the active state of the source, we conducted a statistical broadband spectral modelling of the source in 10 flux intervals of equal duration. A one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton processes successfully reproduces the broadband SED in each of these flux intervals. We observed that the flux variation during the active state is mainly associated with the variation in the magnetic field and the particle spectral indices."

Therefore, a simulation of the deformation of a large aerogel structure resolving the nanostructure would be extremely expensive. Thus, multi-scale or homogenization approaches have to be considered. Here, a computational scale bridging approach based on the FE$^2$ method is suggested, where the macroscopic scale is discretized using finite elements while the microstructure of the open-porous material is resolved as a network of Euler-Bernoulli beams. Here, the beam frame based RVEs (representative volume elements) have pores whose size distribution follows the measured values for a specific material. This is a well-known approach to model aerogel structures. For the computational homogenization, an approach to average the first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses in a beam frame by neglecting rotational moments is suggested. To further overcome the computationally most expensive part in the homogenization method, that is, solving the RVEs and averaging their stress fields, a surrogate model is introduced based on neural networks. The networks input is the localized deformation gradient on the macroscopic scale and its output is the averaged stress for the specific material. It is trained on data generated by the beam frame based approach. The effiency and robustness of both homogenization approaches is shown numerically, the approximation properties of the surrogate model is verified for different macroscopic problems and discretizations.

We elucidate how individual components regarding image clustering impact image synthesis across three datasets. By combining recent advancements from image clustering and diffusion models, we show that, given the optimal cluster granularity with respect to image synthesis (visual groups), cluster-conditioning can achieve state-of-the-art FID (i.e. 1.67, 2.17 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively), while attaining a strong training sample efficiency. Finally, we propose a novel method to derive an upper cluster bound that reduces the search space of the visual groups using solely feature-based clustering. Unlike existing approaches, we find no significant connection between clustering and cluster-conditional image generation. The code and cluster assignments will be released."

Inspired by these, we aim to provide a new paradigm on wireless channel from semantic level. A channel semantic model and its characterization framework are proposed in this paper. Specifically, a channel semantic model composes of status semantics, behavior semantics and event semantics. Based on actual channel measurement at 28 GHz, as well as multi-mode data, example results of channel semantic characterization are provided and analyzed, which exhibits reasonable and interpretable semantic information."

In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for user localization in a network with an HRIS. The protocol includes two steps. In the first step, the HRIS operates in full absorption mode and the user equipment (UE) transmits a signal that is locally processed at the HRIS to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA). In the second step, the base station transmits a downlink reference signal to the UE, and the HRIS superimposes a message by a backscatter modulation. The message contains information on the previously estimated AoA. Lastly, the UE, knowing the position of the HRIS, estimates the time of flight (ToF) from the signal of the second step and demodulates the information on the AoA to obtain an estimate of its location. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution, also in comparison with the Cramér Rao lower bound on the estimated quantities.nd on the estimated quantities."

CDFSL faces challenges in transferring knowledge across dissimilar domains and fine-tuning models with limited training data. To address these challenges, we initially extend the analysis of loss landscapes from the parameter space to the representation space, which allows us to simultaneously interpret the transferring and fine-tuning difficulties of CDFSL models. We observe that sharp minima in the loss landscapes of the representation space result in representations that are hard to transfer and fine-tune. Moreover, existing flatness-based methods have limited generalization ability due to their short-range flatness. To enhance the transferability and facilitate fine-tuning, we introduce a simple yet effective approach to achieve long-range flattening of the minima in the loss landscape. This approach considers representations that are differently normalized as minima in the loss landscape and flattens the high-loss region in the middle by randomly sampling interpolated representations. We implement this method as a new normalization layer that replaces the original one in both CNNs and ViTs. This layer is simple and lightweight, introducing only a minimal number of additional parameters. Experimental results on 8 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average accuracy. Moreover, our method achieves performance improvements of up to 9\% compared to the current best approaches on individual datasets. Our code will be released."

Developers of tools for performing high-throughput phenotyping are, however, constrained by the availability of relevant datasets on which to perform validation. To this end, we present a spatio-temporal dataset of 3D point clouds of strawberry plants for two varieties, totalling 84 individual point clouds. We focus on the end use of such tools - the extraction of biologically relevant phenotypes - and demonstrate a phenotyping pipeline on the dataset. This comprises of the steps, including; segmentation, skeletonisation and tracking, and we detail how each stage facilitates the extraction of different phenotypes or provision of data insights. We particularly note that assessment is focused on the validation of phenotypes, extracted from the representations acquired at each step of the pipeline, rather than singularly focusing on assessing the representation itself. Therefore, where possible, we provide \textit{in silico} ground truth baselines for the phenotypes extracted at each step and introduce methodology for the quantitative assessment of skeletonisation and the length trait extracted thereof. This dataset contributes to the corpus of freely available agricultural/horticultural spatio-temporal data for the development of next-generation phenotyping tools, increasing the number of plant varieties available for research in this field and providing a basis for genuine comparison of new phenotyping methodology."

However, their increased prevalence raises safety concerns -- how can we protect restricted airspace? Knowing the type of unmanned aerial vehicle can go a long way in determining any potential risks it carries. For instance, fixed-wing craft can carry more weight over longer distances, thus potentially posing a more significant threat. This paper presents a machine learning model for classifying unmanned aerial vehicles as quadrotor, hexarotor, or fixed-wing. Our approach effectively applies a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for the purpose of time series classification. We performed experiments to test the effects of changing the timestamp sampling method and addressing the imbalance in the class distribution. Through these experiments, we identified the top-performing sampling and class imbalance fixing methods. Averaging the macro f-scores across 10 folds of data, we found that the majority quadrotor class was predicted well (98.16%), and, despite an extreme class imbalance, the model could also predicted a majority of fixed-wing flights correctly (73.15%). Hexarotor instances were often misclassified as quadrotors due to the similarity of multirotors in general (42.15%). However, results remained relatively stable across certain methods, which prompted us to analyze and report on their tradeoffs. The supplemental material for this paper, including the code and data for running all the experiments and generating the results tables, is available at https://osf.io/mnsgk/."

Recent developments in neural network-based embedded feature selection show promising results across a wide range of applications. Concrete Autoencoders (CAEs), considered state-of-the-art in embedded feature selection, may struggle to achieve stable joint optimization, hurting their training time and generalization. In this work, we identify that this instability is correlated with the CAE learning duplicate selections. To remedy this, we propose a simple and effective improvement: Indirectly Parameterized CAEs (IP-CAEs). IP-CAEs learn an embedding and a mapping from it to the Gumbel-Softmax distributions' parameters. Despite being simple to implement, IP-CAE exhibits significant and consistent improvements over CAE in both generalization and training time across several datasets for reconstruction and classification. Unlike CAE, IP-CAE effectively leverages non-linear relationships and does not require retraining the jointly optimized decoder. Furthermore, our approach is, in principle, generalizable to Gumbel-Softmax distributions beyond feature selection."

Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension $D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation."

In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for joint estimation of ordinal and nominal attributes based on information sharing. We tackle the correlation problem between heterogeneous attributes using hard parameter sharing of shallow features, and trade-off multiple loss functions by considering homoskedastic uncertainty for each attribute estimation task. This leads to optimal estimation of multiple attributes of the face and reduces the training cost of multitask learning. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state of the art. Finally, we discuss the bias issues arising from the proposed approach in face attribute estimation and validate its feasibility on edge systems."

Using an approach that is traceable to the use of tuned mass absorbers and dampers, widely used in mechanical and civil engineering, resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers can be configured to target specific eigenmodes of a structure, if appropriately placed and tuned. By re-framing the function of resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers as frequency dependent variable stiffness elements, it is of great interest to investigate their capabilities to realize frequency dependent topologies (in the sense of the mechanical connectivity) in the frame of lattice metamaterials, where the load path within a lattice can be interrupted at will for specific frequencies by intercalating null-stiffness components realized with resonantly shunted piezoelectrics. Here, we offer the numerical and experimental verification of this idea, using the example of a potential unit cell of such an adaptive lattice metamaterial. Its realization as additively manufactured component points to the feasibility of such metamaterials in real life."

However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data.

A two-layer collision avoidance framework that considers inland waterway traffic regulations is proposed to increase navigational safety for autonomous ships. Our approach allows for modifying traffic rules without changing the collision avoidance algorithm, and is based on a novel formulation of model predictive control (MPC) for collision avoidance of ships. This MPC formulation is designed for inland waterway traffic and can handle complex scenarios. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used as a scheme for exchanging and negotiating intentions among ships. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can comply with traffic rules.

We find that computationally efficient compression algorithms capture information similar to what is measured by slow to compute $n$-gram overlap homogeneity scores. Further, a combination of measures -- compression ratios, self-repetition of long $n$-grams and Self-BLEU and BERTScore -- are sufficient to report, as they have low mutual correlation with each other. The applicability of scores extends beyond analysis of generative models; for example, we highlight applications on instruction-tuning datasets and human-produced texts.

We also identify other asteroid encounters that deserve monitoring."

While it prioritizes exploration by randomly generating and maximizing sample paths of Gaussian process (GP) posteriors, TS weakly manages its exploitation by gathering information about the true objective function after each exploration is performed. In this study, we incorporate the epsilon-greedy ($\varepsilon$-greedy) policy, a well-established selection strategy in reinforcement learning, into TS to improve its exploitation. We first delineate two extremes of TS applied for BO, namely the generic TS and a sample-average TS. The former and latter promote exploration and exploitation, respectively. We then use $\varepsilon$-greedy policy to randomly switch between the two extremes. A small value of $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ prioritizes exploitation, and vice versa. We empirically show that $\varepsilon$-greedy TS with an appropriate $\varepsilon$ is better than one of its two extremes and competes with the other."

Python's dynamic nature and extensive usage make it an attractive candidate for dynamic program analysis. However, unlike for other popular languages, there currently is no comprehensive benchmark suite of executable Python projects, which hinders the development of dynamic analyses. This work addresses this gap by presenting DyPyBench, the first benchmark of Python projects that is large scale, diverse, ready to run (i.e., with fully configured and prepared test suites), and ready to analyze (by integrating with the DynaPyt dynamic analysis framework). The benchmark encompasses 50 popular opensource projects from various application domains, with a total of 681k lines of Python code, and 30k test cases. DyPyBench enables various applications in testing and dynamic analysis, of which we explore three in this work: (i) Gathering dynamic call graphs and empirically comparing them to statically computed call graphs, which exposes and quantifies limitations of existing call graph construction techniques for Python. (ii) Using DyPyBench to build a training data set for LExecutor, a neural model that learns to predict values that otherwise would be missing at runtime. (iii) Using dynamically gathered execution traces to mine API usage specifications, which establishes a baseline for future work on specification mining for Python. We envision DyPyBench to provide a basis for other dynamic analyses and for studying the runtime behavior of Python code."

An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings.Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of topological edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the topological edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations."

It consists of three components: a newly-proposed pre-processor, a physics-based camera inverter to undo the multiplexing of lensless imaging, and a post-processor. The pre- and post-processors address noise and artifacts unique to lensless imaging before and after camera inversion respectively. By training the three components end-to-end, we obtain a 1.9 dB increase in PSNR and a 14% relative improvement in a perceptual image metric (LPIPS) with respect to previously proposed physics-based methods. We also demonstrate how the proposed pre-processor provides more robustness to input noise, and how an auxiliary loss can improve interpretability."

We are given a set of weighted d-dimensional geometric items like squares, rectangles, or hypercubes and a knapsack which is a square or a (hyper-)cube. We want to select a subset of items that fit non-overlappingly inside the knapsack, maximizing the total profit of the packed items.

In addition, maps were obtained in the period 1990-1992 of U Her with the Very Large Array. We find that the strongest emission in U Her is located in a shell with boundaries 11-25 AU. The gas crossing time is 8.5 years. We derive lifetimes for individual maser clouds of less than 4 years, based on the absence of detectable line-of-sight velocity drifts of the maser emission. The shell is not evenly filled, and its structure is maintained on timescales much longer than those of individual maser clouds."

So far, such reconstruction methods for 1-RDM, not constrained to idempotency, had been tested only on a toy model system (CO$_2$). In this work, a new method is assessed on crystalline urea (CO(NH$_2$)$_2$) using static (0 K) and dynamic (50 K) artificial-experimental data. An improved model, including symmetry constraints and frozen-core electron contribution, is introduced to better handle the increasing system complexity. Reconstructed 1-RDMs, deformation densities and DCP anisotropy are analyzed, and it is demonstrated that the changes in the model significantly improve the reconstruction's quality against insufficient information and data corruption. The robustness of the model and the strategy are thus shown to be well-adapted to address the reconstruction problem from actual experimental scattering data."

We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe."

An analogy with classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is proposed to present the main results used in this field. Emphasis is placed on the different numerical algorithms to solve a quantum optimal control problem. Several examples ranging from the control of two-level quantum systems to that of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice are studied in detail, using both analytical and numerical methods. Codes based on shooting method and gradient-based algorithms are provided. The connection between optimal processes and the quantum speed limit is also discussed in two-level quantum systems. In the case of BEC, the experimental implementation of optimal control protocols is described, both for two-level and many-level cases, with the current constraints and limitations of such platforms.

This has the potential to explain the observed kinematics of the galaxies, including the missing-mass problem. We, for the first time, based on the galaxy morphological types, investigate the dynamics of a diverse collection of galaxies present in the Spitzer Photometry for Accurate Rotation Curve (SPARC) catalog. We phenomenologically constrain the RGGR model parameter $\left(\barν\right)$ along with the mass-to-light ratio for a sample of 100 SPARC galaxies, selected from four different morphological types, viz. early, spiral, late, and starburst. Our statistical analysis finds RGGR to fit the observed galaxy kinematics consistently. The constrained RGGR model parameter also supports the claim that it has a near-linear dependence on the galactic baryonic mass. From our morphology study, we find that the parameter $\barν$ decreases from the early-type to the starburst galaxies. Finally, the renormalization group improved gravity is tested against the two established empirical relations for the SPARC catalog, viz., the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR), both are found to be satisfied consistently."

Our Coulomb-interaction renormalized band structures feature electron-hole asymmetry, band flatness, band gap, and anti-ferromagnetic ground states in excellent agreement with available experiments for $n \geq 4$.

Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the mainstream of speech synthesis models still relies on supervised speaker modeling and explicit reference utterances. However, there are many aspects of human voice, such as emotion, intonation, and speaking style, for which it is hard to obtain accurate labels. In this paper, we propose VoxGenesis, a novel unsupervised speech synthesis framework that can discover a latent speaker manifold and meaningful voice editing directions without supervision. VoxGenesis is conceptually simple. Instead of mapping speech features to waveforms deterministically, VoxGenesis transforms a Gaussian distribution into speech distributions conditioned and aligned by semantic tokens. This forces the model to learn a speaker distribution disentangled from the semantic content. During the inference, sampling from the Gaussian distribution enables the creation of novel speakers with distinct characteristics. More importantly, the exploration of latent space uncovers human-interpretable directions associated with specific speaker characteristics such as gender attributes, pitch, tone, and emotion, allowing for voice editing by manipulating the latent codes along these identified directions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed VoxGenesis using both subjective and objective metrics, finding that it produces significantly more diverse and realistic speakers with distinct characteristics than the previous approaches. We also show that latent space manipulation produces consistent and human-identifiable effects that are not detrimental to the speech quality, which was not possible with previous approaches. Audio samples of VoxGenesis can be found at: \url{https://bit.ly/VoxGenesis}."

Research has broken down the rather vague notion of data quality into various dimensions, such as accuracy, consistency, and reputation, to name but a few. To achieve the goal of high data quality, many tools and techniques exist to clean and otherwise improve data. Yet, systematic research on actually assessing data quality in all of its dimensions is largely absent, and with it the ability to gauge the success of any data cleaning effort. It is our vision to establish a systematic and comprehensive framework for the (numeric) assessment of data quality for a given dataset and its intended use. Such a framework must cover the various facets that influence data quality, as well as the many types of data quality dimensions. In particular, we identify five facets that serve as a foundation of data quality assessment. For each facet, we outline the challenges and opportunities that arise when trying to actually assign quality scores to data and create a data quality profile for it, along with a wide range of technologies needed for this purpose."

Minority magnons constitute a new type of collective magnetic excitations which increase the magnetic moment rather than lower it, contrary to ordinary (majority) magnons. The presence of such quasi-particles is made possible by the nontrivial ferromagnetic band structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ originating from its nonequivalent Fe sublattices. The result is a strong peak in the dynamic spin-raising susceptibility $χ^{-+}(ω)$ in the long wavelength limit, which is the hallmark of minority magnon physics. We calculate the susceptibility using time-dependent density functional theory and perform a detailed mode analysis, which allows us to separate and investigate the individual magnon modes as well as the Stoner excitations that constitute the many-body spectrum. For minority as well as majority magnons, the analysis reveals a plethora of magnetic excitations, which in addition to the standard main magnon branches include both satellite, valley and spin-inversion magnons, originating from the itinerancy of the ferromagnetic order. The physics underlying this analysis is in no way restricted to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and minority magnons are expected to be observable in many complex ferromagnetic materials."

We experimentally demonstrate the onset of turbulence in the driven condensate as the driving frequency changes and show that it is consistent with the regular-to-chaotic transition of the local spin dynamics. This chaos-assisted turbulence establishes the spin-driven spinor condensate as an intriguing platform for exploring quantum chaos and related superfluid turbulence phenomena."

However, it is often impractical and resource-consuming to study such a vast number of entities. Consequently, entity clustering serves as an initial step in most analytical studies. This process often employs heuristics grounded in the practices and behaviors of these entities. In this research, we delve into the examination of two widely used heuristics, alongside the introduction of four novel ones. Our contribution includes the introduction of the \textit{clustering ratio}, a metric designed to quantify the reduction in the number of entities achieved by a given heuristic. The assessment of this reduction ratio plays an important role in justifying the selection of a specific heuristic for analytical purposes. Given the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin system, characterized by a continuous increase in the number of entities on the blockchain, and the evolving behaviors of these entities, we extend our study to explore the temporal evolution of the clustering ratio for each heuristic. This temporal analysis enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of these heuristics over time."

The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV) center possesses long electron spin lifetimes due to its large spin-orbit splitting. However, the magnetic dipole transitions required for microwave spin control are suppressed, and strain is necessary to enable these transitions. Recent work has shown spin control of strained emitters using microwave lines that suffer from Ohmic losses, restricting coherence through heating. We utilize a superconducting coplanar waveguide to measure SnV centers subjected to strain, observing substantial improvement. A detailed analysis of the SnV center electron spin Hamiltonian based on the angle-dependent splitting of the ground and excited states is performed. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation and obtain a Hahn echo coherence time of up to $T_2 = 430\,μ$s. With dynamical decoupling, we can prolong coherence to $T_2 = 10\,$ms, about six-fold improved compared to earlier works. We also observe a nearby coupling $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ spin which may serve as a quantum memory.

A Cameron-Liebler $k$-set is a collection of $k$-spaces in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ or $\mathrm{AG}(n,q)$ admitting a certain parameter $x$, which is dependent on the size of this collection. One of the main research questions remains the (non-)existence of Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets with parameter $x$. This paper improves two non-existence results. First we show that the parameter of a non-trivial Cameron-Liebler $k$-set in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ should be larger than $q^{n-\frac{5k}{2}-1}$, which is an improvement of an earlier known lower bound. Secondly, we prove a modular equality on the parameter $x$ of Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ with $x<\frac{q^{n-k}-1}{q^{k+1}-1}$, $n\geq 2k+1$, $n-k+1\geq 7$ and $n-k$ even.

Onder']","The electrification of public transport vehicles offers the potential to relieve city centers of pollutant and noise emissions. Furthermore, electric buses have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than diesel buses, particularly when operated with sustainably produced electricity. However, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can consume a significant amount of energy, thus limiting the achievable driving range. In this paper, we address the HVAC system in an electric city bus by analyzing the trade-off between the energy consumption and the thermal comfort of the passengers. We do this by developing a dynamic thermal model for the bus cabin, which we simplify by considering it to be in steady state. We introduce a method that is able to quickly optimize the steady-state HVAC system inputs for a large number of samples representative of a year-round operation. A comparison between the results from the steady-state optimization approach and a dynamic simulation reveal small deviations in both the HVAC system power demand and achieved thermal comfort. Thus, the approximation of the system performance with a steady-state model is justified. We present two case studies to demonstrate the practical relevance of the approach. First, we show how the method can be used to compare different system designs based on a year-round performance evaluation. Second, we show how the method can be used to generate accurate setpoints for online controllers. In conclusion, this study shows that a steady-state analysis of the HVAC systems of an electric city bus is a valuable approach to evaluate and optimize its performance."

However, many of these techniques have been tested in limited settings, often on tasks from single simulation benchmarks and against well-known algorithms rather than a range of regularization approaches. This limits our understanding of the specific mechanisms driving RL improvements. To address this, we implemented over 60 different off-policy agents, each integrating established regularization techniques from recent state-of-the-art algorithms. We tested these agents across 14 diverse tasks from 2 simulation benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while the effectiveness of a specific regularization setup varies with the task, certain combinations consistently demonstrate robust and superior performance.

We compare the present results both with previous analytic results, the results for fixed Mellin moments, and a prediction in the small-$x$ region. We also derive expansions in the region of small and large values of $x$. With this paper, all three-loop single-mass unpolarized and polarized operator matrix elements are calculated."

O Glover', 'Milena Benedettini', 'Juan D. Soler', 'Robin G. Tress', 'Alessio Traficante', 'Patrick Hennebelle', 'Ralf S. Klessen', 'Sergio Molinari', 'Marc-Antoine Miville-Deschênes']","Molecular clouds (MC) are structures of dense gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), that extend from ten to a few hundred parsecs and form the main gas reservoir available for star formation. Hydrodynamical simulations of varying complexity are a promising way to investigate MC evolution and their properties. However, each simulation typically has a limited range in resolution and different cloud extraction algorithms are used, which complicates the comparison between simulations. In this work, we aim to extract clouds from different simulations covering a wide range of spatial scales. We compare their properties, such as size, shape, mass, internal velocity dispersion and virial state. We apply the Hop cloud detection algorithm on (M)HD numerical simulations of stratified ISM boxes and isolated galactic disk simulations that were produced using Flash Ramses and Arepo We find that the extracted clouds are complex in shape ranging from round objects to complex filamentary networks in all setups. Despite the wide range of scales, resolution, and sub-grid physics, we observe surprisingly robust trends in the investigated metrics. The mass spectrum matches in the overlap between simulations without rescaling and with a high-mass slope of $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d}\ln M\propto-1$ in accordance with theoretical predictions. The internal velocity dispersion scales with the size of the cloud as $σ\propto R^{0.75}$ for large clouds ($R\gtrsim3\,\mathrm{pc}$). For small clouds we find larger sigma compared to the power-law scaling, as seen in observations, which is due to supernova-driven turbulence. Almost all clouds are gravitationally unbound with the virial parameter scaling as $α_\mathrm{vir}\propto M^{-0.4}$, which is slightly flatter compared to observed scaling, but in agreement given the large scatter."

Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between models describing existing data with or without the assumption of a QGP. Two models are explored: EPOS4, based on core-corona separation between a QGP phase and a vacuum phase, and PYTHIA 8.3, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings. The observables are based on an event selection requiring the presence of a $φ$ meson. Correlations between the $φ$ and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be an excellent discriminator between the two types of models. These observations emphasize the need for further testing in upcoming LHC Runs, leveraging improved detectors and increased data collection."

Previous works have established metrics for quantifying memorization, explored various influencing factors, such as data duplication, model size, and prompt length, and evaluated memorization by comparing model outputs with training corpora. However, the training corpora are of enormous scale and its pre-processing is time-consuming. To explore memorization without accessing training data, we propose a novel approach, named ROME, wherein memorization is explored by comparing disparities across memorized and non-memorized. Specifically, models firstly categorize the selected samples into memorized and non-memorized groups, and then comparing the demonstrations in the two groups from the insights of text, probability, and hidden state. Experimental findings show the disparities in factors including word length, part-of-speech, word frequency, mean and variance, just to name a few."

Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models. We evaluate the pipeline to demonstrate its superior performance compared with other approaches. The CCR method outperforms word-embedding-based approaches across all of our tasks and exceeds prompting with GPT-4 in most tasks. Finally, we benchmark the pipeline against objective, external data to further verify its validity."

The detection of such changepoints is important for many applications. While this problem has been studied substantially in the linear data setup, not much work has been done for angular data. In this article, we utilize the intrinsic geometry of a torus to introduce the notion of the `square of an angle' and use it to propose a new measure of variation, called the `curved variance', of an angular random variable. Using the above ideas, we propose new tests for the existence of changepoint(s) in the concentration, mean direction, and/or both of these. The limiting distributions of the test statistics are derived and their powers are obtained using extensive simulation. It is seen that the tests have better power than the corresponding existing tests. The proposed methods have been implemented on three real-life data sets revealing interesting insights. In particular, our method when used to detect simultaneous changes in mean direction and concentration for hourly wind direction measurements of the cyclonic storm `Amphan' identified changepoints that could be associated with important meteorological events."

The such analysis, the 3D structure of molecules is a fundamental consideration, involving the manipulation of molecular representations based on their degrees of freedom, including rigid roto-translation and fragment rotations along rotatable bonds, to determine the preferred spatial arrangement when molecules bind to each other. In this paper, quantum annealing based solution to solve Molecular unfolding (MU) problem, a specific phase within molecular docking, is explored and compared with a state-of-the-art classical algorithm named ""GeoDock"". Molecular unfolding focuses on expanding a molecule to an unfolded state to simplify manipulation within the target cavity and optimize its configuration, typically by maximizing molecular area or internal atom distances. Molecular unfolding problem aims to find the torsional configuration that increases the inter-atomic distance within a molecule, which also increases the molecular area. Quantum annealing approach first encodes the problem into a Higher-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) equation which is pruned to an arbitrary percentage to improve the time efficiency and to be able to solve the equation using any quantum annealer. The resultant HUBO is then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization equation (QUBO), which is easily embedded on a D-wave annealing Quantum processor."

To optimize and evaluate ISAC systems and techniques, it is crucial to have an accurate and realistic wireless channel model. However, some important features of ISAC channels have not been well characterized, for example, most existing ISAC channel models consider communication channels and sensing channels independently, whereas ignoring correlation under the consistent environment. Moreover, sensing channels have not been well modeled in the existing standard-level channel models. Therefore, in order to better model ISAC channel, a cluster-based statistical channel model is proposed in this paper, which is based on measurements conducted at 28 GHz. In the proposed model, a new framework based on 3GPP standard is proposed, which includes communication clusters and sensing clusters. Clustering and tracking algorithms are used to extract and analyze ISAC channel characteristics. Furthermore, some special sensing cluster structures such as shared sensing cluster, newborn sensing cluster, etc., are defined to model correlation and difference between communication and sensing channels. Finally, accuracy of the proposed model is validated based on measurements and simulations."

We study the recipe of learning performant IWMs and show that it relies on three key aspects: conditioning, prediction difficulty, and capacity. Additionally, we show that the predictive world model learned by IWM can be adapted through finetuning to solve diverse tasks; a fine-tuned IWM world model matches or surpasses the performance of previous self-supervised methods. Finally, we show that learning with an IWM allows one to control the abstraction level of the learned representations, learning invariant representations such as contrastive methods, or equivariant representations such as masked image modelling."

Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an ""agnostic"" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $ε\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $ε\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$."

The presence of a coherent flow, which is a differential rotation, suppresses small-scale fluctuations of the flow, which are created by an external force, and lead to the fact that these fluctuations can be considered as non-interacting and, therefore, examined in a linear approximation. We calculate the pair correlation function of vorticity and demonstrate that it has a power-law behavior both in space and in time. The obtained results allow us to start a systematic study of the effects associated with the nonlinear interaction of fluctuations, which play an essential role on the periphery of a coherent vortex. Our results are also applicable to the statistics of a passive scalar in a strong shear flow."

Reported RS designs often suffer from insufficient decorrelation between sampling channels, which results in limited compressive sampling efficiency, in essence, due to inadequate engineering of sampling responses. This in turn leads to poor spectral-pixel-to-channel ratios (SPCRs), typically restricted at single digits. So far, there lacks a general guideline for manipulating RS sampling responses for the effectiveness of spectral information acquisition. In this study, we shed light on a fundamental parameter from the compressive sensing theory - the average mutual correlation coefficient v - and provide insight into how it serves as a critical benchmark in RS design with regards to the SPCR and reconstruction accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel RS design with multi-resonant cavities, consisting of a series of partial reflective interfaces. Such multi-cavity configuration offers an expansive parameter space, facilitating the superlative optimization of sampling matrices with minimized v. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a single-shot, dual-band RS is implemented on a SiN platform, tailored for capturing signature spectral shapes across different wavelength regions, with customized photonic crystal nanobeam mirrors. Experimentally, the device demonstrates an overall operation bandwidth of 270 nm and a <0.5 nm resolution with only 15 sampling channels per band, leading to a record high SPCR of 18.0. Moreover, the proposed multi-cavity design can be readily adapted to various photonic platforms. For instance, we showcase that by employing multi-layer coatings, an ultra-broadband RS can be optimized to exhibit a 700 nm bandwidth with an SPCR of over 100."

Conventionally, $α$-TeO2 single crystals were grown using melt methods. Here, we report for the first time the growth of $α$-TeO2 single crystals using the aqueous solution method below 100 °C. Solubility curve of $α$-TeO2 was measured, and then single crystals with dimensions of 3.5x3.5x2.5 mm3 were successfully grown using seed crystals that were synthesized from spontaneous nucleation. The as-grown single crystals belong to the P41212 space group, evidenced by single crystal X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement on powder diffraction.

Time-reversal symmetry breaking often plays an essential role in the emergence and enhancement of nonreciprocal transport. In this paper, we show the nonreciprocal optical responses in noncentrosymmetric superconductors arising from time-reversal symmetry breaking by demonstrating them in $s$-wave superconductors with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field. Numerical results reveal the superconductivity-induced bulk photocurrent and second harmonic generation, which are forbidden at the zero magnetic field. We discuss the properties and mechanisms of the superconducting nonlinear responses emerging under the magnetic field. In particular, we investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the photocurrent conductivity and clarify the essential ingredients which give a contribution unique to superconductors under the magnetic field. This contribution is dominant in the low carrier density regime although the corresponding joint density of states is tiny. We attribute the enhancement to the quantum geometry. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity shows peculiar sign reversal at the transition to the topological superconducting state.

Starting from these summaries, we train deep neural networks (NN) to perform likelihood-free inference of cosmological and PNG parameters. We assess the performance of different subsets of summary statistics; in the case of $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}$, we find that a combination of the power spectrum and a suitable marked power spectrum outperforms the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum, the baseline statistics usually employed in PNG analysis.

However, these methods struggle to simultaneously capture high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth regions due to the fixed receptive field. As a result, they tend to lose details, blur edges, and produce false matches in textureless areas. In this paper, we propose Selective Recurrent Unit (SRU), a novel iterative update operator for stereo matching. The SRU module can adaptively fuse hidden disparity information at multiple frequencies for edge and smooth regions. To perform adaptive fusion, we introduce a new Contextual Spatial Attention (CSA) module to generate attention maps as fusion weights. The SRU empowers the network to aggregate hidden disparity information across multiple frequencies, mitigating the risk of vital hidden disparity information loss during iterative processes. To verify SRU's universality, we apply it to representative iterative stereo matching methods, collectively referred to as Selective-Stereo. Our Selective-Stereo ranks $1^{st}$ on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Middlebury leaderboards among all published methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Windsrain/Selective-Stereo."

Unlike generic graphs, geometric graphs often exhibit physical symmetries of translations, rotations, and reflections, making them ineffectively processed by current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To tackle this issue, researchers proposed a variety of Geometric Graph Neural Networks equipped with invariant/equivariant properties to better characterize the geometry and topology of geometric graphs. Given the current progress in this field, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive survey of data structures, models, and applications related to geometric GNNs. In this paper, based on the necessary but concise mathematical preliminaries, we provide a unified view of existing models from the geometric message passing perspective. Additionally, we summarize the applications as well as the related datasets to facilitate later research for methodology development and experimental evaluation. We also discuss the challenges and future potential directions of Geometric GNNs at the end of this survey."

Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, i.e., represent the given subjects as pseudo-words and then compose them with the given text. However, the inherent entangled influence scope of pseudo-words with the given text results in a dual-optimum paradox, i.e., the similarity of the given subjects and the controllability of the given text could not be optimal simultaneously. We present RealCustom that, for the first time, disentangles similarity from controllability by precisely limiting subject influence to relevant parts only, achieved by gradually narrowing real text word from its general connotation to the specific subject and using its cross-attention to distinguish relevance. Specifically, RealCustom introduces a novel ""train-inference"" decoupled framework: (1) during training, RealCustom learns general alignment between visual conditions to original textual conditions by a novel adaptive scoring module to adaptively modulate influence quantity; (2) during inference, a novel adaptive mask guidance strategy is proposed to iteratively update the influence scope and influence quantity of the given subjects to gradually narrow the generation of the real text word. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior real-time customization ability of RealCustom in the open domain, achieving both unprecedented similarity of the given subjects and controllability of the given text for the first time.

In this paper, an implicit high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) is developed to remove the restrictions on the time step for unsteady simulations. In order to improve the efficiency and keep the high-order accuracy, a two-stage third-order implicit time-accurate discretization is proposed. In each stage, an artificial steady solution is obtained for the implicit system with the pseudo-time iteration. In the iteration, the classical implicit methods are adopted to solve the nonlinear system, including the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) and generalized minimum residual (GMRES) methods. To achieve the spatial accuracy, the HGKSs with both non-compact and compact reconstructions are constructed. For the non-compact scheme, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction is used. For the compact one, the Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction is adopted due to the updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their derivatives. The expected third-order temporal accuracy is achieved with the two-stage temporal discretization. For the smooth flow, only a single artificial iteration is needed. For uniform meshes, the efficiency of the current implicit method improves significantly in comparison with the explicit one. For the flow with discontinuities, compared with the well-known Crank-Nicholson method, the spurious oscillations in the current schemes are well suppressed. The increase of the artificial iteration steps introduces extra reconstructions associating with a reduction of the computational efficiency. Overall, the current implicit method leads to an improvement in efficiency over the explicit one in the cases with a large variation of mesh size."

Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind."

However, existing benchmarks fail to provide a comprehensive feedback on the temporal perception ability of Video LLMs. On the one hand, most of them are unable to distinguish between different temporal aspects (e.g., speed, direction) and thus cannot reflect the nuanced performance on these specific aspects. On the other hand, they are limited in the diversity of task formats (e.g., only multi-choice QA), which hinders the understanding of how temporal perception performance may vary across different types of tasks. Motivated by these two problems, we propose the \textbf{TempCompass} benchmark, which introduces a diversity of temporal aspects and task formats. To collect high-quality test data, we devise two novel strategies: (1) In video collection, we construct conflicting videos that share the same static content but differ in a specific temporal aspect, which prevents Video LLMs from leveraging single-frame bias or language priors. (2) To collect the task instructions, we propose a paradigm where humans first annotate meta-information for a video and then an LLM generates the instruction. We also design an LLM-based approach to automatically and accurately evaluate the responses from Video LLMs. Based on TempCompass, we comprehensively evaluate 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) Video LLMs and 3 Image LLMs, and reveal the discerning fact that these models exhibit notably poor temporal perception ability.

In this research, we collect all the daily data of ETF options traded at Shanghai Stock Exchange and start with a simple short-volatility strategy. The strategy delivers nice performance before 2018, providing significant excess return over the buy and hold benchmark. However, after 2018, this strategy starts to deteriorate and no obvious risk-adjusted return is shown. Based on the discussion of relationship between the strategy's performance and market's volatility, we improve the model by adjusting positions and exposure according to volatility forecasts using methods such as volatility momentum and GARCH. The new models have improved performance in different ways, where larger upside capture and smaller drawbacks can be achieved in market fluctuation. This research has shown potentials of volatility-based trading on Chinese equity index options, and with further improvement and implementation considerations, real-world practical trading strategies can be formed."

If it is useful for the private sector to insure idiosyncratic risk, government debt expansions can increase the natural rate of interest and create inflation. As I demonstrate using a tractable model, this holds in the presence of an active Taylor rule and does not require the absence of future fiscal consolidation. Further analysis using a full-blown 2-asset HANK model reveals the quantitative magnitude of the mechanism to crucially depend on the structure of the asset market: under standard assumptions, the effect of public debt on the natural rate is either overly strong or overly weak. Employing a parsimonious way to overcome this issue, my framework suggests relevant effects of public debt on inflation under active monetary policy: In particular, persistently elevated public debt may make it harder to go the last ""mile of disinflation"" unless central banks explicitly take its effect on the neutral rate into account."

We train a manipulator to autonomously study objects of which it has no prior knowledge, such as planetary rocks. This is achieved using causal machine learning in a simulated planetary environment. Here, the manipulator interacts with objects, and classifies them based on differing causal factors. These are parameters, such as mass or friction coefficient, that causally determine the outcomes of its interactions. Through reinforcement learning, the manipulator learns to interact in ways that reveal the underlying causal factors. We show that this method works even without any prior knowledge of the objects, or any previously-collected training data. We carry out the training in planetary exploration conditions, with realistic manipulator models."

However, when these masks contain noise, as a frequent occurrence with non-expert users, the output would include unwanted artifacts. This paper first highlights the crucial role of controlling the impact of these inexplicit masks with diverse deterioration levels through in-depth analysis. Subsequently, to enhance controllability with inexplicit masks, an advanced Shape-aware ControlNet consisting of a deterioration estimator and a shape-prior modulation block is devised. The deterioration estimator assesses the deterioration factor of the provided masks. Then this factor is utilized in the modulation block to adaptively modulate the model's contour-following ability, which helps it dismiss the noise part in the inexplicit masks. Extensive experiments prove its effectiveness in encouraging ControlNet to interpret inaccurate spatial conditions robustly rather than blindly following the given contours. We showcase application scenarios like modifying shape priors and composable shape-controllable generation. Codes are soon available."

Delay-based Arbiter PUFs, with their ease of implementation and vast challenge space, have received significant attention; however, they are not immune to modelling attacks that exploit correlations between their inputs and outputs. Research is therefore polarized between developing modelling-resistant PUFs and devising machine learning attacks against them. This dichotomy often results in exaggerated concerns and overconfidence in PUF security, primarily because there lacks a universal tool to gauge a PUF's security. In many scenarios, attacks require additional information, such as PUF type or configuration parameters. Alarmingly, new PUFs are often branded `secure' if they lack a specific attack model upon introduction. To impartially assess the security of delay-based PUFs, we present a generic framework featuring a Mixture-of-PUF-Experts (MoPE) structure for mounting attacks on various PUFs with minimal adversarial knowledge, which provides a way to compare their performance fairly and impartially. We demonstrate the capability of our model to attack different PUF types, including the first successful attack on Heterogeneous Feed-Forward PUFs using only a reasonable amount of challenges and responses. We propose an extension version of our model, a Multi-gate Mixture-of-PUF-Experts (MMoPE) structure, facilitating multi-task learning across diverse PUFs to recognise commonalities across PUF designs. This allows a streamlining of training periods for attacking multiple PUFs simultaneously. We conclude by showcasing the potent performance of MoPE and MMoPE across a spectrum of PUF types, employing simulated, real-world unbiased, and biased data sets for analysis."

We demonstrate that internal energy $U(S^{*},V,N)$ of such systems in stationary and non-stationary states is the function of only three parameters of state, i.e. non-equilibrium entropy $S^{*}$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ in the system. Upon transition between different states, the system obeys the first thermodynamic law, i.e. $dU=T^{*}dS^{*}-p^{*}dV+μ^{*}dN$, where $U=3/2 NRT^{*}$ and $p^{*}V=NRT^{*}$. Placing a cylinder inside the channel, we find that U depends on the location of the cylinder $y_{c}$ only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(y_{c}),V,N(y_{c}))$ at V=const. Moreover, when the flow around the cylinder becomes unstable, and velocity, pressure, and density start to oscillate as a function of time, t, U depends on t only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(t),V,N(t))$ for V=const. These examples show that such a form of internal energy is robust and does not depend on the particular boundary conditions even in the unsteady flow."

Moreover, creating high quality dialogue data has until now required considerable human input, limiting both the scale of these datasets and the ability to rapidly bootstrap data for a new target domain. We aim to overcome these issues with LUCID, a modularised and highly automated LLM-driven data generation system that produces realistic, diverse and challenging dialogues. We use LUCID to generate a seed dataset of 4,277 multi-domain, multi-intent conversations across 100 intents to demonstrate its capabilities.

To reconstruct meaningful and quantitative images from the measurement intensities, however, it relies on computational phase retrieval which in many cases assumes the phase-shift and attenuation coefficient of the sample to be proportional. Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods. The algorithm shows superior reconstruction quality compared to the established CTF-based method at similar computational cost. Our analysis provides a deeper fundamental understanding of the homogeneous object assumption and the proposed algorithm will help improve the image quality for near-field holography in biomedical applications"

The model, initially introduced by Callegari and Ting (SIAM, J. of App. Math., (1978), vol. 35, pp. 148-175), is based on a matched asymptotic expansion in which the outer solution, given by the Biot-Savart law, is matched with the inner solution derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on recent work by Harikrishnan et al (Phys. of Fluids, (2023), vol. 35) the Boussinesq approximation is applied such that the density variations only enter in the gravity term. However, unlike Harikrishnan et al. (2023) the density variation enters at a lower order in the asymptotic expansion, and thus has a more significant impact on the self-induced velocity of the vortex filament. In this regime, which corresponds to the regime studied by Chang and Smith (J. of Fl. Mech., (2018), vol. 857), the effect of gravity is given by an alteration of the core constant, which couples the motion of the filament to the motion within the vortical core, in addition to a change in the compatability conditions (evolution equations) which determine the leading order azimuthal and tangential velocity fields in the vortex core. The results are used to explain certain properties of bouyant vortex rings, as well as qualitatively explore the impact of gravity on tornado type atmospheric vorticies."

We explore deformation-aware face stylization that diverges from traditional single-image style reference, opting for a real-style image pair instead. The cornerstone of our method is the utilization of a self-supervised vision transformer, specifically DINO-ViT, to establish a robust and consistent facial structure representation across both real and style domains. Our stylization process begins by adapting the StyleGAN generator to be deformation-aware through the integration of spatial transformers (STN). We then introduce two innovative constraints for generator fine-tuning under the guidance of DINO semantics: i) a directional deformation loss that regulates directional vectors in DINO space, and ii) a relative structural consistency constraint based on DINO token self-similarities, ensuring diverse generation. Additionally, style-mixing is employed to align the color generation with the reference, minimizing inconsistent correspondences. This framework delivers enhanced deformability for general one-shot face stylization, achieving notable efficiency with a fine-tuning duration of approximately 10 minutes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art one-shot face stylization methods.

Existing discourse emphasizes EV battery costs as being principally responsible for this price differential and widespread adoption is routinely conditioned upon battery costs declining. We scrutinize such reasoning by sourcing data on EV attributes and market conditions between 2011 and 2023. Our findings are fourfold. First, EV prices are influenced principally by the number of amenities, additional features, and dealer-installed accessories sold as standard on an EV, and to a lesser extent, by EV horsepower. Second, EV range is negatively correlated with EV price implying that range anxiety concerns may be less consequential than existing discourse suggests. Third, battery capacity is positively correlated with EV price, due to more capacity being synonymous with the delivery of more horsepower. Collectively, this suggests that higher procurement prices for EVs reflects consumer preference for vehicles that are feature dense and more powerful. Fourth and finally, accommodating these preferences have produced vehicles with lower fuel economy, a shift that reduces envisioned lifecycle emissions benefits by at least 3.26 percent, subject to the battery pack chemistry leveraged and the carbon intensity of the electrical grid. These findings warrant attention as decarbonization efforts increasingly emphasize electrification as a pathway for complying with domestic and international climate agreements."

Naqvi', 'Maciej Matyka']","We investigate the very onset of the inertial regime in pore-scale fluid flow in a three-dimensional, disordered porous media. We analyze how the flow structure changes with increasing Reynolds number. In particular, we compute tortuosity, spatial kinetic energy localization, and the pore-space volume fraction containing negative streamwise velocity. Our analysis shows that the onset of inertia observed in a standard way by computing the friction factor appears at a Reynolds number two orders of magnitude higher than indicated by analyzing tortuosity and spatial distribution of kinetic energy."

As systems become more interconnected and diverse, system architects are less able to predict and design the interaction between components, deferring the handling of these issues to runtime. One of the important problems that occur during execution is system failures, which increase the need for self-healing systems. The main purpose of self-healing is to have an automatic system that can heal itself without human intervention. This system has predefined actions and procedures that are suitable for recovering the system from different failure modes. In this study, different self-healing methods are categorized and a summary of them is presented."

This paper presents the first comparative analysis of YouTube Shorts versus regular videos with respect to user engagement (i.e., views, likes, and comments), content creation frequency and video categories. We collected a dataset containing information about 70k channels that posted at least one Short, and we analyzed the metadata of all the videos (9.9M Shorts and 6.9M regular videos) they uploaded between January 2021 and December 2022, spanning a two-year period including the introduction of Shorts. Our longitudinal analysis shows that content creators consistently increased the frequency of Shorts production over this period, especially for newly-created channels, which surpassed that of regular videos. We also observe that Shorts target mostly entertainment categories, while regular videos cover a wide variety of categories. In general, Shorts attract more views and likes per view than regular videos, but attract less comments per view. However, Shorts do not outperform regular videos in the education and political categories as much as they do in other categories. Our study contributes to understanding social media dynamics, to quantifying the spread of short-form content, and to motivating future research on its impact on society."

We define fairness through the minimization of the maximum outage probability for the two users, under total resource constraints for both FAS-assisted NOMA and OMA systems. Specifically, in the FAS-assisted NOMA systems, we study both a special case and the general case, deriving a closed-form solution for the former and applying a bisection search method to find the optimal solution for the latter. Moreover, for the general case, we derive a locally optimal closed-form solution to achieve fairness. In the FAS-assisted OMA systems, to deal with the non-convex optimization problem with coupling of the variables in the objective function, we employ an approximation strategy to facilitate a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm, achieving locally optimal solutions for both cases. Empirical analysis validates that our proposed solutions outperform conventional NOMA and OMA benchmarks in terms of fairness."

In this study, we focus on generating medical images with ordinal classes, which have ordinal relationships, such as severity levels. We propose an Ordinal Diffusion Model (ODM) that controls the ordinal relationships of the estimated noise images among the classes. Our model was evaluated experimentally by generating retinal and endoscopic images of multiple severity classes. ODM achieved higher performance than conventional generative models by generating realistic images, especially in high-severity classes with fewer training samples."

In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states."

SNNs are based on a more biologically inspired approach than usual artificial neural networks. Such models are characterized by complex dynamics between neurons and spikes. These are very sensitive to the hyperparameters, making their optimization challenging. To tackle hyperparameter optimization of SNNs, we initially extended the signal loss issue of SNNs to what we call silent networks. These networks fail to emit enough spikes at their outputs due to mistuned hyperparameters or architecture. Generally, search spaces are heavily restrained, sometimes even discretized, to prevent the sampling of such networks. By defining an early stopping criterion detecting silent networks and by designing specific constraints, we were able to instantiate larger and more flexible search spaces. We applied a constrained Bayesian optimization technique, which was asynchronously parallelized, as the evaluation time of a SNN is highly stochastic. Large-scale experiments were carried-out on a multi-GPU Petascale architecture. By leveraging silent networks, results show an acceleration of the search, while maintaining good performances of both the optimization algorithm and the best solution obtained. We were able to apply our methodology to two popular training algorithms, known as spike timing dependent plasticity and surrogate gradient. Early detection allowed us to prevent worthless and costly computation, directing the search toward promising hyperparameter combinations. Our methodology could be applied to multi-objective problems, where the spiking activity is often minimized to reduce the energy consumption. In this scenario, it becomes essential to find the delicate frontier between low-spiking and silent networks. Finally, our approach may have implications for neural architecture search, particularly in defining suitable spiking architectures."

This generalises a well-known property of Hilbert spaces. In the course of proving this, we also obtain a new proof of a result of Stern-van Suijlekom concerning the equivalence between two definitions of trace-class operators on Hilbert modules."

However, the current evaluation of these models for APR tasks focuses solely on the limited context of the single function or file where the bug is located, overlooking the valuable information in the repository-level context. This paper investigates the performance of popular LLMs in handling repository-level repair tasks. We introduce RepoBugs, a new benchmark comprising 124 typical repository-level bugs from open-source repositories. Preliminary experiments using GPT3.5 based on the function where the error is located, reveal that the repair rate on RepoBugs is only 22.58%, significantly diverging from the performance of GPT3.5 on function-level bugs in related studies. This underscores the importance of providing repository-level context when addressing bugs at this level. However, the repository-level context offered by the preliminary method often proves redundant and imprecise and easily exceeds the prompt length limit of LLMs. To solve the problem, we propose a simple and universal repository-level context extraction method (RLCE) designed to provide more precise context for repository-level code repair tasks. Evaluations of three mainstream LLMs show that RLCE significantly enhances the ability to repair repository-level bugs. The improvement reaches a maximum of 160% compared to the preliminary method. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and limitations of RLCE, along with the capacity of LLMs to address repository-level bugs, offering valuable insights for future research."

Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter is taken to infinity. Towards this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. Moreover, they can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly non-convex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability."

However, safe driving of autonomous vehicles remains challenging in complex environments. How to perform safe and appropriate lane change is a popular topic of research in the field of autonomous driving. Currently, few papers consider the safety of reinforcement learning in autonomous lane-change scenarios. We introduce safe hybrid-action reinforcement learning into discretionary lane change for the first time and propose Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic with PID Lagrangian (PASAC-PIDLag) algorithm. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of the Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic (PASAC), which is an unsafe version of PASAC-PIDLag. Both algorithms are employed to train the lane-change strategy of autonomous vehicles to output discrete lane-change decision and longitudinal vehicle acceleration. Our simulation results indicate that at a traffic density of 15 vehicles per kilometer (15 veh/km), the PASAC-PIDLag algorithm exhibits superior safety with a collision rate of 0%, outperforming the PASAC algorithm, which has a collision rate of 1%. The outcomes of the generalization assessments reveal that at low traffic density levels, both the PASAC-PIDLag and PASAC algorithms are proficient in attaining a 0% collision rate. Under conditions of high traffic flow density, the PASAC-PIDLag algorithm surpasses PASAC in terms of both safety and optimality."

It turns out that in the presence of baryon $μ_B$, isospin $μ_I$, chiral $μ_5$ and chiral isospin $μ_{I5}$ chemical potentials the Lagrangians of these models are invariant under the so-called dual transformations. Consequently, the entire NJL model (or QCD) thermodynamic potentials are dually symmetric. In particular, it means that in the total $(μ_B,μ_I,μ_5,μ_{I5})$-phase portraits of these models the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and charged pion condensation (PC) phases are arranged dually conjugated (or symmetrical) to each other (in the case of three-color models). Whereas in the case of two-color quark matter, these models predict the entire phase structure in which there are dual symmetries between CSB, charged PC and baryon superfluid phases."

In this context, we present a numerical study of properties of highly-excited eigenstates of disordered chains with SU(3) symmetry. We find that while weakly disordered systems rapidly thermalize, strongly-disordered systems indeed exhibit non-thermal signatures over a large range of system sizes, similar to the one found in previously studied SU(2) systems. Our analysis is based on the spectral, entanglement, and thermalization properties of eigenstates obtained through large-scale exact diagonalization exploiting the full SU(3) symmetry."

Motivated by the rapid growth in GW detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW observatories enhancing the precision of cosmological and astrophysical measurements is crucial. We propose leveraging the non-linear memory effect -- a subtle, persistent feature in the GW signal resulting from the cumulative impact of emitted gravitational waves -- as a novel approach to enhance parameter estimation accuracy. Through a comprehensive series of injection studies, encompassing both reduced and full parameter spaces, we evaluate the effectiveness of non-linear memory in various scenarios for aligned-spin systems. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of non-linear memory in resolving the inclination-distance degeneracy, particularly for events with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR $>$ 60) for the current generation of detectors and in the context of future detector sensitivities such as the planned LIGO A$^\sharp$ upgrade. The results also suggest that excluding non-linear memory from parameter estimation could introduce significant systematics in future LIGO A$^\sharp$ detections. This observation will hold even greater weight for next-generation detectors, highlighting the importance of including non-linear memory in GW models for achieving high-accuracy measurements for gravitational wave (GW) astronomy."

It has found lately multiple applications in geosciences, archaelogy, and non invasive industrial controls. Mostly known for its imaging capabilities, muography may be exploited as well for monitoring purposes since the atmospheric muon flux is available permanently. In this paper we present an interesting measurement performed in the context of an archaelogical project called Archémuons, on the archaeological site of ""Palais du Miroir"" in Vienne, South of Lyon, France. We installed a muon detector in an underground gallery within the foundations of the building for the second half of 2023. The primary goal is to measure details of those foundations which are largely not excavated yet. Meanwhile we observed over more than 6 months long-term and short-term variations of the muon rates since the start of the experiment, which seem to exhibit a correlation with the rain accumulating on the free field just above the gallery. We propose as an explanation for this behavior the retention of water by the soil above the detector site."

However, it is unclear what the authors' values and attitudes would be regarding AI-bridged CLA. To identify these values and attitudes, we conducted an interview study with 18 authors across eight genres (e.g., poetry, comics) by presenting speculative but realistic AI-bridged CLA scenarios. We identified three benefits derived from the dynamics between author, artifact, and audience: those that 1) authors get from the process, 2) audiences get from the artifact, and 3) authors get from the audience. We found how AI-bridged CLA would either promote or reduce these benefits, along with authors' concerns. We hope our investigation hints at how AI can provide intriguing experiences to CLA audiences while promoting authors' values."

While previous research relies on social media-based datasets annotated with binary categories, i.e. depressed or non-depressed, recent datasets such as D2S and PRIMATE aim for nuanced annotations using PHQ-9 symptoms. However, most of these datasets rely on crowd workers without the domain knowledge for annotation. Focusing on the PRIMATE dataset, our study reveals concerns regarding annotation validity, particularly for the lack of interest or pleasure symptom. Through reannotation by a mental health professional, we introduce finer labels and textual spans as evidence, identifying a notable number of false positives. Our refined annotations, to be released under a Data Use Agreement, offer a higher-quality test set for anhedonia detection. This study underscores the necessity of addressing annotation quality issues in mental health datasets, advocating for improved methodologies to enhance NLP model reliability in mental health assessments."

Nevertheless, previous approaches have primarily relied on textual prompts for image editing, which tend to be less effective when making precise edits to specific objects or fine-grained regions within a scene containing single/multiple objects. We introduce a novel framework for zero-shot localized multi-object editing through a multi-diffusion process to overcome this challenge. This framework empowers users to perform various operations on objects within an image, such as adding, replacing, or editing $\textbf{many}$ objects in a complex scene $\textbf{in one pass}$. Our approach leverages foreground masks and corresponding simple text prompts that exert localized influences on the target regions resulting in high-fidelity image editing. A combination of cross-attention and background preservation losses within the latent space ensures that the characteristics of the object being edited are preserved while simultaneously achieving a high-quality, seamless reconstruction of the background with fewer artifacts compared to the current methods. We also curate and release a dataset dedicated to multi-object editing, named $\texttt{LoMOE}$-Bench. Our experiments against existing state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the improved effectiveness of our approach in terms of both image editing quality and inference speed."

MM-AU contains 11,727 in-the-wild ego-view accident videos, each with temporally aligned text descriptions. We annotate over 2.23 million object boxes and 58,650 pairs of video-based accident reasons, covering 58 accident categories. MM-AU supports various accident understanding tasks, particularly multimodal video diffusion to understand accident cause-effect chains for safe driving. With MM-AU, we present an Abductive accident Video understanding framework for Safe Driving perception (AdVersa-SD). AdVersa-SD performs video diffusion via an Object-Centric Video Diffusion (OAVD) method which is driven by an abductive CLIP model. This model involves a contrastive interaction loss to learn the pair co-occurrence of normal, near-accident, accident frames with the corresponding text descriptions, such as accident reasons, prevention advice, and accident categories. OAVD enforces the causal region learning while fixing the content of the original frame background in video generation, to find the dominant cause-effect chain for certain accidents. Extensive experiments verify the abductive ability of AdVersa-SD and the superiority of OAVD against the state-of-the-art diffusion models. Additionally, we provide careful benchmark evaluations for object detection and accident reason answering since AdVersa-SD relies on precise object and accident reason information."

Our method, HIRO, learns an index structure that maps sentences to a path through a semantically organized discrete hierarchy. At inference time, we populate the index and use it to identify and retrieve clusters of sentences containing popular opinions from input reviews. Then, we use a pretrained LLM to generate a readable summary that is grounded in these extracted evidential clusters. The modularity of our approach allows us to evaluate its efficacy at each stage. We show that HIRO learns an encoding space that is more semantically structured than prior work, and generates summaries that are more representative of the opinions in the input reviews. Human evaluation confirms that HIRO generates more coherent, detailed and accurate summaries that are significantly preferred by annotators compared to prior work."

In the considered model, the base station (BS) needs to transmit a large amount of data to multiple users with RSMA. Due to limited communication resources, the BS is required to utilize semantic communication techniques to compress the large-sized data. The semantic communication is enabled by shared probability graphs between the BS and the users. The probability graph can be used to further compress the transmission data at the BS, while the received compressed semantic information can be recovered through using the same shared probability graph at each user side. The semantic information compression progress consumes additional computation power at the BS, which inevitably decreases the transmission power due to limited total power budget. Considering both the effect of semantic compression ratio and computation power, the semantic rate expression for RSMA is first obtained. Then, based on the obtained rate expression, an optimization problem is formulated with the aim of maximizing the sum of semantic rates of all users under total power, semantic compression ratio, and rate allocation constraints. To tackle this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed, where the rate allocation and transmit beamforming design subproblem is solved using a successive convex approximation method, and the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed using a greedy algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

Conventional techniques like overcommitment and autoscaling fall short, often sacrificing utilization for practicability or incurring performance trade-offs. Overcommitment requires predicting performance to prevent QoS violation, introducing trade-off between prediction accuracy and overheads. Autoscaling requires scaling instances in response to load fluctuations quickly to reduce resource wastage, but more frequent scaling also leads to more cold start overheads. This paper introduces Jiagu, which harmonizes efficiency with practicability through two novel techniques. First, pre-decision scheduling achieves accurate prediction while eliminating overheads by decoupling prediction and scheduling. Second, dual-staged scaling achieves frequent adjustment of instances with minimum overhead. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it using real-world applications and traces from the public cloud platform. Our evaluation shows a 54.8% improvement in deployment density over commercial clouds (with Kubernetes) while maintaining QoS, and 81.0%--93.7% lower scheduling costs and a 57.4%--69.3% reduction in cold start latency compared to existing QoS-aware schedulers in research work."

We show that the configurational entropy of this model exhibits log-periodic oscillations as a function of the sample size, by exploiting an exact recursion relation for the numbers of its jammed configurations. This is seemingly the first statistical-mechanical model where log-periodic oscillations affect the size dependence of an extensive quantity. We then propose and investigate in great depth a one-dimensional analogue of the fragmentation model. This one-dimensional model possesses a critical point, separating a strong-coupling phase where the free energy is super-extensive from a weak-coupling one where the free energy is extensive and exhibits log-periodic oscillations. This model is generalized to a family of one-dimensional models with two integer parameters, which exhibit essentially the same phenomenology."

In this study, we investigate the extent to which technological innovation contributes to a more sustainable future and fosters entrepreneurship. To examine this, we focus on robotic process automation (RPA) highly relevant technology. We conducted a comprehensive analysis by examining the usage of RPA and its impact on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Our research involved gathering data from the 300 largest companies in terms of market capitalization. We assessed whether these companies used RPA and obtained their corresponding ESG ratings. To investigate the relationship between RPA and ESG, we employed a contingency table analysis, which involved categorizing the data based on ESG ratings. We further used Pearson's Chi-square Test of Independence to assess the impact of RPA on ESG. Our findings revealed a statistically significant association between RPA and ESG ratings, indicating their interconnection. The calculated value for Pearson's Chi-square Test of Independence was 6.54, with a corresponding p-value of 0.0381. This indicates that at a significance level of five percent, the RPA and ESG variables depend on each other. These results suggest that RPA, representative of modern technologies, likely influences the achievement of a sustainable future and the promotion of entrepreneurship. In conclusion, our study provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that technological innovations such as RPA have the potential to positively shape sustainability efforts and entrepreneurial endeavours."

In this paper, we show that one can obtain a locality parameter $r$ in such codes by using only non-rational places of degrees at most $r$. This is, up to the author's knowledge, a new way to construct locally recoverable codes (LRCs). We give an example of such a code reaching the Singleton-like bound for LRCs, and show the parameters obtained for some longer codes over $\mathbb F_3$. We then investigate similarities with certain concatenated codes. Contrary to previous methods, our construction allows one to obtain directly codes whose dimension is not a multiple of the locality. Finally, we give an asymptotic study using the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields, for both our construction and a construction of concatenated codes. We give explicit infinite families of LRCs with locality 2 over any finite field of cardinality greater than 3 following our new approach."

We distinguish Relative from Absolute Population Curves, where the former represent statistical power in terms of the normalized effect size between structure and noise, and the latter in terms of the sample size. Relative Population Curves are useful to find the optimal ASCA model (e.g., fixed/random factors, crossed/nested relationships, interactions, the test statistic, transformations, etc.) for the analysis of an experimental design at hand. Absolute Population Curves are useful to determine the sample size and the optimal number of levels for each factor during the planning phase on an experiment. We illustrate both types of curves through simulation. We expect Population Curves to become the go-to approach to plan the optimal analysis pipeline and the required sample size in an omics study analyzed with ASCA."

It is shown that 1+1 field analogue of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model is gauge equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz model, which arises from the Antonov-Hasegawa-Zabrodin trigonometric non-standard $R$-matrix. The latter generalizes the Cherednik's 7-vertex $R$-matrix in ${\rm GL}_2$ case to the case of ${\rm GL}_N$. Explicit change of variables between the 1+1 models is obtained."

We focus on those ratios that have been measured either in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC or in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. The model provides an interpretation how in an expanding hadronic fireball with decreasing temperature the final numbers of stable hadrons after decays of all resonances remain unchanged. Each stable species acquires its own chemical potential and the resonances are kept in equilibrium with them. Multiplicities of unstable resonances provide a test of this scenario. We observe that the ratios of $K^{*}/K$ and $ρ^0/π$ fit reasonably well into the picture of single kinetic freeze-out of the single-particle spectra, but the $φ$-meson and hyperon resonances are not reproduced by this model."

Unlike traditional methods, this technique employs a filtered backprojection type (FBP-type) algorithm, which integrates a unique, adaptive filtering process. This process involves a series of operations, including weightings, differentiations, the 2D Radon transform, and backprojection. The filter is designed for a specific orbit geometry and is obtained using a data-driven approach based on deep learning. The approach efficiently learns and optimizes the orbit-related component of the filter. The method has demonstrated its ability through experimentation by successfully learning parameters from circular orbit projection data. Subsequently, the optimized parameters are used to reconstruct images, resulting in outcomes that closely resemble the analytical solution. This demonstrates the potential of the method to learn appropriate parameters from any specific orbit projection data and achieve reconstruction. The algorithm has demonstrated improvement, particularly in enhancing reconstruction speed and reducing memory usage for handling specific orbit reconstruction."

We introduce HALC, a novel decoding algorithm designed to mitigate OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal visual information in vision-language tasks and operates on both local and global contexts simultaneously. Specifically, HALC integrates a robust auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally) to correct hallucinated tokens on the fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm (globally) to significantly reduce OH while preserving text generation quality. Additionally, HALC can be integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without extra training. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HALC in reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks."

Müller']","The design of direct data-based controllers has become a fundamental part of control theory research in the last few years. In this paper, we consider three classes of data-based state feedback control problems for linear systems. These control problems are such that, besides stabilization, some additional performance requirements must be satisfied. First, we formulate and solve a trajectory-reference control problem, on which desired closed-loop trajectories are known and a controller that allows the system to closely follow those trajectories is computed. Then, in the area of data-based optimal control, we solve two different problems: the inverse problem of optimal control, and the solution of the LQR problem for continuous-time systems. Finally, we consider the case in which the precise position of the desired poles of the closed-loop system is known, and introduce a data-based variant of a robust pole-placement procedure. Although we focus on continuous-time systems, all of the presented methods can also be easily formulated for the discrete-time case. The applicability of the proposed methods is tested using numerical simulations."

In consequence, calibration is almost never validated and the diagnostic is left to the appreciation of the reader. Simulated reference values, based on synthetic calibrated datasets derived from actual uncertainties, have been proposed to palliate this problem. As the generative probability distribution for the simulation of synthetic errors is often not constrained, the sensitivity of simulated reference values to the choice of generative distribution might be problematic, shedding a doubt on the calibration diagnostic. This study explores various facets of this problem, and shows that some statistics are excessively sensitive to the choice of generative distribution to be used for validation when the generative distribution is unknown. This is the case, for instance, of the correlation coefficient between absolute errors and uncertainties (CC) and of the expected normalized calibration error (ENCE). A robust validation workflow to deal with simulated reference values is proposed."

In this setting, a treatment or policy will typically become an object of interest to the researcher when it is either selected from the estimated set of best-performers or arises from a data-dependent selection rule. In this paper, we develop new inference tools for interval-identified parameters chosen via these forms of selection. We develop three types of confidence intervals for data-dependent and interval-identified parameters, discuss how they apply to several examples of interest and prove their uniform asymptotic validity under weak assumptions."

Schmidt']","Long-range interactions are relevant for a large variety of quantum systems in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. In particular, the control of quantum-optical platforms promises to gain deep insights in quantum-critical properties induced by the long-range nature of interactions. From a theoretical perspective, long-range interactions are notoriously complicated to treat. Here, we give an overview of recent advancements to investigate quantum magnets with long-range interactions focusing on two techniques based on Monte Carlo integration. First, the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations where classical Monte Carlo integration is applied within the embedding scheme of white graphs. This linked-cluster expansion allows to extract high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the thermodynamic limit. Second, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo which enables calculations on large finite systems. Finite-size scaling can then be used to determine physical properties of the infinite system. In recent years, both techniques have been applied successfully to one- and two-dimensional quantum magnets involving long-range Ising, XY, and Heisenberg interactions on various bipartite and non-bipartite lattices. Here, we summarise the obtained quantum-critical properties including critical exponents for all these systems in a coherent way. Further, we review how long-range interactions are used to study quantum phase transitions above the upper critical dimension and the scaling techniques to extract these quantum critical properties from the numerical calculations."

Despite its significant performance in well known environments, it remains susceptible to minor conditions variations, raising concerns about its reliability in real-world applications. To improve usability, DRL must demonstrate trustworthiness and robustness. A way to improve robustness of DRL to unknown changes in the conditions is through Adversarial Training, by training the agent against well suited adversarial attacks on the dynamics of the environment. Addressing this critical issue, our work presents an in-depth analysis of contemporary adversarial attack methodologies, systematically categorizing them and comparing their objectives and operational mechanisms. This classification offers a detailed insight into how adversarial attacks effectively act for evaluating the resilience of DRL agents, thereby paving the way for enhancing their robustness."

Black-Schaffer']","Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation."

Fine-tuned encoder models show satisfactory TSA performance, but their background knowledge is limited, and they require a labeled dataset. LLMs offer a potentially universal solution for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge along with in-context learning abilities, yet their performance is heavily influenced by prompt design. Drawing parallels with annotation paradigms for subjective tasks, we explore the influence of prompt design on the performance of LLMs for TSA of news headlines. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs using prompts with different levels of prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts matching annotation guidelines. Recognizing the subjective nature of TSA, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to quantify predictive uncertainty via calibration error and correlation to human inter-annotator agreement. We find that, except for few-shot prompting, calibration and F1-score improve with increased prescriptiveness, but the optimal level depends on the model."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00417,2024-03-01,Rethinking Tokenization: Crafting Better Tokenizers for Large Language Models,['Jinbiao Yang'],"Tokenization significantly influences language models(LMs)' performance. This paper traces the evolution of tokenizers from word-level to subword-level, analyzing how they balance tokens and types to enhance model adaptability while controlling complexity. Despite subword tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) overcoming many word tokenizer limitations, they encounter difficulties in handling non-Latin languages and depend heavily on extensive training data and computational resources to grasp the nuances of multiword expressions (MWEs). This article argues that tokenizers, more than mere technical tools, should drawing inspiration from the cognitive science about human language processing. This study then introduces the ""Principle of Least Effort"" from cognitive science, that humans naturally seek to reduce cognitive effort, and discusses the benefits of this principle for tokenizer development. Based on this principle, the paper proposes that the Less-is-Better (LiB) model could be a new approach for LLM tokenizer. The LiB model can autonomously learn an integrated vocabulary consisting of subwords, words, and MWEs, which effectively reduces both the numbers of tokens and types. Comparative evaluations show that the LiB tokenizer outperforms existing word and BPE tokenizers, presenting an innovative method for tokenizer development, and hinting at the possibility of future cognitive science-based tokenizers being more efficient."

Our pre-training overcomes the limitations of previous methods, which either sacrifice temporal information by converting event sequences into 2D images for utilizing pre-trained image models or directly employ paired image data for knowledge distillation to enhance the learning of event streams. In order to make our pre-training data-efficient, we first design a semantic-uniform masking method to address the learning imbalance caused by the varying reconstruction difficulties of different regions in non-uniform data when using random masking. In addition, we ease the traditional hybrid masked modeling process by explicitly decomposing it into two branches, namely local spatio-temporal reconstruction and global semantic reconstruction to encourage the encoder to capture local correlations and global semantics, respectively. This decomposition allows our selfsupervised learning method to converge faster with minimal pre-training data. Compared to previous approaches, our self-supervised learning method does not rely on paired RGB images, yet enables simultaneous exploration of spatial and temporal cues in multiple scales. It exhibits excellent generalization performance and demonstrates significant improvements across various tasks with fewer parameters and lower computational costs."

In this paper, we study a special class of cyclic Higgs bundles constructed from a $\mathbb Z$-grading $\mathfrak g = \bigoplus_{j=1-m}^{m-1}\mathfrak g_j$ by using the natural representation $G_0 \to GL(\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$, where $G_0 \le G$ is the connected subgroup corresponding to $\mathfrak g_0$. The resulting Higgs pairs include $G^{\mathbb R}$-Higgs bundles for $G^{\mathbb R} \le G$ a real form of Hermitian type (in the case $m=2$) and fixed points of the ${\mathbb C}^*$-action on $G$-Higgs bundles (in the case where the Higgs field vanishes along $\mathfrak g_{1-m}$). In both of these situations a topological invariant with interesting properties, known as the Toledo invariant, has been defined and studied in the literature. This paper generalises its definition and properties to the case of arbitrary $(G_0,\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$-Higgs pairs, which give rise to families of cyclic Higgs bundles. The results are applied to the example with $m=3$ that arises from the theory of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces."

In many such clusters, diffuse radio sources associated with the ICM are found: radio haloes and mini-haloes. Abell 2142 is a rich cluster undergoing extreme core sloshing, generating four cold fronts and a complex multi-component radio halo. Recent work revealed three halo components which span 2.4 Mpc. Particle acceleration on such scales is poorly understood, and requires high-quality multi-frequency data to understand. We use new deep MeerKAT L-band (1283 MHz) observations, combined with LOFAR HBA (143 MHz) data and X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Chandra to study the spectrum of the halo and the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM. We detect the third halo component for the first time at 1283 MHz and confirm its ultra-steep spectrum nature, recovering $α_{\rm H3, total} = -1.68 \pm 0.10$. All components follow power-law spectra which steepen toward the cluster outskirts. We profile the halo along three directions, finding evidence of asymmetry and spectral steepening perpendicular to the main axis of the cluster. Our thermal/non-thermal investigation shows sub-linear correlations that are steeper at 1283 MHz than 143 MHz, and we find different connections in different components of the halo. We find both a moderate anti-correlation (H1, the core) and positive correlation (H2, the ridge) between radio spectral index and X-ray temperature. Our results are broadly consistent with an interpretation of inhomogeneous turbulent (re-)acceleration. However, the anti-correlation between radio spectral index and X- ray temperature in the cluster core is challenging to explain; the presence of three cold fronts and a generally lower temperature may provide the foundations of an explanation."

Each of the above-mentioned standards is based on a different algorithm, introducing distinct types of degradation that may impair the quality of experience when high lossy compression is applied. Although the impact on perceptual quality could be accurately evaluated during subjective quality assessment experiments, objective quality metrics serve as predictors of the visually perceived quality and provide similarity scores without human intervention. Nevertheless, their accuracy can be susceptible to the characteristics of the evaluated media as well as to the type and intensity of the added distortion. While the performance of multiple state-of-the-art objective quality metrics has already been evaluated through their correlation with subjective scores obtained in the presence of artifacts produced by the MPEG standards, no study has evaluated how metrics perform with the more recent JPEG Pleno point cloud coding. In this paper, a study is conducted to benchmark the performance of a large set of objective quality metrics in a subjective dataset including distortions produced by JPEG and MPEG codecs. The dataset also contains three different trade-offs between color and geometry compression for each codec, adding another dimension to the analysis. Performance indexes are computed over the entire dataset but also after splitting according to the codec and to the original model, resulting in detailed insights about the overall performance of each visual quality predictor as well as their cross-content and cross-codec generalization ability."

This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by proposing the adaptive restructuring of Merkle and Verkle trees, fundamental components of blockchain architecture responsible for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient verification processes. Unlike traditional static tree structures, our adaptive model dynamically adjusts the configuration of these trees based on usage patterns, significantly reducing the average path length required for verification and, consequently, the computational overhead associated with these processes. Through a comprehensive conceptual framework, we delineate the methodology for adaptive restructuring, encompassing both binary and non-binary tree configurations. This framework is validated through a series of detailed examples, demonstrating the practical feasibility and the efficiency gains achievable with our approach. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis with existing scalability solutions, highlighting the unique advantages of adaptive restructuring in terms of simplicity, security, and efficiency enhancement without introducing additional complexities or dependencies. This study's implications extend beyond theoretical advancements, offering a scalable, secure, and efficient method for blockchain data verification that could facilitate broader adoption of blockchain technology in finance, supply chain management, and beyond.

In either case, the proliferation of MANET-based applications depends on a multitude of factors, with trustworthiness being one of the primary challenges to be met. Despite the existence of well-known security mechanisms, additional vulnerabilities and features pertinent to this new networking paradigm might render such traditional solutions inapplicable. In particular, the absence of a central authorization facility in an open and distributed communication environment is a major challenge, especially due to the need for cooperative network operation. In particular, in MANET, any node may compromise the routing protocol functionality by disrupting the route discovery process. In this paper, we present a route discovery protocol that mitigates the detrimental effects of such malicious behavior, as to provide correct connectivity information. Our protocol guarantees that fabricated, compromised, or replayed route replies would either be rejected or never reach back the querying node. Furthermore, the protocol responsiveness is safeguarded under different types of attacks that exploit the routing protocol itself. The sole requirement of the proposed scheme is the existence of a security association between the node initiating the query and the sought destination.

The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively separate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial distributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying substance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the measurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances from randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed sensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of substances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and temporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to perform CS. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom data sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing amounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the metabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed results are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can reconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal resolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with that of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge naturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is independent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the acquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the underlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired in the future."

FEM produces discrete approximations of the solution with a discretisation error that can be an be quantified with \emph{a posteriori} error estimates. The practical relevance of error estimates for biomechanics problems, especially for soft tissue where the response is governed by large strains, is rarely addressed. In this contribution, we propose an implementation of \emph{a posteriori} error estimates targeting a user-defined quantity of interest, using the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) technique tailored to biomechanics. The proposed method considers a general setting that encompasses three-dimensional geometries and model non-linearities, which appear in hyperelastic soft tissues. We take advantage of the automatic differentiation capabilities embedded in modern finite element software, which allows the error estimates to be computed generically for a large class of models and constitutive laws. First we validate our methodology using experimental measurements from silicone samples, and then illustrate its applicability for patient-specific computations of pressure ulcers on a human heel."

However, these robots can easily lose their locomotion functionality if damaged by external accidents or internal malfunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to enable a quadrupedal robot to walk with impaired joints. The proposed framework consists of three components: 1) a random joint masking strategy for simulating impaired joint scenarios, 2) a joint state estimator to predict an implicit status of current joint condition based on past observation history, and 3) progressive curriculum learning to allow a single network to conduct both normal gait and various joint-impaired gaits.

Employing a geometric approach, we characterize how many agents can be matched in each group, showing that the set of feasible matchings forms a (discrete) polymatroid. We show how we can define weakly-fair matchings geometrically, for which poly-matroid properties imply that they are maximal. Next, we focus on strong fairness notions (inspired by group-fairness metrics in machine learning), where each group gets their exact same fraction of their entitlement, and we explore the Price of Fairness (PoF), i.e., the loss in optimality when imposing such fairness constraints. Importantly, we advocate for the notion of opportunity fairness, where a group entitlement is the maximum number of agents that can be matched without the presence of other competing groups. We show that the opportunity PoF is bounded independently of the number of agents and jobs, but may be linear in the number of groups. Finally, we provide improved bounds with additional structural properties, or with stochastic graphs."

In particular, the feature extraction takes place in the frequency domain rather than the commonly used spatial (image) domain to facilitate faster computations. The fusion of information from both spatial and frequency spaces creates an efficient model with regards to complexity, required data and performance.

The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach than controlling relaxation parameters would be desired by list-mode PET reconstruction. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. We evaluated LM-MLDS using simulation and clinical data. LM-MLDS provided a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and suppressed an oscillation of tradeoff curves between noise and contrast than the other block iterative methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. LM-MLDS showed different noise properties than the other methods due to Gaussian denoising induced by the proximity operator. The list-mode proximal splitting PET reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferentiable functions such as total variation but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters."

However, recent work has pointed out that the majority of the open source benchmarks available today have been contaminated or leaked into LLMs, meaning that LLMs have access to test data during pretraining and/or fine-tuning. This raises serious concerns about the validity of benchmarking studies conducted so far and the future of evaluation using benchmarks. To solve this problem, we propose Private Benchmarking, a solution where test datasets are kept private and models are evaluated without revealing the test data to the model. We describe various scenarios (depending on the trust placed on model owners or dataset owners), and present solutions to avoid data contamination using private benchmarking. For scenarios where the model weights need to be kept private, we describe solutions from confidential computing and cryptography that can aid in private benchmarking. Finally, we present solutions the problem of benchmark dataset auditing, to ensure that private benchmarks are of sufficiently high quality."

This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially."

We prove that any helical vorticity solution initially concentrated around helices of pairwise distinct radii remains concentrated close to filaments. As suggested by the vortex filament conjecture, we prove that those filaments are translating and rotating helices. Similarly to what is obtained in other frameworks, the localization is weak in the direction of the movement but strong in its normal direction, and holds on an arbitrary long time interval in the naturally rescaled time scale. In order to prove this result, we derive a new explicit formula for the singular part of the Biot-Savart kernel in a two-dimensional reformulation of the problem. This allows us to obtain an appropriate decomposition of the velocity field to reproduce recent methods used to describe the dynamics of vortex rings or point-vortices for the lake equation."

These methods can be classical or Bayesian. The question is placed in the general framework of the problem of nuisance parameters, one of the canonical problems of statistical inference. By using a simple criterion proposed by Bolstad (2007), it is possible to define statistically significant results during a measurement process (act of measuring in the vocabulary of metrology). This result is similar for a classic paradigm (called ""frequentist"") or Bayesian: the presence of zero in the interval considered (confidence or credibility). It is shown that in the case of homoskedastic Gaussians, the commonly used results are found. The case of Poisson distributions is then considered. In the case of heteroscedastic Gaussians, which is that of radioactivity measurement, we can consider them as Poisson laws in the limit of large counts. The results are different from those commonly used, and in particular those from standards (ISO 11929). Their statistical performances, characterized by simulation, are better and are well verified experimentally. This is confirmed theoretically by the use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma which makes it possible to formally determine the statistical tests with the best performances. These results also make it possible to understand the paradox of the possible divergence of the detection limit. It is also formally shown that the confidence intervals thus calculated by getting rid of the nuisance parameter according to established methods result in the commonly used confidence interval. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first formal derivation of these confidence intervals. This method is based on keeping the measurement results whether they are significant or not (not censoring them). This is recommended in several standards or documents, is compatible with the ISO 11929 standard and is in line with recent proposals in the field of statistics. On the other hand, all the information necessary to determine whether a measurement result is significant or not remains available. The conservation and restitution of all results is currently applied in the USA. The textbook case of the WIPP incident makes it possible to ensure favorable public perception. The implications and applications of this method in different fields are finally discussed."

In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller.

Due to their locality, these energies are potentially interesting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about physically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically accurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems. Here, we show that by employing semi-empirical correlations between different components of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a moderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble liquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local energies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are reproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results of our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the total energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the underlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy decomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen systems. Our results are a step towards understanding how much physics can be learned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a better understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural networks."

However, these models display significant limitations when applied to long-tail tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ""decision shortcuts"" that hinders their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit genuine causal invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading, task-irrelevant contextual information, while concurrently emphasizing critical, task-related visual cues. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates its effectiveness."

Mayerhöfer', 'Christof Wöll', 'Carsten Rockstuhl']","In the last years, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS) became a standard technique to study vibrational excitations of molecules. These investigations are strongly motivated by perspective applications in monitoring chemical processes. For a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of molecules on dielectrics, the polarization-dependence of an interaction of infrared light with adsorbates at dielectric surfaces is commonly used. Thus, the peak positions in absorption spectra could be different for s- and p-polarized light. This shift between the peak positions depends on both the molecule itself and the dielectric substrate. While the origin of this shift is well understood for infinite two-dimensional adsorbate layers, finite-size samples, which consist of 2D islands of a small number of molecules, have never been considered. Here, we present a study on polarization-dependent finite-size effects in the optical response of such islands on dielectric substrates. The study uses a multi-scale modeling approach that connects quantum chemistry calculations to Maxwell scattering simulations. We distinguish the optical response of a single molecule, a finite number of molecules, and a two-dimensional adsorbate layer. We analyze CO and CO$_2$ molecules deposited on CeO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The evolution of the shift between the polarization-dependent absorbance peaks is firstly studied for a single molecule, which it does not exhibit for at all, and for finite molecular islands, which it increases with increasing island size for, as well as for an infinite two-dimensional adsorbate layer. In the latter case, the agreement between the obtained results and the experimental IRRAS data and more traditional three/four-layer-model theoretical studies supports the predictive power of the multi-scale approach."

The text-shape pairs exhibit a hierarchical structure, where a general text like ""chair"" covers all 3D shapes of the chair, while more detailed prompts refer to more specific shapes. Furthermore, both text and 3D shapes are inherently hierarchical structures. However, existing Text2Shape methods, such as SDFusion, do not exploit that. In this work, we propose HyperSDFusion, a dual-branch diffusion model that generates 3D shapes from a given text. Since hyperbolic space is suitable for handling hierarchical data, we propose to learn the hierarchical representations of text and 3D shapes in hyperbolic space. First, we introduce a hyperbolic text-image encoder to learn the sequential and multi-modal hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In addition, we design a hyperbolic text-graph convolution module to learn the hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In order to fully utilize these text features, we introduce a dual-branch structure to embed text features in 3D feature space. At last, to endow the generated 3D shapes with a hierarchical structure, we devise a hyperbolic hierarchical loss. Our method is the first to explore the hyperbolic hierarchical representation for text-to-shape generation. Experimental results on the existing text-to-shape paired dataset, Text2Shape, achieved state-of-the-art results."

Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals with topological node structure but without Q1D chain structure, including the existing compounds \b{eta}-Fe2(PO4)O and Co2(PO4)O, and LiTi2O4. All these materials have an AFM ground state and exhibit an ideal crossed Z3 Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the whole Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AFM Z3 nodal net. Surprisingly, we find that the longitudinal conductivity σxx in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than σyy and σzz in the up-spin channel, while σyy dominates the transport in the down-spin channel. This means that each spin channel has a Q1D transport signature, and the principal moving direction for the two spin channels is orthogonal, leading to Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon can not be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials, and may solely be induced by the Z3 nodal net, as it gradually disappears when the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in antiferromagnets, but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics."

However, the optimization of E2E models lacks an intuitive method for handling decoding shifts, especially in scenarios with a large number of domain-specific rare words that hold specific important meanings. Furthermore, the absence of knowledge-intensive speech datasets in academia has been a significant limiting factor, and the commonly used speech corpora exhibit significant disparities with realistic conversation. To address these challenges, we present Medical Interview (MED-IT), a multi-turn consultation speech dataset that contains a substantial number of knowledge-intensive named entities. We also explore methods to enhance the recognition performance of rare words for E2E models. We propose a novel approach, post-decoder biasing, which constructs a transform probability matrix based on the distribution of training transcriptions. This guides the model to prioritize recognizing words in the biasing list. In our experiments, for subsets of rare words appearing in the training speech between 10 and 20 times, and between 1 and 5 times, the proposed method achieves a relative improvement of 9.3% and 5.1%, respectively."

Abrahams', 'Mourad Oudich', 'Yann Revalor', 'Nicolas Vukadinovic', 'Badreddine Assouar']","To this day, achieving broadband low-frequency sound absorption remains a challenge even with the possibilities promised by the advent of metamaterials and metasurfaces, especially when size and structural restrictions exist. Solving this engineering challenge relies on stringent impedance matching and coupling of the multiple independent local resonators in metasurface absorbers. In this letter, we present an innovative design approach to broaden the sound absorption bandwidth at low-frequency regime. A hybrid metasurface design is proposed where four coupled planar coiled resonators are also coupled to a well designed thin planar cavity. This hybrid metasurface creates a broad sound absorption band (130-200 Hz) that is twice as wide as that of the traditional single layer metasurface utilizing four coiled cavities at a deep sub-wavelength thickness (< λ/51). This design strategy open routes towards engineering a class of high performance thin metasurfaces for ultra-broadband sound absorption while keeping the planar size unchanged."

First, unlike more traditional domains like retail, movie etc., a large amount of user feedback is not available and the item catalog is smaller. Second, due to the higher complexity of products, the majority of users still prefer to complete their purchases over the phone instead of online. We present different recommender models to address such data scarcity in the insurance domain. We use recurrent neural networks with 3 different types of loss functions and architectures (cross-entropy, censored Weibull, attention). Our models cope with data scarcity by learning from multiple sessions and different types of user actions. Moreover, differently from previous session-based models, our models learn to predict a target action that does not happen within the session. Our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world insurance dataset, with ca. 44K users, 16 items, 54K purchases and 117K sessions. Moreover, combining our models with demographic data boosts the performance. Analysis shows that considering multiple sessions and several types of actions are both beneficial for the models, and that our models are not unfair with respect to age, gender and income."

However, due to the hardware resource limitations of currently available quantum computers, such as the limited number of qubits, lack of high-fidelity gating operation, and low noisy tolerance, the practical application of the QACO is quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO algorithm, so that this extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization problems, which makes the practical application of QACO based on available quantum computation resource possible. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the algorithm, we tested the developed QACO algorithm with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks. The developed QACO algorithm shows better performance under multiple data set. In addition, the developed QACO algorithm also manifests the robustness to noise of calculation process, which is typically a major barrier for practical application of quantum computers. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with QACO has effectively extended the application scenario of QACO in current NISQ era of quantum computing."

Kosel', 'S. Michel', 'T. Seidel', 'M. Foerster']","Multimodal data analysis and validation based on streams from state-of-the-art sensor technology such as eye-tracking or emotion recognition using the Facial Action Coding System (FACTs) with deep learning allows educational researchers to study multifaceted learning and problem-solving processes and to improve educational experiences. This study aims to investigate the correlation between two continuous sensor streams, pupil diameter as an indicator of cognitive workload and FACTs with deep learning as an indicator of emotional arousal (RQ 1a), specifically for epochs of high, medium, and low arousal (RQ 1b). Furthermore, the time lag between emotional arousal and pupil diameter data will be analyzed (RQ 2). 28 participants worked on three cognitively demanding and emotionally engaging everyday moral dilemmas while eye-tracking and emotion recognition data were collected. The data were pre-processed in Phyton (synchronization, blink control, downsampling) and analyzed using correlation analysis and Granger causality tests. The results show negative and statistically significant correlations between the data streams for emotional arousal and pupil diameter. However, the correlation is negative and significant only for epochs of high arousal, while positive but non-significant relationships were found for epochs of medium or low arousal. The average time lag for the relationship between arousal and pupil diameter was 2.8 ms. In contrast to previous findings without a multimodal approach suggesting a positive correlation between the constructs, the results contribute to the state of research by highlighting the importance of multimodal data validation and research on convergent vagility. Future research should consider emotional regulation strategies and emotional valence."

Infusing Humor into Conversational Agent for Behavioral Intervention,"['Xin Sun', 'Isabelle Teljeur', 'Zhuying Li', 'Jos A. Bosch']","Regular physical activity is crucial for reducing the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD). With NCDs on the rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective health interventions, with chatbots emerging as a viable and cost-effective option because of limited healthcare accessibility. Although health professionals often utilize behavior change techniques (BCTs) to boost physical activity levels and enhance client engagement and motivation by affiliative humor, the efficacy of humor in chatbot-delivered interventions is not well-understood. This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the generative humorous communication style in a 10-day chatbot-delivered intervention for physical activity. It further investigated if user engagement and motivation act as mediators between the communication style and changes in physical activity levels. 66 participants engaged with the chatbots across three groups (humorous, non-humorous, and no-intervention) and responded to daily ecological momentary assessment questionnaires assessing engagement, motivation, and physical activity levels. Multilevel time series analyses revealed that an affiliative humorous communication style positively impacted physical activity levels over time, with user engagement acting as a mediator in this relationship, whereas motivation did not. These findings clarify the role of humorous communication style in chatbot-delivered physical activity interventions, offering valuable insights for future development of intelligent conversational agents incorporating humor."

Moreover, by using the forward-backward algorithm, the approximate results are explained by dynamic graphs to monitor the effectiveness of vaccination."
