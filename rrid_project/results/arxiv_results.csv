"Studying Disease Reinfection Rates, Vaccine Efficacy and the Timing of Vaccine Rollout in the context of Infectious Diseases",2023-12-28 00:00:00,"Elizabeth Amona, Indranil Sahoo, Edward Boone, Ryad Ghanam",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16846,"Qatar has undergone distinct waves of COVID-19 infections, compounded by the emergence of variants, posing additional complexities. This research uniquely delves into the varied efficacy of existing vaccines and the pivotal role of vaccination timing in the context of COVID-19. Departing from conventional modeling, we introduce two models that account for the impact of vaccines on infections, reinfections, and deaths. Recognizing the intricacy of these models, we use the Bayesian framework and specifically utilize the Metropolis-Hastings Sampler for estimation of model parameters. The study conducts scenario analyses on two models, quantifying the duration during which the healthcare system in Qatar could have potentially been overwhelmed by an influx of new COVID-19 cases surpassing the available hospital beds. Additionally, the research explores similarities in predictive probability distributions of cumulative infections, reinfections, and deaths, employing the Hellinger distance metric. Comparative analysis, employing the Bayes factor, underscores the plausibility of a model assuming a different susceptibility rate to reinfection, as opposed to assuming the same susceptibility rate for both infections and reinfections. Results highlight the adverse outcomes associated with delayed vaccination, emphasizing the efficacy of early vaccination in reducing infections, reinfections, and deaths. Our research advocates prioritizing early vaccination as a key strategy in effectively combating future pandemics. This study contributes vital insights for evidence-based public health interventions, providing clarity on vaccination strategies and reinforcing preparedness for challenges posed by infectious diseases. The data set and implementation code for this project is made available at \url{https://github.com/elizabethamona/VaccinationTiming}."
Evaluating infectious disease forecasts with allocation scoring rules,2023-12-23 00:00:00,"Aaron Gerding, Nicholas G. Reich, Benjamin Rogers, Evan L. Ray",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16201,"Recent years have seen increasing efforts to forecast infectious disease burdens, with a primary goal being to help public health workers make informed policy decisions. However, there has only been limited discussion of how predominant forecast evaluation metrics might indicate the success of policies based in part on those forecasts. We explore one possible tether between forecasts and policy: the allocation of limited medical resources so as to minimize unmet need. We use probabilistic forecasts of disease burden in each of several regions to determine optimal resource allocations, and then we score forecasts according to how much unmet need their associated allocations would have allowed. We illustrate with forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US, and we find that the forecast skill ranking given by this allocation scoring rule can vary substantially from the ranking given by the weighted interval score. We see this as evidence that the allocation scoring rule detects forecast value that is missed by traditional accuracy measures and that the general strategy of designing scoring rules that are directly linked to policy performance is a promising direction for epidemic forecast evaluation."
Reinforcement Learning for Safe Occupancy Strategies in Educational Spaces during an Epidemic,2023-12-22 00:00:00,"Elizabeth Akinyi Ondula, Bhaskar Krishnamachari",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15163,"Epidemic modeling, encompassing deterministic and stochastic approaches, is vital for understanding infectious diseases and informing public health strategies. This research adopts a prescriptive approach, focusing on reinforcement learning (RL) to develop strategies that balance minimizing infections with maximizing in-person interactions in educational settings. We introduce SafeCampus , a novel tool that simulates infection spread and facilitates the exploration of various RL algorithms in response to epidemic challenges. SafeCampus incorporates a custom RL environment, informed by stochastic epidemic models, to realistically represent university campus dynamics during epidemics. We evaluate Q-learning for a discretized state space which resulted in a policy matrix that not only guides occupancy decisions under varying epidemic conditions but also illustrates the inherent trade-off in epidemic management. This trade-off is characterized by the dilemma between stricter measures, which may effectively reduce infections but impose less educational benefit (more in-person interactions), and more lenient policies, which could lead to higher infection rates."
The Effect of Vaccination on the Competitive Advantage of Two Strains of an Infectious Disease,2023-12-22 00:00:00,"Matthew D. Johnston, Bruce Pell, Jared Pemberton, David A. Rubel",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14997,"We investigate how a population's natural and vaccine immunity affects the competitive balance between two strains of an infectious disease with different epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case where one strain is more transmissible and the other strain is more immune-resistant. The competition of these strains is modeled by two SIR-type models which incorporate waning natural immunity and which have distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Waning immunity is implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is analyzed using the linear chain trick to transform the delay differential equation systems into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that vaccination has a significant effect on the competitive balance between two strains, potentially leading to dramatic flips from one strain dominating in the population to the other. We also show that which strain gains an advantage as a population's immunity level increases depends upon the integration between the mechanisms of natural and vaccine immunity. The results of this paper are consequently relevant for public policy."
Explosive epidemic transitions induced by quarantine fatigue,2023-12-22 00:00:00,L. D. Valdez,https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14703,"Quarantine measures are one of the first lines of defense against the spread of infectious diseases. However, maintaining these measures over extended periods can be challenging due to a phenomenon known as quarantine fatigue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of quarantine fatigue on the spread of infectious diseases by using an epidemic model on random networks with cliques. In our model, susceptible individuals can be quarantined up to $n$ times, after which they stop complying with quarantine orders due to fatigue. Our results show that quarantine fatigue may induce a regime in which increasing the probability of detecting and isolating infected individuals (along with their close contacts) could subsequently increase the expected number of cases at the end of an outbreak. Moreover, we observe that quarantine fatigue can trigger an abrupt phase transition at the critical reproduction number $R_0=1$. Finally, we explore a scenario where a non-negligible number of individuals are infected at the beginning of an epidemic, and our results show that, depending on the value of $n$, an abrupt transition between a controlled epidemic and a large epidemic event can occur for $R_0<1$."
Spatiotemporal risk prediction for infectious disease spread and mortality,2023-12-05 00:00:00,"Catherine Li, Daniel Lazarev",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14165,"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, various studies have focused on predicting the trajectory and risk factors of the virus and its variants. Building on previous work that addressed this problem using genetic and epidemiological data, we introduce a method, Geo Score, that also incorporates geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic data to estimate infection and mortality risk by region and time. We employ gradient descent to find the optimal weights of the factors' significance in determining risk. Such spatiotemporal risk prediction is important for informed public health decision-making so that individuals are aware of the risks of travel during an epidemic or pandemic, and, perhaps more importantly, so that policymakers know how to triage limited resources during a crisis. We apply our method to New York City COVID-19 data from 2020, predicting ZIP code-level COVID-19 risk for 2021."
Efficient coupling of within- and between-host infectious disease dynamics,2023-12-18 00:00:00,"Cameron A. Smith, Ben Ashby",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11592,"Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission typically neglect within-host dynamics. Yet within-host dynamics - including pathogen replication, host immune responses, and interactions with microbiota - are crucial not only for determining the progression of disease at the individual level, but also for driving within-host evolution and onwards transmission, and therefore shape dynamics at the population level. Various approaches have been proposed to model both within- and between-host dynamics, but these typically require considerable simplifying assumptions to couple processes at contrasting scales (e.g., the within-host dynamics quickly reach a steady state) or are computationally intensive. Here we propose a novel, readily adaptable and broadly applicable method for modelling both within- and between-host processes which can fully couple dynamics across scales and is both realistic and computationally efficient. By individually tracking the deterministic within-host dynamics of infected individuals, and stochastically coupling these to continuous host state variables at the population-level, we take advantage of fast numerical methods at both scales while still capturing individual transient within-host dynamics and stochasticity in transmission between hosts. Our approach closely agrees with full stochastic individual-based simulations and is especially useful when the within-host dynamics do not rapidly reach a steady state or over longer timescales to track pathogen evolution. By applying our method to different pathogen growth scenarios we show how common simplifying assumptions fundamentally change epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics."
Feasible contact tracing,2023-12-09 00:00:00,"Aparajithan Venkateswaran, Jishnu Das, Tyler H. McCormick",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05718,"Contact tracing is one of the most important tools for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, but as the experience of COVID-19 showed, it is also next-to-impossible to implement when the disease is spreading rapidly. We show how to substantially improve the efficiency of contact tracing by combining standard microeconomic tools that measure heterogeneity in how infectious a sick person is with ideas from machine learning about sequential optimization. Our contributions are twofold. First, we incorporate heterogeneity in individual infectiousness in a multi-armed bandit to establish optimal algorithms. At the heart of this strategy is a focus on learning. In the typical conceptualization of contact tracing, contacts of an infected person are tested to find more infections. Under a learning-first framework, however, contacts of infected persons are tested to ascertain whether the infected person is likely to be a ""high infector"" and to find additional infections only if it is likely to be highly fruitful. Second, we demonstrate using three administrative contact tracing datasets from India and Pakistan during COVID-19 that this strategy improves efficiency. Using our algorithm, we find 80% of infections with just 40% of contacts while current approaches test twice as many contacts to identify the same number of infections. We further show that a simple strategy that can be easily implemented in the field performs at nearly optimal levels, allowing for, what we call, feasible contact tracing. These results are immediately transferable to contact tracing in any epidemic."
On the calibration of compartmental epidemiological models,2023-12-08 00:00:00,"Nikunj Gupta, Anh Mai, Azza Abouzied, Dennis Shasha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05456,"Epidemiological compartmental models are useful for understanding infectious disease propagation and directing public health policy decisions. Calibration of these models is an important step in offering accurate forecasts of disease dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions. In this study, we present an overview of calibrating strategies that can be employed, including several optimization methods and reinforcement learning (RL). We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these methods and highlight relevant practical conclusions from our experiments. Optimization methods iteratively adjust the parameters of the model until the model output matches the available data, whereas RL uses trial and error to learn the optimal set of parameters by maximizing a reward signal. Finally, we discuss how the calibration of parameters of epidemiological compartmental models is an emerging field that has the potential to improve the accuracy of disease modeling and public health decision-making. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness and scalability of these approaches in different epidemiological contexts. All codes and resources are available on \url{https://github.com/Nikunj-Gupta/On-the-Calibration-of-Compartmental-Epidemiological-Models}. We hope this work can facilitate related research."
Digital Epidemiology after COVID-19: impact and prospects,2023-12-08 00:00:00,"Sara Mesquita, Lília Perfeito, Daniela Paolotti, Joana Gonçalves-Sá",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04835,"Epidemiology and Public Health have increasingly relied on structured and unstructured data, collected inside and outside of typical health systems, to study, identify, and mitigate diseases at the population level. Focusing on infectious disease, we review how Digital Epidemiology (DE) was at the beginning of 2020 and how it was changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, in both nature and breadth. We argue that DE will become a progressively useful tool as long as its potential is recognized and its risks are minimized. Therefore, we expand on the current views and present a new definition of DE that, by highlighting the statistical nature of the datasets, helps in identifying possible biases. We offer some recommendations to reduce inequity and threats to privacy and argue in favour of complex multidisciplinary approaches to tackling infectious diseases."
Information Design for Hybrid Work under Infectious Disease Transmission Risk,2023-12-07 00:00:00,"Sohil Shah, Saurabh Amin, Patrick Jaillet",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04073,"We study a planner's provision of information to manage workplace occupancy when strategic workers (agents) face risk of infectious disease transmission. The planner implements an information mechanism to signal information about the underlying risk of infection at the workplace. Agents update their belief over the risk parameter using this information and choose to work in-person or remotely. We address the design of the optimal signaling mechanism that best aligns the workplace occupancy with the planner's preference (i.e., maintaining safe capacity limits and operational efficiency at workplace). For various forms of planner preferences, we show numerical and analytical proof that interval-based information mechanisms are optimal. These mechanisms partition the continuous domain of the risk parameter into disjoint intervals and provision information based on interval-specific probability distributions over a finite set of signals. When the planner seeks to achieve an occupancy that lies in one of finitely many pre-specified ranges independent of the underlying risk, we provide an optimal mechanism that uses at most two intervals. On the other hand, when the preference on the occupancy is risk-dependent, we show that an approximately optimal interval-based mechanism can be computed efficiently. We bound the approximation loss for preferences that are expressed through a Lipschitz continuous function of both occupancy and risk parameter. We provide examples that demonstrate the improvement of proposed signaling mechanisms relative to the common benchmarks in information provision. Our findings suggest that information provision over the risk of disease transmission is an effective intervention for maintaining desirable occupancy levels at the workplace."
Masking Behaviors in Epidemiological Networks with Cognitively-plausible Reinforcement Learning,2023-12-06 00:00:00,"Konstantinos Mitsopoulos, Lawrence Baker, Christian Lebiere, Peter Pirolli, Mark Orr, Raffaele Vardavas",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03301,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of human behavior in influencing infectious disease transmission and the need for models capturing this complex dynamic. We present an agent-based model integrating an epidemiological simulation of disease spread with a cognitive architecture driving individual mask-wearing decisions. Agents decide whether to mask based on a utility function weighting factors like peer conformity, personal risk tolerance, and mask-wearing discomfort. By conducting experiments systematically varying behavioral model parameters and social network structures, we demonstrate how adaptive decision-making interacts with network connectivity patterns to impact population-level infection outcomes. The model provides a flexible computational framework for gaining insights into how behavioral interventions like mask mandates may differentially influence disease spread across communities with diverse social structures. Findings highlight the importance of integrating realistic human decision processes in epidemiological models to inform policy decisions during public health crises."
SimPLoID: Harnessing probabilistic logic programming for infectious disease epidemiology,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Felix Weitkämper, Ameen Almiftah, Kailin Sun",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00934,"High quality epidemiological modelling is essential in order to combat the spread of infectious diseases. In this contribution, we present SimPLoID, an epidemiological modelling framework based on the probabilistic logic programming language ProbLog. SimPLoiI combines concepts from compartmental modelling, such as the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, with network-based modelling. As a proof of concept, SimPLoID showcases the potential of declarative probabilistic logic programming for a natural, flexible and compact expression of infectious disease dynamics. In particular, its modularity makes it easily extendable in the face of changing requirements. This application area benefits especially from the precisely specified semantics of the ProbLog language and from the well-maintained engines, which support a variety of query types from exact inference to Monte Carlo simulation. We also provide a domain-specific language designed for researchers not trained in programming, which is compiled to ProbLog clauses within an interactive Python application."
"A spatial analysis of COVID-19 reported cases in the Gauteng province, South Africa: Identifying wards to be targeted early in future infectious diseases outbreak",2023-11-29 00:00:00,"Mahdi Salehi, Samuel Manda, Mohammad Arashi, Andriette Bekker",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17430,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions and contributed to the loss of livelihoods and income. The pandemic also provided public health and health systems policy shifts towards better promotion and protection in responding to such disasters and emergencies. Due to differing effects of socio-economic infectious disease vulnerabilities and pre-pandemic levels of preparedness for health emergencies, health system strengthening requires targeted and ununiform implementation. We employ spatial statistical methods on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in identifying wards that could be targeted for strengthening health security in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. In this way, the identified high-risk wards would be more effective and prepared to respond to future pandemics and emergencies."
Impact of Indoor Mobility Behavior on the Respiratory Infectious Diseases Transmission Trends,2023-11-28 00:00:00,"Ziwei Cui, Ming Cai, Zheng Zhu, Gongbo Chen, Yao Xiao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17318,"The importance of indoor human mobility in the transmission dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases has been acknowledged. Previous studies have predominantly addressed a single type of mobility behavior such as queueing and a series of behaviors under specific scenarios. However, these studies ignore the abstraction of mobility behavior in various scenes and the critical examination of how these abstracted behaviors impact disease propagation. To address these problems, this study considers people's mobility behaviors in a general scenario, abstracting them into two main categories: crowding behavior, related to the spatial aspect, and stopping behavior, related to the temporal aspect. Accordingly, this study investigates their impacts on disease spreading and the impact of individual spatio-temporal distribution resulting from these mobility behaviors on epidemic transmission. First, a point of interest (POI) method is introduced to quantify the crowding-related spatial POI factors (i.e., the number of crowdings and the distance between crowdings) and stopping-related temporal POI factors (i.e., the number of stoppings and the duration of each stopping). Besides, a personal space determined with Voronoi diagrams is used to construct the individual spatio-temporal distribution factor. Second, two indicators (i.e., the daily number of new cases and the average exposure risk of people) are applied to quantify epidemic transmission. These indicators are derived from a fundamental model which accurately predicts disease transmission between moving individuals. Third, a set of 200 indoor scenarios is constructed and simulated to help determine variable values. Concurrently, the influences and underlying mechanisms of these behavioral factors on disease transmission are examined using structural equation modeling and causal inference modeling......"
Optimal Social and Vaccination Control in the SVIR Epidemic Model,2023-11-27 00:00:00,Alessandro Ramponiand M. Elisabetta Tessitore,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15718,"In this paper we introduce an approach to the management of infectious disease diffusion through the formulation of a controlled compartmental SVIR (Susceptible-Vaccinated-Infected-Recovered) model. We consider a cost functional encompassing three distinct yet interconnected dimensions: the social cost, the disease cost, and the vaccination cost. The proposed model addresses the pressing need for optimized strategies in disease containment, incorporating both social control measures and vaccination campaigns. Through the utilization of advanced control theory, we identify optimal control strategies that mitigate disease proliferation while considering the inherent trade-offs among social interventions and vaccination efforts. Finally, numerical implementation of the optimally controlled system through the Forward-Backward Sweep algorithm is presented."
Semi-metric topology characterizes epidemic spreading on complex networks,2023-11-24 00:00:00,"David Soriano Paños, Felipe Xavier Costa, Luis M. Rocha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14817,"Network sparsification represents an essential tool to extract the core of interactions sustaining both networks dynamics and their connectedness. In the case of infectious diseases, network sparsification methods remove irrelevant connections to unveil the primary subgraph driving the unfolding of epidemic outbreaks in real networks. In this paper, we explore the features determining whether the metric backbone, a subgraph capturing the structure of shortest paths across a network, allows reconstructing epidemic outbreaks. We find that both the relative size of the metric backbone, capturing the fraction of edges kept in such structure, and the distortion of semi-metric edges, quantifying how far those edges not included in the metric backbone are from their associated shortest path, shape the retrieval of Susceptible-Infected (SI) dynamics. We propose a new method to progressively dismantle networks relying on the semi-metric edge distortion, removing first those connections farther from those included in the metric backbone, i.e. those with highest semi-metric distortion values. We apply our method in both synthetic and real networks, finding that semi-metric distortion provides solid ground to preserve spreading dynamics and connectedness while sparsifying networks."
Infectious disease surveillance needs for the United States: lessons from COVID-19,2023-11-22 00:00:00,"Marc Lipsitch, Mary T. Bassett, John S. Brownstein, Paul Elliott, David Eyre, M.

Here, we discuss requirements for an effective surveillance system to support decision making during a pandemic, drawing on the lessons of COVID-19 in the U.S., while looking to jurisdictions in the U.S. and beyond to learn lessons about the value of specific data types. In this report, we define the range of decisions for which surveillance data are required, the data elements needed to inform these decisions and to calibrate inputs and outputs of transmission-dynamic models, and the types of data needed to inform decisions by state, territorial, local, and tribal health authorities. We define actions needed to ensure that such data will be available and consider the contribution of such efforts to improving health equity."
Dynamics of a two-strain epidemic model with waning immunity -- a perturbative approach,2023-11-19 00:00:00,"Nir Gavish, Musa Rabiu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11318,"Many infectious diseases are comprised of multiple strains with examples including Influenza, tuberculosis, and Dengue virus. The time evolution of such systems is linked to a complex landscape shaped by interactions between competing strains. Possible long-term dynamics include the extinction of less competitive strains, convergence to multi-strain steady-states, or self-sustained oscillations. This work considers a two-strain epidemic model in which the strains can interact indirectly via the immunity response generated following infections, and in which this immune response wanes with time. In particular, we focus on scenarios where the rate of waning immunity is significantly faster than the rate of demographic turnover. The first key result of this study is the explicit computation of the steady states of the nonlinear system of seven equations. Following this result, we take advantage of the separation of time scales in the problem and use perturbation methods to analyze the stability of the fixed points. In particular, we establish the conditions under which the system gives rise to the coexistence of the two strains and whether coexistence is attained via convergence to an endemic steady-state or via self-sustained oscillations. Our study unveils two parameter regimes of distinct qualitative behavior of the system and characterizes the separatrix between them. Within the first regime, the system gives rise to oscillatory coexistence for all feasible conditions. In the second regime, the system's behavior is governed by a solution to a quadratic equation, potentially resulting in the convergence to a multi-strain endemic equilibrium or the persistence of oscillatory coexistence."
A Recent Survey of the Advancements in Deep Learning Techniques for Monkeypox Disease Detection,2023-11-23 00:00:00,"Saddam Hussain Khan, Rashid Iqbal, Saeeda Naz",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10754,"Monkeypox (MPox) is a zoonotic infectious disease induced by the MPox Virus, part of the poxviridae orthopoxvirus group initially discovered in Africa and gained global attention in mid-2022 with cases reported outside endemic areas. Symptoms include headaches, chills, fever, smallpox, measles, and chickenpox-like skin manifestations and the WHO officially announced MPox as a global public health pandemic, in July 2022.Traditionally, PCR testing of skin lesions is considered a benchmark for the primary diagnosis by WHO, with symptom management as the primary treatment and antiviral drugs like tecovirimat for severe cases. However, manual analysis within hospitals poses a substantial challenge including the substantial burden on healthcare professionals, limited facilities, availability and fatigue among doctors, and human error during public health emergencies. Therefore, this survey paper provides an extensive and efficient analysis of deep learning (DL) methods for the automatic detection of MPox in skin lesion images. These DL techniques are broadly grouped into categories, including deep CNN, Deep CNNs ensemble, deep hybrid learning, the newly developed, and Vision transformer for diagnosing MPox. Moreover, this study offers a systematic exploration of the evolutionary progression of DL techniques and identifies, and addresses limitations in previous methods while highlighting the valuable contributions and innovation. Additionally, the paper addresses benchmark datasets and their collection from various authentic sources, pre-processing techniques, and evaluation metrics. The survey also briefly delves into emerging concepts, identifies research gaps, limitations, and applications, and outlines challenges in the diagnosis process. This survey furnishes valuable insights into the prospective areas of DL innovative ideas and is anticipated to serve as a path for researchers."

This article introduces a versatile open-source simulation framework designed to model intricate dynamics of infectious diseases across diverse population centres. Taking inspiration from historical precedents such as the Spanish flu and COVID-19, and geographical economic theories such as Central place theory, the simulation integrates agent-based modelling to depict the movement and interactions of individuals within different settlement hierarchies. Additionally, the framework provides a tool for decision-makers to assess and strategize optimal distribution plans for limited resources like vaccines or cures as well as to impose mobility restrictions."
On simulation-based inference for implicitly defined models,2023-11-15 00:00:00,Joonha Park,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09446,"In many applications, a stochastic system is studied using a model implicitly defined via a simulator. We develop a simulation-based parameter inference method for implicitly defined models. Our method differs from traditional likelihood-based inference in that it uses a metamodel for the distribution of a log-likelihood estimator. The metamodel is built on a local asymptotic normality (LAN) property satisfied by the simulation-based log-likelihood estimator under certain conditions. A method for hypothesis test is developed under the metamodel. Our method can enable accurate parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification where other Monte Carlo methods for parameter inference become highly inefficient due to large Monte Carlo variance. We demonstrate our method using numerical examples including a mechanistic model for the population dynamics of infectious disease."
Devil in the Landscapes: Inferring Epidemic Exposure Risks from Street View Imagery,2023-11-08 00:00:00,"Zhenyu Han, Yanxin Xi, Tong Xia, Yu Liu, Yong Li",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09240,"Built environment supports all the daily activities and shapes our health. Leveraging informative street view imagery, previous research has established the profound correlation between the built environment and chronic, non-communicable diseases; however, predicting the exposure risk of infectious diseases remains largely unexplored. The person-to-person contacts and interactions contribute to the complexity of infectious disease, which is inherently different from non-communicable diseases. Besides, the complex relationships between street view imagery and epidemic exposure also hinder accurate predictions. To address these problems, we construct a regional mobility graph informed by the gravity model, based on which we propose a transmission-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture disease transmission patterns arising from human mobility. Experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline models by 8.54% in weighted F1, shedding light on a low-cost, scalable approach to assess epidemic exposure risks from street view imagery."
Theory of Infectious Diseases with Testing and Testing-less Covid-19 Endemic,2023-11-14 00:00:00,"Bo Deng, Chayu Yang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08611,"What is the long term dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic? How will it end? Here we constructed an infectious disease model with testing and analyzed the existence and stability of its endemic states. For a large parameter set, including those relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrated the existence of one endemic equilibrium without testing and one endemic equilibrium with testing and proved their local and global stabilities for some cases. Our results suggest that the pandemic is to end with a testing-less endemic state through a novel and surprising mechanism called stochastic trapping."
Assessing the potential impact of environmental land management schemes on emergent infection disease risks,2023-11-13 00:00:00,"Christopher J. Banks, Katherine Simpson, Nicholas Hanley, Rowland R. Kao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07735,"Financial incentives are provided by governments to encourage the plantation of new woodland to increase habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and other economic benefits for landowners. Whilst these are largely positive effects, it is worth considering that greater biodiversity and presence of wildlife species in proximity to agricultural holdings may pose a risk of disease transmission between wildlife and livestock. Wildlife transmission and the provision of a reservoir for infectious disease is particularly important in the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis."
Creating a Discipline-specific Commons for Infectious Disease Epidemiology,2023-11-12 00:00:00,"Michael M. Wagner, William Hogan, John Levander, Adam Darr, Matt Diller, Max Sibilla, Alexander T. Loiacono. Terence Sperringer, Jr., Shawn T. Brown",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06989,"Objective: To create a commons for infectious disease (ID) epidemiology in which epidemiologists, public health officers, data producers, and software developers can not only share data and software, but receive assistance in improving their interoperability. Materials and Methods: We represented 586 datasets, 54 software, and 24 data formats in OWL 2 and then used logical queries to infer potentially interoperable combinations of software and datasets, as well as statistics about the FAIRness of the collection. We represented the objects in DATS 2.2 and a software metadata schema of our own design. We used these representations as the basis for the Content, Search, FAIR-o-meter, and Workflow pages that constitute the MIDAS Digital Commons. Results: Interoperability was limited by lack of standardization of input and output formats of software. When formats existed, they were human-readable specifications (22/24; 92%); only 3 formats (13%) had machine-readable specifications. Nevertheless, logical search of a triple store based on named data formats was able to identify scores of potentially interoperable combinations of software and datasets. Discussion: We improved the findability and availability of a sample of software and datasets and developed metrics for assessing interoperability. The barriers to interoperability included poor documentation of software input/output formats and little attention to standardization of most types of data in this field. Conclusion: Centralizing and formalizing the representation of digital objects within a commons promotes FAIRness, enables its measurement over time and the identification of potentially interoperable combinations of data and software."
On the dynamics of an epidemic patch model with mass-action transmission mechanism and asymmetric dispersal patterns,2023-11-10 00:00:00,"Rachidi Salako, Yixiang Wu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06437,"This paper examines an epidemic patch model with mass-action transmission mechanism and asymmetric connectivity matrix. Results on the global dynamics of solutions and the spatial structures of endemic solutions are obtained. In particular, we show that when the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ is less than one and the dispersal rate of the susceptible population $d_S$ is large, the population would eventually stabilize at the disease-free equilibrium. However, the disease may persist if $d_S$ is small, even if $\mathcal{R}_0<1$. In such a scenario, explicit conditions on the model parameters that lead to the existence of multiple endemic equilibria are identified. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of infectious diseases in multi-patch environments. Moreover, results in [27], which is for the same model but with symmetric connectivity matrix, are generalized and improved."
On Optimal Control at the Onset of a New Viral Outbreak,2023-11-09 00:00:00,"Alexandra Smirnova, Xiaojing Ye",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05738,"An optimal control problem for the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak is considered. At that stage, control is often limited to non-medical interventions like social distancing and other behavioral changes. We show that the running cost of control satisfying mild, problem-specific, conditions generates an optimal control strategy that stays inside its admissible set for the entire duration of the study period $[0 ,T]$. For the optimal control problem, restricted by SIR compartmental model of disease transmission, we prove that the optimal control strategy, $u(t)$, may be growing until some moment $\bar{t} \in [0 ,T)$. However, for any $t \in [\bar{t}, T]$, the function $u(t)$ will decline as $t$ approaches $T$, which may cause the number of newly infected people to increase. So, the window from $0$ to $\bar{t}$ is the time for public health officials to prepare alternative mitigation measures, such as vaccines, testing, antiviral medications, and others. Our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical examples showing optimal control strategies for various cost functions and weights. Simulation results provide a comprehensive demonstration of the effects of control on the epidemic spread and mitigation expenses, which can serve as invaluable references for public health officials."
The context-specificity of virulence evolution revealed through evolutionary invasion analysis,2023-11-07 00:00:00,"Sudam Surasinghe, Ketty Kabengele, Paul E. Turner, C. Brandon Ogbunugafor",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04369,"Models are often employed to integrate knowledge about epidemics across scales and simulate disease dynamics. While these approaches have played a central role in studying the mechanics underlying epidemics, we lack ways to reliably predict how the relationship between virulence (the harm to hosts caused by an infection) and transmission will evolve in certain virus-host contexts. In this study, we invoke evolutionary invasion analysis -- a method used to identify the evolution of uninvadable strategies in dynamical systems -- to examine how the virulence-transmission dichotomy can evolve in models of virus infections defined by different natural histories. We reveal that peculiar ecologies drive different evolved relationships between virulence and transmission. Specifically, we discover patterns of virulence evolution between epidemics of various kinds (SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis C virus) and that varying definitions of virulence alter our predictions for how viruses will evolve. We discuss the findings in light of contemporary conversations in the public health sector around the possibility of predicting virus evolution and in more extensive theoretical discussions involving virulence evolution in emerging infectious diseases."
Prediction of viral spillover risk based on the mass action principle,2023-11-06 00:00:00,"Maryam Golchin, Moreno Di Marco, Paul Horwood, Dean Paini, Andrew Hoskins, R. I. Hickson",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03654,"Infectious zoonotic disease emergence, through spillover events, is of global concern and has the potential to cause significant harm to society, as recently demonstrated by COVID-19. More than 70% of the 400 infectious diseases that emerged in the past five decades have a zoonotic origin, including all recent pandemics. There have been several approaches used to predict the risk of spillover through some of the known or suspected infectious disease emergence drivers, largely using correlative approaches. Here, we predict the spatial distribution of spillover risk by approximating general transmission through animal and human interactions. These mass action interactions are approximated through the multiplication of the spatial distribution of zoonotic viral diversity and human population density. Although our results indicate higher risk in regions along the equator and in Southeast Asia where both viral diversity and human population density are high, it should be noted that this is primarily a conceptual exercise. We compared our spillover risk map to key factors, including the model inputs of zoonotic viral diversity estimate map, human population density map, and the spatial distribution of species richness. Despite the limitations of this approach, this viral spillover map is a step towards developing a more comprehensive spillover risk prediction system to inform global monitoring."
The Case for Controls: Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-control comparisons,2023-11-03 00:00:00,"Nina H. Fefferman, Michael J. Blum, Lydia Bourouiba, Nathaniel L.

We contend that case-control hypothesis testing is a more powerful framework for epidemiological investigation. The approach, widely used in medical research, involves identifying counterfactuals, with case-control comparisons drawn to test hypotheses about the conditions that manifest outbreaks. Here we outline the merits of applying a case-control framework as epidemiological study design. We first describe a framework for iterative multidisciplinary interrogation to discover minimally sufficient sets of factors that can lead to disease outbreaks. We then lay out how case-control comparisons can respectively center on pathogen(s), factor(s), or landscape(s) with vignettes focusing on pathogen transmission. Finally, we consider how adopting case-control approaches can promote evidence-based decision making for responding to and preventing outbreaks."

In the absence of effective vaccines, governments across the globe resorted to the implementation of lockdown measures as a vital strategy to mitigate the virus's relentless spread. While these restrictions were widely enforced, crucial sectors like public health and safety remained operational, ensuring the continuity of essential services. The timing and stringency of lockdown measures in various U.S. states were intricately tailored to the severity of the outbreak within their respective regions. Lockdowns effectively curtailed social interactions, thereby significantly reducing virus transmission. However, it is essential to strike a balance, as prolonged lockdowns can sow apprehension among the populace, impeding the resumption of normal social activities due to the persistent fear of contracting COVID-19. These prolonged restrictions have reverberated throughout the business landscape, resulting in reduced consumer and employee participation, ultimately denting long-term profitability sustainability. Businesses that lacked the resilience of adequate inventory faced the dire prospect of permanent closure. Regrettably, the absence of substantial government financial support has made business closure an all too common outcome, with the arduous task of revival to former employment levels."

Metagenomic analysis is crucial, for instance, in clinical applications such as infectious disease screening and the diagnosis and early detection of diseases such as cancer. A key task in metagenomics is to determine the species present in a sample and their relative abundances. Currently, the field is dominated by either alignment-based tools, which offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive, or alignment-free tools, which are fast but lack the needed accuracy for many applications. In response to this dichotomy, we introduce MetaFast, a tool based on heuristics, to achieve a fundamental improvement in accuracy-runtime tradeoff over existing methods. MetaFast delivers accuracy comparable to the alignment-based and highly accurate tool Metalign but with significantly enhanced efficiency. In MetaFast, we accelerate memory-frugal reference database indexing and filtering. We further employ heuristics to accelerate read mapping. Our evaluation demonstrates that MetaFast achieves a 4x speedup over Metalign without compromising accuracy. MetaFast is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/MetaFast."

Kinetic compartmental models driven by opinion dynamics: Vaccine hesitancy and social influence,2023-10-30 00:00:00,"Andrea Bondesan, Giuseppe Toscani, Mattia Zanella",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19601,"We propose a kinetic model for understanding the link between opinion formation phenomena and epidemic dynamics. The recent pandemic has brought to light that vaccine hesitancy can present different phases and temporal and spatial variations, presumably due to the different social features of individuals. The emergence of patterns in societal reactions permits to design and predict the trends of a pandemic. This suggests that the problem of vaccine hesitancy can be described in mathematical terms, by suitably coupling a kinetic compartmental model for the spreading of an infectious disease with the evolution of the personal opinion of individuals, in the presence of leaders. The resulting model makes it possible to predict the collective compliance with vaccination campaigns as the pandemic evolves and to highlight the best strategy to set up for maximizing the vaccination coverage. We conduct numerical investigations which confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena related to the spread of an epidemic."

To prevent TB from spreading within the body, which causes life-threatening complications, timely and effective anti-TB treatment is crucial. Cough, an objective biomarker for TB, is a triage tool that monitors treatment response and regresses with successful therapy. Current gold standards for TB diagnosis are slow or inaccessible, especially in rural areas where TB is most prevalent. In addition, current machine learning (ML) diagnosis research, like utilizing chest radiographs, is ineffective and does not monitor treatment progression. To enable effective diagnosis, an ensemble model was developed that analyzes, using a novel ML architecture, coughs' acoustic epidemiologies from smartphones' microphones to detect TB. The architecture includes a 2D-CNN and XGBoost that was trained on 724,964 cough audio samples and demographics from 7 countries. After feature extraction (Mel-spectrograms) and data augmentation (IR-convolution), the model achieved AUROC (area under the receiving operator characteristic) of 88%, surpassing WHO's requirements for screening tests. The results are available within 15 seconds and can easily be accessible via a mobile app. This research helps to improve TB diagnosis through a promising accurate, quick, and accessible triaging tool."
Learning COVID-19 Regional Transmission Using Universal Differential Equations in a SIR model,2023-11-03 00:00:00,"Adrian Rojas-Campos, Lukas Stelz, Pascal Nieters",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16804,"Highly-interconnected societies difficult to model the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Single-region SIR models fail to account for incoming forces of infection and expanding them to a large number of interacting regions involves many assumptions that do not hold in the real world. We propose using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to capture the influence of neighboring regions and improve the model's predictions in a combined SIR+UDE model. UDEs are differential equations totally or partially defined by a deep neural network (DNN). We include an additive term to the SIR equations composed by a DNN that learns the incoming force of infection from the other regions. The learning is performed using automatic differentiation and gradient descent to approach the change in the target system caused by the state of the neighboring regions. We compared the proposed model using a simulated COVID-19 outbreak against a single-region SIR and a fully data-driven model composed only of a DNN. The proposed UDE+SIR model generates predictions that capture the outbreak dynamic more accurately, but a decay in performance is observed at the last stages of the outbreak. The single-area SIR and the fully data-driven approach do not capture the proper dynamics accurately. Once the predictions were obtained, we employed the SINDy algorithm to substitute the DNN with a regression, removing the black box element of the model with no considerable increase in the error levels."
A Bayesian model calibration framework for stochastic compartmental models with both time-varying and time-invariant parameters,2023-11-04 00:00:00,"Brandon Robinson, Philippe Bisaillon, Jodi D. Edwards, Tetyana Kendzerska, Mohammad Khalil, Dominique Poirel, Abhijit Sarkar",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16169,"We consider state and parameter estimation for compartmental models having both time-varying and time-invariant parameters. Though the described Bayesian computational framework is general, we look at a specific application to the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model which describes a basic mechanism for the spread of infectious diseases through a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The SIR model consists of three states, namely, the three compartments, and two parameters which control the coupling among the states. The deterministic SIR model with time-invariant parameters has shown to be overly simplistic for modelling the complex long-term dynamics of diseases transmission. Recognizing that certain model parameters will naturally vary in time due to seasonal trends, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and other random effects, the estimation procedure must systematically permit these time-varying effects to be captured, without unduly introducing artificial dynamics into the system. To this end, we leverage the robustness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of time-invariant parameters alongside nonlinear filters for the joint estimation of the system state and time-varying parameters. We demonstrate performance of the framework by first considering a series of examples using synthetic data, followed by an exposition on public health data collected in the province of Ontario."

Extensive studies validate the understanding of larger (droplets) and smaller (aerosols) particles in disease transmission. Similarly, N95 respirators, and other forms of respiratory protection, have proven efficacy in reducing the risk of infection across various environments. Even though multiple studies confirm their protective effect when adopted in healthcare and public settings for infection prevention, studies on their adoption over the last several decades in both clinical trials and observational studies have not provided as clear an understanding. Here we show that the standard analytical equations used in the analysis of these studies do not accurately represent the random variables impacting study results. By correcting these equations, it is demonstrated that conclusions drawn from these studies are heavily biased and uncertain, providing little useful information. Despite these limitations, we show that when outcome measures are properly analyzed, existing results consistently point to the benefit of N95 respirators over medical masks, and masking over its absence. Correcting errors in widely reported meta-analyses also yields statistically significant estimates. These findings have important implications for study design and using existing evidence for infection control policy guidelines."

In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. In addition to sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation, we use neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and with ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms."
Infection Curve Flattening via Targeted Interventions and Self-Isolation,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Houman Zarrabi, Azam Doustmohammadian, Hamid R.

Particularly in this work, we study the impact of these network features on targeted intervention (e.g., self-isolation and quarantine). The targeted individuals for self-isolation are based on centrality measures and node influence metrics. Compared to our previous works on scale-free networks, small-world networks are considered in this paper. Small-world networks resemble real-world social and human networks. In this type of network, most nodes are not directly connected but can be reached through a few intermediaries (known as the small-worldness property). Real social networks, such as friendship networks, also exhibit this small-worldness property, where most people are connected through a relatively small number of intermediaries. We particularly study the epidemic curve flattening by centrality-based interventions/isolation over small-world networks. Our results show that high clustering while having low small-worldness (higher shortest path characteristics) implies flatter infection curves. In reality, a flatter infection curve implies that the number of new cases of a disease is spread out over a longer period of time, rather than a sharp and sudden increase in cases (a peak in epidemic). In turn, this reduces the strain on healthcare resources and helps to relieve the healthcare services."

Optimizing crop protection is urgently needed to ensure food safety. One aspect of crop protection is surveillance, which focuses on the early detection of a parasite, and control, aiming to fight and possibly eradicate it. Network theory has been widely used to model the spread of human and animal infectious diseases in systems described through nodes and edges. It has been successfully used to optimize monitoring and immunization campaigns. In crop protection, there is a growing literature using this theory to describe parasites spread and to conceive protection strategies. Here we review the use of network theory in crop protection, from the more descriptive to the more applied approaches aimed to optimize crop protection. We retrace the logical process that has led epidemiological models to rely on network theory, and we provide examples of how the spread of crop parasites has been represented via a network description. We define the objectives of surveillance and control, and we show how these have been declined in the network-based epidemiological sphere and then adapted in the agricultural context. We eventually discuss the discrepancy between the application of network theory in surveillance and control to identify culprits and solutions. We find that: i) scientists have successfully interpreted very different modes of parasitic transmission under the lens of network theory; ii) while network-based surveillance has progressively clarified its objectives and sound tools have been proposed, network-based control has been less studied and applied; iii) network-thinking must address how to properly define edges and nodes at different geographic scale to broad its application in crop protection."

Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics.

Our key independent variable is the presence of open-day events in a given region on a specific day. We analyzed the data using regression with fixed effects for time and region. The analysis was robust to alternative model specifications. Findings: We find that when an open day event was organized, in proportion to the eligible population, there was an average 0.39-0.44 percentage point increase in total doses administered and a 0.30-0.33 percentage point increase in first doses administered. These figures correspond to an average increase of 10,455-11,796 in total doses administered and 8,043-8,847 in the first doses administered. Interpretation: Releasing vaccines in limited quantities and at limited times by organizing open-day events was associated with an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations in most Italian regions. These results call for wider adoption of vaccination strategies based on the limited release of vaccines for other infectious diseases or future pandemics."
Paradoxes in the co-evolution of contagions and institutions,2023-10-09 00:00:00,"Jonathan St-Onge, Giulio Burgio, Samuel F. Rosenblatt, Timothy M. Waring, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03672,"Epidemic models study the spread of an undesired agent through a population, be it infectious diseases through a country, misinformation in online social media, or pests infesting a region. In combating these epidemics, we rely neither on global top-down interventions, nor solely on individual adaptations. Instead, interventions most commonly come from local institutions such as public health departments, moderation teams on social media platforms, or other forms of group governance. Classic models, which are often individual or agent-based, are ill-suited to capture local adaptations. We leverage recent development of institutional dynamics based on cultural group selection to study how groups can attempt local control of an epidemic by taking inspiration from the successes and failures of other groups. Incorporating these institutional changes into the epidemic dynamics reveals paradoxes: a higher transmission rate can result in smaller outbreaks and decreasing the speed of institutional adaptation generally reduces outbreak size. When groups perceive a contagion as more worrisome, they can invest in improved policies and, if they maintain these policies long enough to have impact, lead to a reduction in endemicity. By looking at the interplay between the speed of institutions and the transmission rate of the contagions, we find rich co-evolutionary dynamics that reflect the complexity of known biological and social contagions."
Impact of geography on the importance of parameters in infectious disease models,2023-10-20 00:00:00,"Arindam Saha, Maziar Ghorbani, Diana Suleimenova, Anastasia Anagnostou, Derek Groen",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02449,"Agent-based models are widely used to predict infectious disease spread. For these predictions, one needs to understand how each input parameter affects the result. Here, some parameters may affect the sensitivities of others, requiring the analysis of higher order coefficients through e.g. Sobol sensitivity analysis. The geographical structures of real-world regions are distinct in that they are difficult to reduce to single parameter values, making a unified sensitivity analysis intractable. Yet analyzing the importance of geographical structure on the sensitivity of other input parameters is important because a strong effect would justify the use of models with real-world geographical representations, as opposed to stylized ones."
Population dynamics model for aging,2023-09-29 00:00:00,"Jacques Demongeot, Pierre Magal",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17106,"The chronological age used in demography describes the linear evolution of the life of a living being. The chronological age cannot give precise information about the exact developmental stage or aging processes an organism has reached. On the contrary, the biological age (or epigenetic age) represents the true evolution of the tissues and organs of the living being. Biological age is not always linear and sometimes proceeds by discontinuous jumps. These jumps can be positive (we then speak of rejuvenation) or negative (in the event of premature aging), and they can be dependent on endogenous events such as pregnancy (negative jump) or stroke (positive jump) or exogenous ones such as surgical treatment (negative jump) or infectious disease (positive jump). The article proposes a mathematical model of the biological age by defining a valid model for the two types of jumps (positive and negative). The existence and uniqueness of the solution are solved, and its temporal dynamic is analyzed using a moments equation. We also provide some individual-based stochastic simulations."
Novel Discrete Composite Distributions with Applications to Infectious Disease Data,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Bowen Liu, Malwane M. A. Ananda",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16443,"It was observed that the number of cases and deaths for infectious diseases were associated with heavy-tailed power law distributions such as the Pareto distribution. While Pareto distribution was widely used to model the cases and deaths of infectious diseases, a major limitation of Pareto distribution is that it can only fit a given data set beyond a certain threshold. Thus, it can only model part of the data set. Thus, we proposed some novel discrete composite distributions with Pareto tails to fit the real infectious disease data. To provide necessary statistical inference for the tail behavior of the data, we developed a hypothesis testing procedure to test the tail index parameter. COVID-19 reported cases in Singapore and monkeypox reported cases in France were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the newly created distributions. The results from the analysis suggested that the discrete composite distributions could demonstrate competitive performance compared to the commonly used discrete distributions. Furthermore, the analysis of the tail index parameter can provide great insights into preventing and controlling infectious diseases."
AE-GPT: Using Large Language Models to Extract Adverse Events from Surveillance Reports-A Use Case with Influenza Vaccine Adverse Events,2023-09-27 00:00:00,"Yiming Li, Jianfu Li, Jianping He, Cui Tao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16150,"Though Vaccines are instrumental in global health, mitigating infectious diseases and pandemic outbreaks, they can occasionally lead to adverse events (AEs). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in effectively identifying and cataloging AEs within clinical reports. Utilizing data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 1990 to 2016, this study particularly focuses on AEs to evaluate LLMs' capability for AE extraction. A variety of prevalent LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3 variants, GPT-4, and Llama 2, were evaluated using Influenza vaccine as a use case. The fine-tuned GPT 3.5 model (AE-GPT) stood out with a 0.704 averaged micro F1 score for strict match and 0.816 for relaxed match. The encouraging performance of the AE-GPT underscores LLMs' potential in processing medical data, indicating a significant stride towards advanced AE detection, thus presumably generalizable to other AE extraction tasks."

The method was validated against COVID-19 surveillance data collected in Italy over an 18-month period. Compared to traditional methods, the nowcasted reproduction number reduced the estimation delay from 13 to 8 days, while maintaining a better accuracy. Moreover, it allowed anticipating the detection of periods of epidemic growth by between 6 and 23 days. The method offers a simple and generally applicable tool to improve situational awareness during an epidemic outbreak, allowing for informed public health response planning."
Leveraging Herpangina Data to Enhance Hospital-level Prediction of Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease Admissions Using UPTST,2023-10-06 00:00:00,"Guoqi Yu, Hailun Yao, Huan Zheng, Ximing Xu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14674,"Outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease(HFMD) have been associated with significant morbidity and, in severe cases, mortality. Accurate forecasting of daily admissions of pediatric HFMD patients is therefore crucial for aiding the hospital in preparing for potential outbreaks and mitigating nosocomial transmissions. To address this pressing need, we propose a novel transformer-based model with a U-net shape, utilizing the patching strategy and the joint prediction strategy that capitalizes on insights from herpangina, a disease closely correlated with HFMD. This model also integrates representation learning by introducing reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss. The results show that our U-net Patching Time Series Transformer (UPTST) model outperforms existing approaches in both long- and short-arm prediction accuracy of HFMD at hospital-level. Furthermore, the exploratory extension experiments show that the model's capabilities extend beyond prediction of infectious disease, suggesting broader applicability in various domains."
Can the natural system of viruses reconcile the current taxonomy with an alternative classification useful to clinicians?,2023-09-23 00:00:00,Alexandr A. Ezhov,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13419,"In 2022, a group of basic and clinical virologists, bioinformaticians, and evolutionary and structural biologists met in Oxford, UK, to develop a consensus on methodologies used to classify viruses. They concluded that virus taxonomy, which is hierarchical and based on evolution, is only one of many possible ways to classify viruses. This taxonomy, while satisfying the four principles they set out, faces difficulties in coordinating with other classification systems useful to clinicians, infectious disease specialists, agronomists, etc. One example discussed is the grouping of different viral strains that cause different diseases into the species Enterovirus C. Here we show that the use of a previously proposed variant of a natural virus classification system based on the use of Neural Replicator Analysis can resolve this contradiction by establishing the fine structure of the Enterovirus C species, in which strains that cause different diseases are placed in several different cells of the binomial table of viruses. A key element in enabling this is the sophisticated preprocessing of the original viral genomes using neural replicators."
Characterizing the temporally stable structure of community evolution in intra-urban origin-destination networks,2023-09-22 00:00:00,"Xiao-Jian Chen, Yuhui Zhao, Chaogui Kang, Xiaoyue Xing, Quanhua Dong, Yu Liu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12691,"Intra-urban origin-destination (OD) network communities evolve throughout the day, indicating changing groups of closely connected regions. Under this variation, groups of regions with high consistency of community affiliation characterize the temporally stable structure of the evolution process, aiding in comprehending urban dynamics. However, how to quantify this consistency and identify these groups are open questions. In this study, we introduce the consensus OD network to quantify the consistency of community affiliation among regions. Furthermore, the temporally stable community decomposition method is proposed to identify groups of regions with high internal and low external consistency (named ""stable groups""), where each group consists of temporally stable cores and attaching peripheries. Wuhan taxi data is used to verify our methods. On the hourly time scale, eleven stable groups containing 82.9% of regions are identified. This high percentage suggests that dynamic communities can be well organized via cores. Moreover, stable groups are spatially closed and more likely to distribute within a single district and separated by water bodies. Cores exhibit higher POI entropy and more healthcare and shopping services than peripheries. Our methods and empirical findings contribute to some practical issues, such as urban area division, polycentric evaluation and construction, and infectious disease control."
Analysis and Applications of Population Flows in a Networked SEIRS Epidemic Process,2023-09-20 00:00:00,"Brooks A. Butler, Raphael Stern, Philip E.

We provide sufficient conditions for local stability and instability of the healthy state of the system and show that no perturbation of population flows can change the local stability of any healthy state. We also provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an endemic state. We then develop tools and methods for applying our model to real-world data, including spreading parameter estimation and disease arrival time prediction, and apply them in a case study using both travel and infection data from counties in Minnesota during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Infection patterns in simple and complex contagion processes on networks,2023-09-19 00:00:00,"Diego Andrés Contreras, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10486,"Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the structure and intensity of the interactions between individuals. While it is well known that the network structure has a fundamental impact on how a spreading process unfolds, the reverse question is less investigated: do different processes unfolding on a given network substrate lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of spreading models of both simple and complex contagion processes. Specifically, we measure for each link of the network the probability that it is used in a contagion event and compare how these probabilities depend on the model used to describe the spreading process. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust against modifications of parameters and across models. In complex contagion models, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, we observe instead non-trivial dependencies with models parameters. When group interactions are taken into account, the infection pattern changes according to the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, it is sufficient to slightly modify the threshold to significantly impact the paths followed by the spread. Our results improve our understanding of contagion processes on networks, in particular with respect to the ability to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and with respect to the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature."

Voronoi Diagram tessellations, based on specific street network locations, outperform standard Census Block Group tessellations, and a hybrid approach balances accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarking against existing ABMs highlights key optimizations.

A Comparison between Markov Switching Zero-inflated and Hurdle Models for Spatio-temporal Infectious Disease Counts,2023-09-08 00:00:00,"Mingchi Xu, Dirk Douwes-Schultz, Alexandra M. Schmidt",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04594,"In epidemiological studies, zero-inflated and hurdle models are commonly used to handle excess zeros in reported infectious disease cases. However, they can not model the persistence (from presence to presence) and reemergence (from absence to presence) of a disease separately. Covariates can sometimes have different effects on the reemergence and persistence of a disease. Recently, a zero-inflated Markov switching negative binomial model was proposed to accommodate this issue. We present a Markov switching negative binomial hurdle model as a competitor of that approach, as hurdle models are often also used as alternatives to zero-inflated models for accommodating excess zeroes. We begin the comparison by inspecting the underlying assumptions made by both models. Hurdle models assume perfect detection of the disease cases while zero-inflated models implicitly assume the case counts can be under-reported, thus we investigate when a negative binomial distribution can approximate the true distribution of reported counts. A comparison of the fit of the two types of Markov switching models is undertaken on chikungunya cases across the neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We find that, among the fitted models, the Markov switching negative binomial zero-inflated model produces the best predictions and both Markov switching models produce remarkably better predictions than more traditional negative binomial hurdle and zero-inflated models."
Disposable face masks: a direct source for inhalation of microplastics,2023-08-30 00:00:00,"Andres F. Prada, Avram Distler, Shyuan Cheng, John W. Scott, Leonardo P.

However, the synthetic fibers, mainly made of polypropylene, used in their production may adversely affect the environment and human health. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of microplastics and fibers in human lungs and have related these synthetic particles with the occurrence of pulmonary ground glass nodules. Using a piston system to simulate human breathing, this study investigates the role of surgical masks as a direct source of inhalation of microplastics. Results reveal the release of particles of sizes ranging from nanometers (300 nm) to millimeters (~2 mm) during normal breathing conditions, raising concerns about the potential health risks. Notably, large visible particles (> 1 mm) were observed to be ejected from masks with limited wear after only a few breathing cycles. Given the widespread use of masks by healthcare workers and the potential future need for mask usage by the general population during seasonal infectious diseases or new pandemics, developing face masks using safe materials for both users and the environment is imperative."
MSGNN: Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network for Epidemic Forecasting,2023-08-30 00:00:00,"Mingjie Qiu, Zhiyi Tan, Bing-kun Bao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15840,"Infectious disease forecasting has been a key focus and proved to be crucial in controlling epidemic. A recent trend is to develop forecast-ing models based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNN-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) Current models broaden receptive fields by scaling the depth of GNNs, which is insuffi-cient to preserve the semantics of long-range connectivity between distant but epidemic related areas. (2) Previous approaches model epidemics within single spatial scale, while ignoring the multi-scale epidemic pat-terns derived from different scales. To address these deficiencies, we devise the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (MSGNN) based on an innovative multi-scale view. To be specific, in the proposed MSGNN model, we first devise a novel graph learning module, which directly captures long-range connectivity from trans-regional epidemic signals and integrates them into a multi-scale graph. Based on the learned multi-scale graph, we utilize a newly designed graph convolution module to exploit multi-scale epidemic patterns. This module allows us to facilitate multi-scale epidemic modeling by mining both scale-shared and scale-specific pat-terns. Experimental results on forecasting new cases of COVID-19 in United State demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-arts. Further analyses and visualization also show that MSGNN offers not only accurate, but also robust and interpretable forecasting result."
Semiparametric inference of effective reproduction number dynamics from wastewater pathogen surveillance data,2023-08-31 00:00:00,"Isaac H. Goldstein, Daniel M. Parker, Sunny Jiang, Volodymyr M. Minin",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15770,"Concentrations of pathogen genomes measured in wastewater have recently become available as a new data source to use when modeling the spread of infectious diseases. One promising use for this data source is inference of the effective reproduction number, the average number of individuals a newly infected person will infect. We propose a model where new infections arrive according to a time-varying immigration rate which can be interpreted as a compound parameter equal to the product of the proportion of susceptibles in the population and the transmission rate. This model allows us to estimate the effective reproduction number from concentrations of pathogen genomes while avoiding difficult to verify assumptions about the dynamics of the susceptible population. As a byproduct of our primary goal, we also produce a new model for estimating the effective reproduction number from case data using the same framework. We test this modeling framework in an agent-based simulation study with a realistic data generating mechanism which accounts for the time-varying dynamics of pathogen shedding. Finally, we apply our new model to estimating the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in Los Angeles, California, using pathogen RNA concentrations collected from a large wastewater treatment facility."
Generative Bayesian modeling to nowcast the effective reproduction number from line list data with missing symptom onset dates,2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Adrian Lison, Sam Abbott, Jana Huisman, Tanja Stadler",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13262,"The time-varying effective reproduction number $R_t$ is a widely used indicator of transmission dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Timely estimates of $R_t$ can be obtained from observations close to the original date of infection, such as the date of symptom onset. However, these data often have missing information and are subject to right truncation. Previous methods have addressed these problems independently by first imputing missing onset dates, then adjusting truncated case counts, and finally estimating the effective reproduction number. This stepwise approach makes it difficult to propagate uncertainty and can introduce subtle biases during real-time estimation due to the continued impact of assumptions made in previous steps. In this work, we integrate imputation, truncation adjustment, and $R_t$ estimation into a single generative Bayesian model, allowing direct joint inference of case counts and $R_t$ from line list data with missing symptom onset dates. We then use this framework to compare the performance of nowcasting approaches with different stepwise and generative components on synthetic line list data for multiple outbreak scenarios and across different epidemic phases. We find that under long reporting delays, intermediate smoothing, as is common practice in stepwise approaches, can bias nowcasts of case counts and $R_t$, which is avoided in a joint generative approach due to shared regularization of all model components. On incomplete line list data, a fully generative approach enables the quantification of uncertainty due to missing onset dates without the need for an initial multiple imputation step. In a real-world comparison using hospitalization line list data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, we observe the same qualitative differences between approaches. Our generative modeling components have been integrated into the R package epinowcast."

Ibrahim, Terry Lyons",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12840,"Through our respiratory system, many viruses and diseases frequently spread and pass from one person to another. Covid-19 served as an example of how crucial it is to track down and cut back on contacts to stop its spread. There is a clear gap in finding automatic methods that can detect hand-to-face contact in complex urban scenes or indoors. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision framework, called FaceTouch, based on deep learning. It comprises deep sub-models to detect humans and analyse their actions. FaceTouch seeks to detect hand-to-face touches in the wild, such as through video chats, bus footage, or CCTV feeds. Despite partial occlusion of faces, the introduced system learns to detect face touches from the RGB representation of a given scene by utilising the representation of the body gestures such as arm movement. This has been demonstrated to be useful in complex urban scenarios beyond simply identifying hand movement and its closeness to faces. Relying on Supervised Contrastive Learning, the introduced model is trained on our collected dataset, given the absence of other benchmark datasets. The framework shows a strong validation in unseen datasets which opens the door for potential deployment."
Optimal Dorfman Group Testing For Symmetric Distributions,2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Nicholas C. Landolfi, Sanjay Lall",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11050,"We study Dorfman's classical group testing protocol in a novel setting where individual specimen statuses are modeled as exchangeable random variables. We are motivated by infectious disease screening. In that case, specimens which arrive together for testing often originate from the same community and so their statuses may exhibit positive correlation. Dorfman's protocol screens a population of n specimens for a binary trait by partitioning it into nonoverlapping groups, testing these, and only individually retesting the specimens of each positive group. The partition is chosen to minimize the expected number of tests under a probabilistic model of specimen statuses. We relax the typical assumption that these are independent and indentically distributed and instead model them as exchangeable random variables. In this case, their joint distribution is symmetric in the sense that it is invariant under permutations. We give a characterization of such distributions in terms of a function q where q(h) is the marginal probability that any group of size h tests negative. We use this interpretable representation to show that the set partitioning problem arising in Dorfman's protocol can be reduced to an integer partitioning problem and efficiently solved. We apply these tools to an empirical dataset from the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology helps explain the unexpectedly high empirical efficiency reported by the original investigators."
Incorporating Connectivity among Internet Search Data for Enhanced Influenza-like Illness Tracking,2023-08-19 00:00:00,"Shaoyang Ning, Ahmed Hussain, Qing Wang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10091,"Big data collected from the Internet possess great potential to reveal the ever-changing trends in society.

To this end, we propose ARGO-C (Augmented Regression with Clustered GOogle data), an integrative, statistically principled approach that incorporates the clustering structure of Internet search data to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of disease tracking. Focusing on multi-resolution %ILI (influenza-like illness) tracking, we demonstrate the improved performance and robustness of ARGO-C over benchmark methods at various geographical resolutions.

We model the VL trajectory by a multivariate normal distribution that accounts for possible correlation between measurements within individuals. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which treats the unknown time origins and the missing measurements as latent variables. Our main motivation is the reconstruction of the daily mean SARS-Cov-2 VL, given measurements performed on random patients, whose VL was measured multiple times on different days. The method is applied to SARS-Cov-2 cycle-threshold-value data collected in Israel."
Evolution of priorities in strategic funding for collaborative health research. A comparison of the European Union Framework Programmes to the program funding by the United States National Institutes of Health,2023-08-14 00:00:00,"David Fajardo-Ortiz, Bart Thijs, Wolfgang Glanzel, Karin R.

We investigated the impact of this trend on health research funded by the two leading funding bodies worldwide, i.e. the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and the framework programs of the European Union (EU). To this end, we performed a quantitative analysis of the content of projects supported through programmatic funding by the EU and NIH, in the period 2008-2014 and 2015-2020. We used machine learning for classification of projects as basic biomedical research, or as more implementation directed clinical therapeutic research, diagnostics research, population research, or policy and management research. In addition, we analyzed funding for major disease areas (cancer, cardio-metabolic and infectious disease). We found that EU collaborative health research projects clearly shifted towards more implementation research. In the US, the recently implemented UM1 program has a similar profile with strong clinical therapeutic research, while other NIH programs remain heavily oriented to basic biomedical research. Funding for cancer research is present across all NIH and EU programs, and in biomedical as well as more implementation directed projects, while infectious diseases is an emerging theme. We conclude that demand for solutions for medical needs leads to expanded funding for implementation- and impact-oriented research. Basic biomedical research remains present in programs driven by scientific initiative and strategies based on excellence, but may be at risk of declining funding opportunities."
Dual fear phenomenon in an eco-epidemiological model with prey aggregation,2023-08-13 00:00:00,"Kwadwo Antwi-Fordjour, Sarah P. Westmoreland, Kendall H.

We establish criteria for determining the existence of equilibrium points, which carry substantial biological significance. We establish the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf, saddle-node, and transcritical bifurcations by employing fear parameters as key bifurcation parameters. Furthermore, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the occurrence of multiple zero-Hopf (ZH) and saddle-node transcritical (SNTC) bifurcations around the endemic steady states by varying specific key parameters across the two-parametric plane. We demonstrate that the introduction of predator-induced fear, which hinders the growth rate of susceptible prey, can lead to the finite time extinction of an initially stable susceptible prey population. Finally, we discuss management strategies aimed at regulating disease transmission, focusing on fear-based interventions and selective predation via predator attack rate on infectious prey."
Clustering and Predicting Multiple Time Series Count Data via Mixture of Bayesian Predictive Syntheses: Analysis of COVID-19 Hospitalisation in Japan and Korea,2023-08-11 00:00:00,"Genya Kobayashi, Shonosuke Sugasawa, Yuki Kawakubo, Dongu Han, Taeryon Choi",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06134,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments and academia have made tremendous efforts to predict the course of the pandemic and implement prevention measures by monitoring various indicators. These indicators are obtained daily or weekly, and typically constitute time series count data over multiple sub-regions of a country, where groups of sub-regions often exhibit similar dynamics. This paper proposes a novel methodology called the mixture of Bayesian predictive syntheses (MBPS) to improve the predictive performance for such data by combining a set of predictive models and clustering the time series based on the contribution of those predictive models. MBPS takes the form of a finite mixture of dynamic factor models and is particularly useful when the multiple time series are discrete, as MBPS does not require multivariate count models, which are generally cumbersome to develop and implement. The clustering through MBPS provides valuable insights into the data and improves predictive performance by leveraging the share information within each cluster. Grouping multiple series into clusters also reduces the number of parameters needed compared to employing a multivariate model. To validate its efficacy, we apply the model to analyse the data on the numbers of COVID-19 inpatients and isolated individuals in Japan and Korea. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the agent methods in predictive accuracy. Moreover, the insights gained from our model provide valuable information for interpreting and diagnosing the analysis, contributing to the formulation of preventive measures for infectious diseases in the future."
Machine Learning for Infectious Disease Risk Prediction: A Survey,2023-08-06 00:00:00,"Mutong Liu, Yang Liu, Jiming Liu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03037,"Infectious diseases, either emerging or long-lasting, place numerous people at risk and bring heavy public health burdens worldwide. In the process against infectious diseases, predicting the epidemic risk by modeling the disease transmission plays an essential role in assisting with preventing and controlling disease transmission in a more effective way. In this paper, we systematically describe how machine learning can play an essential role in quantitatively characterizing disease transmission patterns and accurately predicting infectious disease risks. First, we introduce the background and motivation of using machine learning for infectious disease risk prediction. Next, we describe the development and components of various machine learning models for infectious disease risk prediction. Specifically, existing models fall into three categories: Statistical prediction, data-driven machine learning, and epidemiology-inspired machine learning. Subsequently, we discuss challenges encountered when dealing with model inputs, designing task-oriented objectives, and conducting performance evaluation. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open questions and future directions."
Virucidal Efficacy of Laser-Generated Copper Nanoparticle Coatings Against Model Coronavirus and Herpesvirus,2023-07-28 00:00:00,"Shahd Bakhet, Rasa Mardosaitė, Mohamed Ahmed Baba, Asta Tamulevičienė, Brigita Abakevičienė, Tomas Klinavičius, Kristupas Dagilis, Simas Račkauskas, Sigitas Tamulevičius, Raimundas Lelešius, Dainius Zienius, Algirdas Šalomskas, Tomas Tamulevičius",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02404,"High-efficiency antiviral surfaces can be effective means to fight against viral diseases such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Copper and copper oxides, as well as their nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and coatings, are among the effective antiviral materials having internal and external biocidal effects on viruses. In this work, stable Cu NP colloids were produced via femtosecond laser ablation of the metal target in water containing sodium citrate. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that the 32 nm mean size nanoparticles are mixtures of mainly metallic copper and copper (I) oxide Cu2O. Polyvinyl butyral was utilized as the binding agent for the spray-coated Cu NPs. The virucidal efficacy of such coatings containing different Cu content ranging from 2.9 at.% to 11.2 at.%. was confirmed against animal-origin coronavirus containing RNA, the agent of avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), and herpesvirus containing DNA, the agent of bovine herpesvirus (BoHV-1) infection. It was demonstrated that after a short time of exposure, the Cu NPs-based coatings do not have a toxic effect on the cell cultures while demonstrating a negative effect on the biological activity of both model viruses that was confirmed by quantification of the viruses via the determination of tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) virus titre and their viral nucleic acids via determination of threshold cycle (Ct) employing real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The assays showed that the decrease in TCID50 virus titre and increase in Ct values correlated with Cu content in Cu NPs-based coatings for both investigated viruses. Contact with coatings decreased IBV and BoHV-1 numbers from 99.42% to 100.00% and from 98.65% to 99.96% respectively. These findings suggest that Cu NPs show inhibitory effects leading to the inactivation of viruses and their nuclei regardless of the presence of a viral envelope."
Quantifying the spread of communicable diseases with immigration of infectious individuals,2023-08-03 00:00:00,"Sofía Guarello, Pablo Aguirre, Isabel Flores",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01988,"We construct a set of new epidemiological thresholds to address the general problem of spreading and containment of a disease with influx of infected individuals when the classic $\mathcal R_0$ is no longer meaningful. We provide analytical properties of these indices and illustrate their usefulness in a compartmental model of COVID-19 with data taken from Chile showing a good predictive potential when contrasted with the recorded disease behaviour. This approach and the associated analytical and numerical results allow us to quantify the severity of an immigration of infectious individuals into a community, and identification of the key parameters that are capable of changing or reversing the spread of an infectious disease in specific models."
A Framework for Incorporating Behavioural Change into Individual-Level Spatial Epidemic Models,2023-08-01 00:00:00,"Madeline A. Ward, Rob Deardon, Lorna E. Deeth",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00815,"During epidemics, people will often modify their behaviour patterns over time in response to changes in their perceived risk of spreading or contracting the disease. This can substantially impact the trajectory of the epidemic. However, most infectious disease models assume stable population behaviour due to the challenges of modelling these changes. We present a flexible new class of models, called behavioural change individual-level models (BC-ILMs), that incorporate both individual-level covariate information and a data-driven behavioural change effect. Focusing on spatial BC-ILMs, we consider four ""alarm"" functions to model the effect of behavioural change as a function of infection prevalence over time. We show how these models can be estimated in a simulation setting. We investigate the impact of misspecifying the alarm function when fitting a BC-ILM, and find that if behavioural change is present in a population, using an incorrect alarm function will still result in an improvement in posterior predictive performance over a model that assumes stable population behaviour. We also find that using spike and slab priors on alarm function parameters is a simple and effective method to determine whether a behavioural change effect is present in a population. Finally, we show results from fitting spatial BC-ILMs to data from the 2001 U.K. foot and mouth disease epidemic."
The contact process with an asymptomatic state,2023-08-01 00:00:00,"Nicolas Lanchier, Max Mercer",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00731,"In order to understand the role of a potentially high infectiousness of symptomatic individuals or, on the contrary, social distancing, quarantine, etc. in the course of an infectious disease, this paper introduces a natural variant of the popular contact process that distinguishes between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Infected individuals all recover at rate one but infect nearby individuals at a rate that depends on whether they show the symptoms of the disease or not. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and may or may not show the symptoms before they recover. The analysis of the corresponding mean-field model reveals that, in the absence of local interactions, regardless of the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, there is an epidemic whenever at least one of the infection rates is sufficiently large. In contrast, our analysis of the interacting particle system shows that, when the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic and the rate at which asymptomatic individuals infect nearby individuals are small, there cannot be any epidemic even when symptomatic individuals are highly infectious."

To study the spread of such infectious diseases it is important to not only understand their temporal evolution but also the spatial evolution. In this work, the spread of this disease has been studied with a cellular automata (CA) model to find the temporal and the spatial behavior of it. Here, we have proposed a neighborhood criteria which will help us to measure the social confinement at the time of the disease spread. The two main parameters of our model are (i) disease transmission probability (q) which helps us to measure the infectivity of a disease and (ii) exponent (n) which helps us to measure the degree of the social confinement. Here, we have studied various spatial growths of the disease by simulating this CA model. Finally we have tried to fit our model with the COVID-19 data of India for various waves and have attempted to match our model predictions with regards to each wave to see how the different parameters vary with respect to infectivity and restrictions in social interaction."

We have used the well-known SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) model of Kermack & McKendrick to extend the analysis further by including exposure, quarantining, insusceptibility and deaths in a SEIQRDP model.

A Switching State-Space Transmission Model for Tracking Epidemics and Assessing Interventions,2023-07-30 00:00:00,"Jingxue Feng, Liangliang Wang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16138,"The effective control of infectious diseases relies on accurate assessment of the impact of interventions, which is often hindered by the complex dynamics of the spread of disease. We propose a Beta-Dirichlet switching state-space transmission model to track underlying dynamics of disease and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions simultaneously. As time evolves, the switching mechanism introduced in the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model is able to capture the timing and magnitude of changes in the transmission rate due to the effectiveness of control measures. The implementation of this model is based on a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which can estimate the time evolution of SEIR states, switching states, and high-dimensional parameters efficiently. The efficacy of our model and estimation procedure are demonstrated through simulation studies. With a real-world application to British Columbia's COVID-19 outbreak, it indicates approximately a 66.6\% reduction of transmission rate following interventions such as distancing, closures and vaccination. Our proposed model provides a promising tool to inform public health policies aimed at studying the underlying dynamics and evaluating of the effectiveness of interventions during the spread of the disease."

Simulating the spread of COVID-19 with cellular automata: A new approach,2023-07-26 00:00:00,"Sourav Chowdhury, Suparna Roychowdhury, Indranath Chaudhuri",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14576,"Between the years 2020 to 2022, the world was hit by the pandemic of COVID-19 giving rise to an extremely grave situation. The global economy was badly hurt due to the consequences of various intervention strategies (like social distancing, lockdown) which were applied by different countries to control this pandemic. There are multiple speculations that humanity will again face such pandemics in the future. Thus it is very important to learn and gain knowledge about the spread of such infectious diseases and the various factors which are responsible for it. In this study, we have extended our previous work (Chowdhury et.al., 2022) on the probabilistic cellular automata (CA) model to reproduce the spread of COVID-19 in several countries by modifying its earlier used neighbourhood criteria. This modification gives us the liberty to adopt the effect of different restrictions like lockdown and social distancing in our model. We have done some theoretical analysis for initial infection and simulations to gain insights into our model. We have also studied the data from eight countries for COVID-19 in a window of 876 days and compared it with our model. We have developed a proper framework to fit our model on the data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 and have also re-checked the goodness of the fit with the data of the deceased cases for this pandemic. This model fits well with different peaks of COVID-19 data for all the eight countries and can be possibly generalized for a global prediction."
Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be biased in spatially structured populations,2023-07-25 00:00:00,"Piero Birello, Michele Re Fiorentin, Boxuan Wang, Vittoria Colizza, Eugenio Valdano",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13798,"An accurate and timely estimate of the reproduction ratio R of an infectious disease epidemic is crucial to make projections on its evolution and set up the appropriate public health response. Estimates of R routinely come from statistical inference on timelines of cases or their proxies like symptomatic cases, hospitalizatons, deaths. Here, however, we prove that these estimates of R may not be accurate if the population is made up of spatially distinct communities, as the interplay between space and mobility may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. This means that surveillance may underestimate R over long periods, to the point of mistaking a growing epidemic for a subsiding one, misinforming public health response. To overcome this, we propose a correction to be applied to surveillance data that removes this bias and ensures an accurate estimate of R across all epidemic phases. We use COVID-19 as case study; our results, however, apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation, including major challenges of the next decades: respiratory infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, emerging pathogens), vector-borne diseases (arboviruses). Our findings will help set up public health response to these threats, by improving epidemic monitoring and surveillance."

To study statistical properties of transmission intervals, we analyze a COVID-19 dataset of confirmed cases in Republic of Korea that has been collected for two years since the confirmation of the first case on 19 January 2020. Utilizing demographic information of confirmed individuals, such as sex, age, residence location, and the nature of relation between infectors and infectees, we find that transmission intervals are rarely affected by sexes, but they tend to have larger values for the youngest and oldest age groups than other groups. We also find some metropolitan cities or provinces with relatively larger (smaller) transmission intervals than other locations. These empirical findings might help us to better understand dynamical mechanisms of epidemic processes in complex social systems."
Limited efficacy of forward contact tracing in epidemics,2023-10-18 00:00:00,"Giulia de Meijere, Claudio Castellano",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11506,"Infectious diseases that spread silently through asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections represent a challenge for policy makers. A traditional way of achieving isolation of silent infectors from the community is through forward contact tracing, aiming at identifying individuals that might have been infected by a known infected person. In this work we investigate how efficient this measure is in preventing a disease from becoming endemic. We introduce an SIS-based compartmental model where symptomatic individuals may self-isolate and trigger a contact tracing process aimed at quarantining asymptomatic infected individuals. Imperfect adherence and delays affect both measures. We derive the epidemic threshold analytically and find that contact tracing alone can only lead to a very limited increase of the threshold. We quantify the effect of imperfect adherence and the impact of incentivizing asymptomatic and symptomatic populations to adhere to isolation. Our analytical results are confirmed by simulations on complex networks and by the numerical analysis of a much more complex model incorporating more realistic in-host disease progression."
SecureTrack- A contact tracing IoT platform for monitoring infectious diseases,2023-07-18 00:00:00,"Shobhit Aggarwal, Arnab Purkayastha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10311,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for innovative solutions to monitor and control the spread of infectious diseases. With the potential for future pandemics and the risk of outbreaks particularly in academic institutions, there is a pressing need for effective approaches to monitor and manage such diseases. Contact tracing using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) has been found to be the most prevalent method to detect and tackle the extent of outbreaks during the pandemic. However, these services suffer from the inherent problems of infringement of data privacy that creates hindrance in adoption of the technology. Non-cellular wireless technologies on the other hand are well-suited to provide secure contact tracing methods. Such approaches integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) have a great potential to aid in the fight against any type of infectious diseases. In response, we present a unique approach that utilizes an IoT based generic framework to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, using contact tracing methods, without compromising the privacy aspect. We develop the architecture of our platform, including both the frontend and backend components, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying potential COVID-19 exposures (as a test case) through a proof-of-concept implementation. We also implement and verify a prototype of the device. Our framework is easily deployable and can be scaled up as needed with the existing infrastructure."
Toward a comprehensive system for constructing compartmental epidemic models,2023-07-18 00:00:00,"Darren Flynn-Primrose, Steven C. Walker, Michael Li, Benjamin M. Bolker, David J. D.

Researchers building such models typically begin with a simple structure where compartments correspond to individuals with different epidemiological statuses, e.g., the classic SIR model which splits the population into susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments. However, as more information about a specific pathogen is discovered, or as a means to investigate the effects of heterogeneities, it becomes useful to stratify models further -- for example by age, geographic location, or pathogen strain. The operation of constructing stratified compartmental models from a pair of simpler models resembles the Cartesian product used in graph theory, but several key differences complicate matters. In this article we give explicit mathematical definitions for several so-called ``model products'' and provide examples where each is suitable. We also provide examples of model stratification where no existing model product will generate the desired result."
A Look into Causal Effects under Entangled Treatment in Graphs: Investigating the Impact of Contact on MRSA Infection,2023-07-17 00:00:00,"Jing Ma, Chen Chen, Anil Vullikanti, Ritwick Mishra, Gregory Madden, Daniel Borrajo, Jundong Li",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08237,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of bacteria resistant to certain antibiotics, making it difficult to prevent MRSA infections. Among decades of efforts to conquer infectious diseases caused by MRSA, many studies have been proposed to estimate the causal effects of close contact (treatment) on MRSA infection (outcome) from observational data. In this problem, the treatment assignment mechanism plays a key role as it determines the patterns of missing counterfactuals -- the fundamental challenge of causal effect estimation. Most existing observational studies for causal effect learning assume that the treatment is assigned individually for each unit. However, on many occasions, the treatments are pairwisely assigned for units that are connected in graphs, i.e., the treatments of different units are entangled. Neglecting the entangled treatments can impede the causal effect estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of causal effect estimation with treatment entangled in a graph. Despite a few explorations for entangled treatments, this problem still remains challenging due to the following challenges: (1) the entanglement brings difficulties in modeling and leveraging the unknown treatment assignment mechanism; (2) there may exist hidden confounders which lead to confounding biases in causal effect estimation; (3) the observational data is often time-varying. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method NEAT, which explicitly leverages the graph structure to model the treatment assignment mechanism, and mitigates confounding biases based on the treatment assignment modeling. We also extend our method into a dynamic setting to handle time-varying observational data. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world MRSA dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and provide insights for future applications."
Nowcasting Temporal Trends Using Indirect Surveys,2023-12-14 00:00:00,"Ajitesh Srivastava, Juan Marcos Ramírez, Sergio Díaz-Aranda, Jose Aguilar, Antonio Ortega, Antonio Fernández Anta, Rosa Elvira Lillo",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06643,"Indirect surveys, in which respondents provide information about other people they know, have been proposed for estimating (nowcasting) the size of a \emph{hidden population} where privacy is important or the hidden population is hard to reach. Examples include estimating casualties in an earthquake, conditions among female sex workers, and the prevalence of drug use and infectious diseases. The Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) is the classical approach to developing estimates from indirect surveys, but it was designed for one-shot surveys. Further, it requires certain assumptions and asking for or estimating the number of individuals in each respondent's network. In recent years, surveys have been increasingly deployed online and can collect data continuously (e.g., COVID-19 surveys on Facebook during much of the pandemic). Conventional NSUM can be applied to these scenarios by analyzing the data independently at each point in time, but this misses the opportunity of leveraging the temporal dimension. We propose to use the responses from indirect surveys collected over time and develop analytical tools (i) to prove that indirect surveys can provide better estimates for the trends of the hidden population over time, as compared to direct surveys and (ii) to identify appropriate temporal aggregations to improve the estimates. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that our approach outperforms traditional NSUM and direct surveying methods. We also empirically demonstrate the superiority of our approach on a real indirect survey dataset of COVID-19 cases."
COVID-19 incidence in the Republic of Ireland: A case study for network-based time series models,2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Stephanie Armbruster, Gesine Reinert",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06199,"Network-based Time Series models have experienced a surge in popularity over the past years due to their ability to model temporal and spatial dependencies such as arising from the spread of an infectious disease. As statistical models for network time series, generalised network autoregressive (GNAR) models have been introduced. GNAR models are vertex-based models which have an autoregressive component modelling temporal dependence and a spatial autoregressive component to incorporate dependence between neighbouring vertices in the network. This paper compares the performance of GNAR models with different underlying networks in predicting COVID-19 cases for the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland. The dataset is separated into subsets according to inter-country movement regulations and categorized into two pandemic phases, restricted and unrestricted. Ten static networks are constructed based on either general or COVID-19 specific approaches. In these networks, vertices represent counties, and edges are built upon neighbourhood relations, such as railway lines. We find that while for the prediction task, no underlying static network is consistently superior for either restricted or unrestricted phase, for pandemic phases with restrictions sparse networks perform better while for unrestricted phases, dense networks explain the data better. GNAR models have higher predictive accuracy than ARIMA models, which ignore the network structure. ARIMA and GNAR models perform similarly in pandemic phases with more lenient or no COVID-19 regulation. These findings indicate evidence of network dependencies in the restricted phase, but not in the unrestricted phase. They also show some robustness regarding the network construction method. An analysis of the residuals justifies the model assumptions for the restricted phase but raises questions for the unrestricted phase."
Analysis of a competitive respiratory disease system with quarantine,2023-07-11 00:00:00,"Anna Daniel Fome, Wolfgang Bock, Axel Klar",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05044,"In the world of epidemics, the mathematical modeling of disease co-infection is gaining importance due to its contributions to mathematics and public health. Because the co-infection may have a double burden on families, countries, and the universe, understanding its dynamics is paramount. We study a SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered) deterministic epidemic model with a single host population and multiple strains (-$c$ and -$i$) to account for two competitive diseases with quarantine effects. To model the role of quarantine and isolation efficacy in disease dynamics, we utilize a linear function. Further, we shed light on the standard endemic threshold and determine the conditions for extinction or coexistence with and without forming co-infection. Next, we show the dependence of the criticality based on specific parameters of the different pathogens. We found that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the single-strain model always exists and is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) if $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_k^q\leq 1$, else, a stable endemic equilibrium. On top of that, the model has forward bifurcation at $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_k^q = 1$. In the case of a two-strain model, the strain with a large reproduction number outcompetes the one with a smaller reproduction number. Further, if the co-infected quarantine reproduction number is less than one, the infections of already infected individuals will die out, and co-infection will persist in the population otherwise. We note that the quarantine and isolation of exposed and infected individuals will reduce the number of secondary cases below one, consequently reducing the disease complications if the total number of people in the quarantine is at most the critical value."
Predicting Tuberculosis from Real-World Cough Audio Recordings and Metadata,2023-07-12 00:00:00,"George P. Kafentzis, Stephane Tetsing, Joe Brew, Lola Jover, Mindaugas Galvosas, Carlos Chaccour, Peter M. Small",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04842,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs, as well as other body parts. TB is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Medical doctors diagnose TB in patients via clinical examinations and specialized tests. However, coughing is a common symptom of respiratory diseases such as TB. Literature suggests that cough sounds coming from different respiratory diseases can be distinguished by both medical doctors and computer algorithms. Therefore, cough recordings associated with patients with and without TB seems to be a reasonable avenue of investigation. In this work, we utilize a very large dataset of TB and non-TB cough audio recordings obtained from the south-east of Africa, India, and the south-east of Asia using a fully automated phone-based application (Hyfe), without manual annotation. We fit statistical classifiers based on spectral and time domain features with and without clinical metadata. A stratified grouped cross-validation approach shows that an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of approximately 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 both for a cough-level and a participant-level classification can be achieved using cough sounds alone. The addition of demographic and clinical factors increases performance, resulting in an average AUC of approximately 0.81 $\pm$ 0.05. Our results suggest mobile phone-based applications that integrate clinical symptoms and cough sound analysis could help community health workers and, most importantly, health service programs to improve TB case-finding efforts while reducing costs, which could substantially improve public health."
The strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity,2023-07-10 00:00:00,"Takayuki Hiraoka, Abbas K. Rizi, Zahra Ghadiri, Mikko Kivelä, Jari Saramäki",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700,"When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the risk of widespread outbreaks decreases non-linearly as a result of the collective protection known as herd immunity. Typically, immunity to a disease can be acquired through natural infection or vaccination. It has been argued that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce a stronger herd immunity effect than homogeneous vaccination, because the early stages of transmission would primarily affect highly interactive individuals, leading to more efficient suppression of subsequent infections. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the herd immunity effect by analyzing the behavior of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on static contact networks. We find that the effectiveness of disease-induced herd immunity is shaped by two competing mechanisms: While it exploits degree heterogeneity in the contact network to efficiently target highly connected individuals for immunity, it also introduces mixing heterogeneity between immune and susceptible individuals, weakening herd immunity. By controlling the degree of spatial embeddedness of the contact network structure, we find that spatial structure generally makes herd immunity stronger and also enhances the advantage of the herd immunity effect induced by random immunization over the disease-induced one in networks with low degree heterogeneity. These findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of herd immunity and have implications for designing effective disease control strategies."

This research uniquely delves into the varied efficacy of existing vaccines and the pivotal role of vaccination timing in the context of COVID-19. Departing from conventional modeling, we introduce two models that account for the impact of vaccines on infections, reinfections, and deaths. Recognizing the intricacy of these models, we use the Bayesian framework and specifically utilize the Metropolis-Hastings Sampler for estimation of model parameters. The study conducts scenario analyses on two models, quantifying the duration during which the healthcare system in Qatar could have potentially been overwhelmed by an influx of new COVID-19 cases surpassing the available hospital beds. Additionally, the research explores similarities in predictive probability distributions of cumulative infections, reinfections, and deaths, employing the Hellinger distance metric. Comparative analysis, employing the Bayes factor, underscores the plausibility of a model assuming a different susceptibility rate to reinfection, as opposed to assuming the same susceptibility rate for both infections and reinfections. Results highlight the adverse outcomes associated with delayed vaccination, emphasizing the efficacy of early vaccination in reducing infections, reinfections, and deaths. Our research advocates prioritizing early vaccination as a key strategy in effectively combating future pandemics. This study contributes vital insights for evidence-based public health interventions, providing clarity on vaccination strategies and reinforcing preparedness for challenges posed by infectious diseases.

Evaluating infectious disease forecasts with allocation scoring rules,2023-12-23 00:00:00,"Aaron Gerding, Nicholas G. Reich, Benjamin Rogers, Evan L. Ray",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16201,"Recent years have seen increasing efforts to forecast infectious disease burdens, with a primary goal being to help public health workers make informed policy decisions. However, there has only been limited discussion of how predominant forecast evaluation metrics might indicate the success of policies based in part on those forecasts. We explore one possible tether between forecasts and policy: the allocation of limited medical resources so as to minimize unmet need. We use probabilistic forecasts of disease burden in each of several regions to determine optimal resource allocations, and then we score forecasts according to how much unmet need their associated allocations would have allowed. We illustrate with forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US, and we find that the forecast skill ranking given by this allocation scoring rule can vary substantially from the ranking given by the weighted interval score. We see this as evidence that the allocation scoring rule detects forecast value that is missed by traditional accuracy measures and that the general strategy of designing scoring rules that are directly linked to policy performance is a promising direction for epidemic forecast evaluation."

This trade-off is characterized by the dilemma between stricter measures, which may effectively reduce infections but impose less educational benefit (more in-person interactions), and more lenient policies, which could lead to higher infection rates."
The Effect of Vaccination on the Competitive Advantage of Two Strains of an Infectious Disease,2023-12-22 00:00:00,"Matthew D. Johnston, Bruce Pell, Jared Pemberton, David A. Rubel",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14997,"We investigate how a population's natural and vaccine immunity affects the competitive balance between two strains of an infectious disease with different epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case where one strain is more transmissible and the other strain is more immune-resistant. The competition of these strains is modeled by two SIR-type models which incorporate waning natural immunity and which have distinct mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Waning immunity is implemented as a gamma-distributed delay, which is analyzed using the linear chain trick to transform the delay differential equation systems into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our analysis shows that vaccination has a significant effect on the competitive balance between two strains, potentially leading to dramatic flips from one strain dominating in the population to the other. We also show that which strain gains an advantage as a population's immunity level increases depends upon the integration between the mechanisms of natural and vaccine immunity. The results of this paper are consequently relevant for public policy."
Explosive epidemic transitions induced by quarantine fatigue,2023-12-22 00:00:00,L. D. Valdez,https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14703,"Quarantine measures are one of the first lines of defense against the spread of infectious diseases. However, maintaining these measures over extended periods can be challenging due to a phenomenon known as quarantine fatigue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of quarantine fatigue on the spread of infectious diseases by using an epidemic model on random networks with cliques. In our model, susceptible individuals can be quarantined up to $n$ times, after which they stop complying with quarantine orders due to fatigue. Our results show that quarantine fatigue may induce a regime in which increasing the probability of detecting and isolating infected individuals (along with their close contacts) could subsequently increase the expected number of cases at the end of an outbreak. Moreover, we observe that quarantine fatigue can trigger an abrupt phase transition at the critical reproduction number $R_0=1$. Finally, we explore a scenario where a non-negligible number of individuals are infected at the beginning of an epidemic, and our results show that, depending on the value of $n$, an abrupt transition between a controlled epidemic and a large epidemic event can occur for $R_0<1$."
Spatiotemporal risk prediction for infectious disease spread and mortality,2023-12-05 00:00:00,"Catherine Li, Daniel Lazarev",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14165,"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, various studies have focused on predicting the trajectory and risk factors of the virus and its variants. Building on previous work that addressed this problem using genetic and epidemiological data, we introduce a method, Geo Score, that also incorporates geographic, socioeconomic, and demographic data to estimate infection and mortality risk by region and time. We employ gradient descent to find the optimal weights of the factors' significance in determining risk. Such spatiotemporal risk prediction is important for informed public health decision-making so that individuals are aware of the risks of travel during an epidemic or pandemic, and, perhaps more importantly, so that policymakers know how to triage limited resources during a crisis. We apply our method to New York City COVID-19 data from 2020, predicting ZIP code-level COVID-19 risk for 2021."
Efficient coupling of within- and between-host infectious disease dynamics,2023-12-18 00:00:00,"Cameron A. Smith, Ben Ashby",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11592,"Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission typically neglect within-host dynamics. Yet within-host dynamics - including pathogen replication, host immune responses, and interactions with microbiota - are crucial not only for determining the progression of disease at the individual level, but also for driving within-host evolution and onwards transmission, and therefore shape dynamics at the population level. Various approaches have been proposed to model both within- and between-host dynamics, but these typically require considerable simplifying assumptions to couple processes at contrasting scales (e.g., the within-host dynamics quickly reach a steady state) or are computationally intensive. Here we propose a novel, readily adaptable and broadly applicable method for modelling both within- and between-host processes which can fully couple dynamics across scales and is both realistic and computationally efficient. By individually tracking the deterministic within-host dynamics of infected individuals, and stochastically coupling these to continuous host state variables at the population-level, we take advantage of fast numerical methods at both scales while still capturing individual transient within-host dynamics and stochasticity in transmission between hosts. Our approach closely agrees with full stochastic individual-based simulations and is especially useful when the within-host dynamics do not rapidly reach a steady state or over longer timescales to track pathogen evolution. By applying our method to different pathogen growth scenarios we show how common simplifying assumptions fundamentally change epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics."
Feasible contact tracing,2023-12-09 00:00:00,"Aparajithan Venkateswaran, Jishnu Das, Tyler H. McCormick",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05718,"Contact tracing is one of the most important tools for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, but as the experience of COVID-19 showed, it is also next-to-impossible to implement when the disease is spreading rapidly. We show how to substantially improve the efficiency of contact tracing by combining standard microeconomic tools that measure heterogeneity in how infectious a sick person is with ideas from machine learning about sequential optimization. Our contributions are twofold. First, we incorporate heterogeneity in individual infectiousness in a multi-armed bandit to establish optimal algorithms. At the heart of this strategy is a focus on learning. In the typical conceptualization of contact tracing, contacts of an infected person are tested to find more infections. Under a learning-first framework, however, contacts of infected persons are tested to ascertain whether the infected person is likely to be a ""high infector"" and to find additional infections only if it is likely to be highly fruitful. Second, we demonstrate using three administrative contact tracing datasets from India and Pakistan during COVID-19 that this strategy improves efficiency. Using our algorithm, we find 80% of infections with just 40% of contacts while current approaches test twice as many contacts to identify the same number of infections. We further show that a simple strategy that can be easily implemented in the field performs at nearly optimal levels, allowing for, what we call, feasible contact tracing. These results are immediately transferable to contact tracing in any epidemic."
On the calibration of compartmental epidemiological models,2023-12-08 00:00:00,"Nikunj Gupta, Anh Mai, Azza Abouzied, Dennis Shasha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05456,"Epidemiological compartmental models are useful for understanding infectious disease propagation and directing public health policy decisions. Calibration of these models is an important step in offering accurate forecasts of disease dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions. In this study, we present an overview of calibrating strategies that can be employed, including several optimization methods and reinforcement learning (RL). We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these methods and highlight relevant practical conclusions from our experiments. Optimization methods iteratively adjust the parameters of the model until the model output matches the available data, whereas RL uses trial and error to learn the optimal set of parameters by maximizing a reward signal. Finally, we discuss how the calibration of parameters of epidemiological compartmental models is an emerging field that has the potential to improve the accuracy of disease modeling and public health decision-making. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness and scalability of these approaches in different epidemiological contexts.

Focusing on infectious disease, we review how Digital Epidemiology (DE) was at the beginning of 2020 and how it was changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, in both nature and breadth. We argue that DE will become a progressively useful tool as long as its potential is recognized and its risks are minimized. Therefore, we expand on the current views and present a new definition of DE that, by highlighting the statistical nature of the datasets, helps in identifying possible biases. We offer some recommendations to reduce inequity and threats to privacy and argue in favour of complex multidisciplinary approaches to tackling infectious diseases."
Information Design for Hybrid Work under Infectious Disease Transmission Risk,2023-12-07 00:00:00,"Sohil Shah, Saurabh Amin, Patrick Jaillet",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04073,"We study a planner's provision of information to manage workplace occupancy when strategic workers (agents) face risk of infectious disease transmission. The planner implements an information mechanism to signal information about the underlying risk of infection at the workplace. Agents update their belief over the risk parameter using this information and choose to work in-person or remotely. We address the design of the optimal signaling mechanism that best aligns the workplace occupancy with the planner's preference (i.e., maintaining safe capacity limits and operational efficiency at workplace). For various forms of planner preferences, we show numerical and analytical proof that interval-based information mechanisms are optimal. These mechanisms partition the continuous domain of the risk parameter into disjoint intervals and provision information based on interval-specific probability distributions over a finite set of signals. When the planner seeks to achieve an occupancy that lies in one of finitely many pre-specified ranges independent of the underlying risk, we provide an optimal mechanism that uses at most two intervals. On the other hand, when the preference on the occupancy is risk-dependent, we show that an approximately optimal interval-based mechanism can be computed efficiently. We bound the approximation loss for preferences that are expressed through a Lipschitz continuous function of both occupancy and risk parameter. We provide examples that demonstrate the improvement of proposed signaling mechanisms relative to the common benchmarks in information provision. Our findings suggest that information provision over the risk of disease transmission is an effective intervention for maintaining desirable occupancy levels at the workplace."
Masking Behaviors in Epidemiological Networks with Cognitively-plausible Reinforcement Learning,2023-12-06 00:00:00,"Konstantinos Mitsopoulos, Lawrence Baker, Christian Lebiere, Peter Pirolli, Mark Orr, Raffaele Vardavas",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03301,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of human behavior in influencing infectious disease transmission and the need for models capturing this complex dynamic. We present an agent-based model integrating an epidemiological simulation of disease spread with a cognitive architecture driving individual mask-wearing decisions. Agents decide whether to mask based on a utility function weighting factors like peer conformity, personal risk tolerance, and mask-wearing discomfort. By conducting experiments systematically varying behavioral model parameters and social network structures, we demonstrate how adaptive decision-making interacts with network connectivity patterns to impact population-level infection outcomes. The model provides a flexible computational framework for gaining insights into how behavioral interventions like mask mandates may differentially influence disease spread across communities with diverse social structures. Findings highlight the importance of integrating realistic human decision processes in epidemiological models to inform policy decisions during public health crises."
SimPLoID: Harnessing probabilistic logic programming for infectious disease epidemiology,2023-12-01 00:00:00,"Felix Weitkämper, Ameen Almiftah, Kailin Sun",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00934,"High quality epidemiological modelling is essential in order to combat the spread of infectious diseases. In this contribution, we present SimPLoID, an epidemiological modelling framework based on the probabilistic logic programming language ProbLog. SimPLoiI combines concepts from compartmental modelling, such as the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, with network-based modelling. As a proof of concept, SimPLoID showcases the potential of declarative probabilistic logic programming for a natural, flexible and compact expression of infectious disease dynamics. In particular, its modularity makes it easily extendable in the face of changing requirements. This application area benefits especially from the precisely specified semantics of the ProbLog language and from the well-maintained engines, which support a variety of query types from exact inference to Monte Carlo simulation. We also provide a domain-specific language designed for researchers not trained in programming, which is compiled to ProbLog clauses within an interactive Python application."

We employ spatial statistical methods on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in identifying wards that could be targeted for strengthening health security in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. In this way, the identified high-risk wards would be more effective and prepared to respond to future pandemics and emergencies."
Impact of Indoor Mobility Behavior on the Respiratory Infectious Diseases Transmission Trends,2023-11-28 00:00:00,"Ziwei Cui, Ming Cai, Zheng Zhu, Gongbo Chen, Yao Xiao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17318,"The importance of indoor human mobility in the transmission dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases has been acknowledged. Previous studies have predominantly addressed a single type of mobility behavior such as queueing and a series of behaviors under specific scenarios. However, these studies ignore the abstraction of mobility behavior in various scenes and the critical examination of how these abstracted behaviors impact disease propagation. To address these problems, this study considers people's mobility behaviors in a general scenario, abstracting them into two main categories: crowding behavior, related to the spatial aspect, and stopping behavior, related to the temporal aspect. Accordingly, this study investigates their impacts on disease spreading and the impact of individual spatio-temporal distribution resulting from these mobility behaviors on epidemic transmission. First, a point of interest (POI) method is introduced to quantify the crowding-related spatial POI factors (i.e., the number of crowdings and the distance between crowdings) and stopping-related temporal POI factors (i.e., the number of stoppings and the duration of each stopping). Besides, a personal space determined with Voronoi diagrams is used to construct the individual spatio-temporal distribution factor. Second, two indicators (i.e., the daily number of new cases and the average exposure risk of people) are applied to quantify epidemic transmission. These indicators are derived from a fundamental model which accurately predicts disease transmission between moving individuals. Third, a set of 200 indoor scenarios is constructed and simulated to help determine variable values. Concurrently, the influences and underlying mechanisms of these behavioral factors on disease transmission are examined using structural equation modeling and causal inference modeling......"
Optimal Social and Vaccination Control in the SVIR Epidemic Model,2023-11-27 00:00:00,Alessandro Ramponiand M.

We consider a cost functional encompassing three distinct yet interconnected dimensions: the social cost, the disease cost, and the vaccination cost. The proposed model addresses the pressing need for optimized strategies in disease containment, incorporating both social control measures and vaccination campaigns. Through the utilization of advanced control theory, we identify optimal control strategies that mitigate disease proliferation while considering the inherent trade-offs among social interventions and vaccination efforts. Finally, numerical implementation of the optimally controlled system through the Forward-Backward Sweep algorithm is presented."
Semi-metric topology characterizes epidemic spreading on complex networks,2023-11-24 00:00:00,"David Soriano Paños, Felipe Xavier Costa, Luis M. Rocha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14817,"Network sparsification represents an essential tool to extract the core of interactions sustaining both networks dynamics and their connectedness. In the case of infectious diseases, network sparsification methods remove irrelevant connections to unveil the primary subgraph driving the unfolding of epidemic outbreaks in real networks. In this paper, we explore the features determining whether the metric backbone, a subgraph capturing the structure of shortest paths across a network, allows reconstructing epidemic outbreaks. We find that both the relative size of the metric backbone, capturing the fraction of edges kept in such structure, and the distortion of semi-metric edges, quantifying how far those edges not included in the metric backbone are from their associated shortest path, shape the retrieval of Susceptible-Infected (SI) dynamics. We propose a new method to progressively dismantle networks relying on the semi-metric edge distortion, removing first those connections farther from those included in the metric backbone, i.e. those with highest semi-metric distortion values. We apply our method in both synthetic and real networks, finding that semi-metric distortion provides solid ground to preserve spreading dynamics and connectedness while sparsifying networks."

Dynamics of a two-strain epidemic model with waning immunity -- a perturbative approach,2023-11-19 00:00:00,"Nir Gavish, Musa Rabiu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11318,"Many infectious diseases are comprised of multiple strains with examples including Influenza, tuberculosis, and Dengue virus. The time evolution of such systems is linked to a complex landscape shaped by interactions between competing strains. Possible long-term dynamics include the extinction of less competitive strains, convergence to multi-strain steady-states, or self-sustained oscillations. This work considers a two-strain epidemic model in which the strains can interact indirectly via the immunity response generated following infections, and in which this immune response wanes with time. In particular, we focus on scenarios where the rate of waning immunity is significantly faster than the rate of demographic turnover. The first key result of this study is the explicit computation of the steady states of the nonlinear system of seven equations. Following this result, we take advantage of the separation of time scales in the problem and use perturbation methods to analyze the stability of the fixed points. In particular, we establish the conditions under which the system gives rise to the coexistence of the two strains and whether coexistence is attained via convergence to an endemic steady-state or via self-sustained oscillations. Our study unveils two parameter regimes of distinct qualitative behavior of the system and characterizes the separatrix between them. Within the first regime, the system gives rise to oscillatory coexistence for all feasible conditions. In the second regime, the system's behavior is governed by a solution to a quadratic equation, potentially resulting in the convergence to a multi-strain endemic equilibrium or the persistence of oscillatory coexistence."

Symptoms include headaches, chills, fever, smallpox, measles, and chickenpox-like skin manifestations and the WHO officially announced MPox as a global public health pandemic, in July 2022.Traditionally, PCR testing of skin lesions is considered a benchmark for the primary diagnosis by WHO, with symptom management as the primary treatment and antiviral drugs like tecovirimat for severe cases. However, manual analysis within hospitals poses a substantial challenge including the substantial burden on healthcare professionals, limited facilities, availability and fatigue among doctors, and human error during public health emergencies. Therefore, this survey paper provides an extensive and efficient analysis of deep learning (DL) methods for the automatic detection of MPox in skin lesion images. These DL techniques are broadly grouped into categories, including deep CNN, Deep CNNs ensemble, deep hybrid learning, the newly developed, and Vision transformer for diagnosing MPox.

On simulation-based inference for implicitly defined models,2023-11-15 00:00:00,Joonha Park,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09446,"In many applications, a stochastic system is studied using a model implicitly defined via a simulator. We develop a simulation-based parameter inference method for implicitly defined models. Our method differs from traditional likelihood-based inference in that it uses a metamodel for the distribution of a log-likelihood estimator. The metamodel is built on a local asymptotic normality (LAN) property satisfied by the simulation-based log-likelihood estimator under certain conditions. A method for hypothesis test is developed under the metamodel. Our method can enable accurate parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification where other Monte Carlo methods for parameter inference become highly inefficient due to large Monte Carlo variance.

The person-to-person contacts and interactions contribute to the complexity of infectious disease, which is inherently different from non-communicable diseases. Besides, the complex relationships between street view imagery and epidemic exposure also hinder accurate predictions. To address these problems, we construct a regional mobility graph informed by the gravity model, based on which we propose a transmission-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture disease transmission patterns arising from human mobility. Experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline models by 8.54% in weighted F1, shedding light on a low-cost, scalable approach to assess epidemic exposure risks from street view imagery."

Materials and Methods: We represented 586 datasets, 54 software, and 24 data formats in OWL 2 and then used logical queries to infer potentially interoperable combinations of software and datasets, as well as statistics about the FAIRness of the collection. We represented the objects in DATS 2.2 and a software metadata schema of our own design. We used these representations as the basis for the Content, Search, FAIR-o-meter, and Workflow pages that constitute the MIDAS Digital Commons. Results: Interoperability was limited by lack of standardization of input and output formats of software. When formats existed, they were human-readable specifications (22/24; 92%); only 3 formats (13%) had machine-readable specifications. Nevertheless, logical search of a triple store based on named data formats was able to identify scores of potentially interoperable combinations of software and datasets. Discussion: We improved the findability and availability of a sample of software and datasets and developed metrics for assessing interoperability. The barriers to interoperability included poor documentation of software input/output formats and little attention to standardization of most types of data in this field. Conclusion: Centralizing and formalizing the representation of digital objects within a commons promotes FAIRness, enables its measurement over time and the identification of potentially interoperable combinations of data and software."
On the dynamics of an epidemic patch model with mass-action transmission mechanism and asymmetric dispersal patterns,2023-11-10 00:00:00,"Rachidi Salako, Yixiang Wu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06437,"This paper examines an epidemic patch model with mass-action transmission mechanism and asymmetric connectivity matrix. Results on the global dynamics of solutions and the spatial structures of endemic solutions are obtained. In particular, we show that when the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ is less than one and the dispersal rate of the susceptible population $d_S$ is large, the population would eventually stabilize at the disease-free equilibrium. However, the disease may persist if $d_S$ is small, even if $\mathcal{R}_0<1$. In such a scenario, explicit conditions on the model parameters that lead to the existence of multiple endemic equilibria are identified. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of infectious diseases in multi-patch environments. Moreover, results in [27], which is for the same model but with symmetric connectivity matrix, are generalized and improved."
On Optimal Control at the Onset of a New Viral Outbreak,2023-11-09 00:00:00,"Alexandra Smirnova, Xiaojing Ye",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05738,"An optimal control problem for the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak is considered. At that stage, control is often limited to non-medical interventions like social distancing and other behavioral changes. We show that the running cost of control satisfying mild, problem-specific, conditions generates an optimal control strategy that stays inside its admissible set for the entire duration of the study period $[0 ,T]$. For the optimal control problem, restricted by SIR compartmental model of disease transmission, we prove that the optimal control strategy, $u(t)$, may be growing until some moment $\bar{t} \in [0 ,T)$. However, for any $t \in [\bar{t}, T]$, the function $u(t)$ will decline as $t$ approaches $T$, which may cause the number of newly infected people to increase. So, the window from $0$ to $\bar{t}$ is the time for public health officials to prepare alternative mitigation measures, such as vaccines, testing, antiviral medications, and others. Our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical examples showing optimal control strategies for various cost functions and weights. Simulation results provide a comprehensive demonstration of the effects of control on the epidemic spread and mitigation expenses, which can serve as invaluable references for public health officials."

While these approaches have played a central role in studying the mechanics underlying epidemics, we lack ways to reliably predict how the relationship between virulence (the harm to hosts caused by an infection) and transmission will evolve in certain virus-host contexts. In this study, we invoke evolutionary invasion analysis -- a method used to identify the evolution of uninvadable strategies in dynamical systems -- to examine how the virulence-transmission dichotomy can evolve in models of virus infections defined by different natural histories. We reveal that peculiar ecologies drive different evolved relationships between virulence and transmission. Specifically, we discover patterns of virulence evolution between epidemics of various kinds (SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis C virus) and that varying definitions of virulence alter our predictions for how viruses will evolve. We discuss the findings in light of contemporary conversations in the public health sector around the possibility of predicting virus evolution and in more extensive theoretical discussions involving virulence evolution in emerging infectious diseases."
Prediction of viral spillover risk based on the mass action principle,2023-11-06 00:00:00,"Maryam Golchin, Moreno Di Marco, Paul Horwood, Dean Paini, Andrew Hoskins, R. I.

More than 70% of the 400 infectious diseases that emerged in the past five decades have a zoonotic origin, including all recent pandemics. There have been several approaches used to predict the risk of spillover through some of the known or suspected infectious disease emergence drivers, largely using correlative approaches. Here, we predict the spatial distribution of spillover risk by approximating general transmission through animal and human interactions. These mass action interactions are approximated through the multiplication of the spatial distribution of zoonotic viral diversity and human population density. Although our results indicate higher risk in regions along the equator and in Southeast Asia where both viral diversity and human population density are high, it should be noted that this is primarily a conceptual exercise. We compared our spillover risk map to key factors, including the model inputs of zoonotic viral diversity estimate map, human population density map, and the spatial distribution of species richness. Despite the limitations of this approach, this viral spillover map is a step towards developing a more comprehensive spillover risk prediction system to inform global monitoring."
The Case for Controls: Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-control comparisons,2023-11-03 00:00:00,"Nina H. Fefferman, Michael J. Blum, Lydia Bourouiba, Nathaniel L. Gibson, Qiang He, Debra L. Miller, Monica Papes, Dana K. Pasquale, Connor Verheyen, Sadie J. Ryan",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02226,"Investigations of infectious disease outbreaks often focus on identifying place- and context-dependent factors responsible for emergence and spread, resulting in phenomenological narratives ill-suited to developing generalizable predictive and preventive measures. We contend that case-control hypothesis testing is a more powerful framework for epidemiological investigation. The approach, widely used in medical research, involves identifying counterfactuals, with case-control comparisons drawn to test hypotheses about the conditions that manifest outbreaks. Here we outline the merits of applying a case-control framework as epidemiological study design. We first describe a framework for iterative multidisciplinary interrogation to discover minimally sufficient sets of factors that can lead to disease outbreaks. We then lay out how case-control comparisons can respectively center on pathogen(s), factor(s), or landscape(s) with vignettes focusing on pathogen transmission. Finally, we consider how adopting case-control approaches can promote evidence-based decision making for responding to and preventing outbreaks."
Path Integral Control in Infectious Disease Modeling,2023-11-02 00:00:00,Paramahansa Pramanik,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02113,"COVID-19, a global pandemic of unprecedented scale, has had a profound impact on nations worldwide, resulting in the tragic loss of nearly 1.1 million lives in the United States and a staggering 7 million worldwide. In the absence of effective vaccines, governments across the globe resorted to the implementation of lockdown measures as a vital strategy to mitigate the virus's relentless spread. While these restrictions were widely enforced, crucial sectors like public health and safety remained operational, ensuring the continuity of essential services. The timing and stringency of lockdown measures in various U.S. states were intricately tailored to the severity of the outbreak within their respective regions. Lockdowns effectively curtailed social interactions, thereby significantly reducing virus transmission. However, it is essential to strike a balance, as prolonged lockdowns can sow apprehension among the populace, impeding the resumption of normal social activities due to the persistent fear of contracting COVID-19. These prolonged restrictions have reverberated throughout the business landscape, resulting in reduced consumer and employee participation, ultimately denting long-term profitability sustainability. Businesses that lacked the resilience of adequate inventory faced the dire prospect of permanent closure. Regrettably, the absence of substantial government financial support has made business closure an all too common outcome, with the arduous task of revival to former employment levels."

Metagenomic analysis is crucial, for instance, in clinical applications such as infectious disease screening and the diagnosis and early detection of diseases such as cancer. A key task in metagenomics is to determine the species present in a sample and their relative abundances. Currently, the field is dominated by either alignment-based tools, which offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive, or alignment-free tools, which are fast but lack the needed accuracy for many applications. In response to this dichotomy, we introduce MetaFast, a tool based on heuristics, to achieve a fundamental improvement in accuracy-runtime tradeoff over existing methods. MetaFast delivers accuracy comparable to the alignment-based and highly accurate tool Metalign but with significantly enhanced efficiency. In MetaFast, we accelerate memory-frugal reference database indexing and filtering. We further employ heuristics to accelerate read mapping. Our evaluation demonstrates that MetaFast achieves a 4x speedup over Metalign without compromising accuracy. MetaFast is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/MetaFast."

Kinetic compartmental models driven by opinion dynamics: Vaccine hesitancy and social influence,2023-10-30 00:00:00,"Andrea Bondesan, Giuseppe Toscani, Mattia Zanella",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19601,"We propose a kinetic model for understanding the link between opinion formation phenomena and epidemic dynamics. The recent pandemic has brought to light that vaccine hesitancy can present different phases and temporal and spatial variations, presumably due to the different social features of individuals. The emergence of patterns in societal reactions permits to design and predict the trends of a pandemic. This suggests that the problem of vaccine hesitancy can be described in mathematical terms, by suitably coupling a kinetic compartmental model for the spreading of an infectious disease with the evolution of the personal opinion of individuals, in the presence of leaders. The resulting model makes it possible to predict the collective compliance with vaccination campaigns as the pandemic evolves and to highlight the best strategy to set up for maximizing the vaccination coverage. We conduct numerical investigations which confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena related to the spread of an epidemic."
Early Detection of Tuberculosis with Machine Learning Cough Audio Analysis: Towards More Accessible Global Triaging Usage,2023-10-25 00:00:00,Chandra Suda,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17675,"Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial disease mainly affecting the lungs, is one of the leading infectious causes of mortality worldwide. To prevent TB from spreading within the body, which causes life-threatening complications, timely and effective anti-TB treatment is crucial. Cough, an objective biomarker for TB, is a triage tool that monitors treatment response and regresses with successful therapy. Current gold standards for TB diagnosis are slow or inaccessible, especially in rural areas where TB is most prevalent. In addition, current machine learning (ML) diagnosis research, like utilizing chest radiographs, is ineffective and does not monitor treatment progression. To enable effective diagnosis, an ensemble model was developed that analyzes, using a novel ML architecture, coughs' acoustic epidemiologies from smartphones' microphones to detect TB. The architecture includes a 2D-CNN and XGBoost that was trained on 724,964 cough audio samples and demographics from 7 countries. After feature extraction (Mel-spectrograms) and data augmentation (IR-convolution), the model achieved AUROC (area under the receiving operator characteristic) of 88%, surpassing WHO's requirements for screening tests. The results are available within 15 seconds and can easily be accessible via a mobile app. This research helps to improve TB diagnosis through a promising accurate, quick, and accessible triaging tool."
Learning COVID-19 Regional Transmission Using Universal Differential Equations in a SIR model,2023-11-03 00:00:00,"Adrian Rojas-Campos, Lukas Stelz, Pascal Nieters",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16804,"Highly-interconnected societies difficult to model the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Single-region SIR models fail to account for incoming forces of infection and expanding them to a large number of interacting regions involves many assumptions that do not hold in the real world. We propose using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to capture the influence of neighboring regions and improve the model's predictions in a combined SIR+UDE model. UDEs are differential equations totally or partially defined by a deep neural network (DNN). We include an additive term to the SIR equations composed by a DNN that learns the incoming force of infection from the other regions. The learning is performed using automatic differentiation and gradient descent to approach the change in the target system caused by the state of the neighboring regions. We compared the proposed model using a simulated COVID-19 outbreak against a single-region SIR and a fully data-driven model composed only of a DNN. The proposed UDE+SIR model generates predictions that capture the outbreak dynamic more accurately, but a decay in performance is observed at the last stages of the outbreak. The single-area SIR and the fully data-driven approach do not capture the proper dynamics accurately. Once the predictions were obtained, we employed the SINDy algorithm to substitute the DNN with a regression, removing the black box element of the model with no considerable increase in the error levels."
A Bayesian model calibration framework for stochastic compartmental models with both time-varying and time-invariant parameters,2023-11-04 00:00:00,"Brandon Robinson, Philippe Bisaillon, Jodi D. Edwards, Tetyana Kendzerska, Mohammad Khalil, Dominique Poirel, Abhijit Sarkar",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16169,"We consider state and parameter estimation for compartmental models having both time-varying and time-invariant parameters. Though the described Bayesian computational framework is general, we look at a specific application to the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model which describes a basic mechanism for the spread of infectious diseases through a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The SIR model consists of three states, namely, the three compartments, and two parameters which control the coupling among the states. The deterministic SIR model with time-invariant parameters has shown to be overly simplistic for modelling the complex long-term dynamics of diseases transmission. Recognizing that certain model parameters will naturally vary in time due to seasonal trends, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and other random effects, the estimation procedure must systematically permit these time-varying effects to be captured, without unduly introducing artificial dynamics into the system. To this end, we leverage the robustness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of time-invariant parameters alongside nonlinear filters for the joint estimation of the system state and time-varying parameters. We demonstrate performance of the framework by first considering a series of examples using synthetic data, followed by an exposition on public health data collected in the province of Ontario."

Samet, Alexander F. Siegenfeld, Nassim N. Taleb",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15198,"The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency to understand and prevent pathogen transmission, specifically regarding infectious airborne particles. Extensive studies validate the understanding of larger (droplets) and smaller (aerosols) particles in disease transmission. Similarly, N95 respirators, and other forms of respiratory protection, have proven efficacy in reducing the risk of infection across various environments. Even though multiple studies confirm their protective effect when adopted in healthcare and public settings for infection prevention, studies on their adoption over the last several decades in both clinical trials and observational studies have not provided as clear an understanding. Here we show that the standard analytical equations used in the analysis of these studies do not accurately represent the random variables impacting study results. By correcting these equations, it is demonstrated that conclusions drawn from these studies are heavily biased and uncertain, providing little useful information. Despite these limitations, we show that when outcome measures are properly analyzed, existing results consistently point to the benefit of N95 respirators over medical masks, and masking over its absence. Correcting errors in widely reported meta-analyses also yields statistically significant estimates. These findings have important implications for study design and using existing evidence for infection control policy guidelines."

Differential privacy provides a formal guarantee that individual-level information about users does not leak. In this framework, randomized algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data, resulting in privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to make valid inferences on the parameters underlying the confidential data. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. In addition to sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation, we use neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and with ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms."
Infection Curve Flattening via Targeted Interventions and Self-Isolation,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Houman Zarrabi, Azam Doustmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12594,"Understanding the impact of network clustering and small-world properties on epidemic spread can be crucial in developing effective strategies for managing and controlling infectious diseases. Particularly in this work, we study the impact of these network features on targeted intervention (e.g., self-isolation and quarantine). The targeted individuals for self-isolation are based on centrality measures and node influence metrics. Compared to our previous works on scale-free networks, small-world networks are considered in this paper. Small-world networks resemble real-world social and human networks. In this type of network, most nodes are not directly connected but can be reached through a few intermediaries (known as the small-worldness property). Real social networks, such as friendship networks, also exhibit this small-worldness property, where most people are connected through a relatively small number of intermediaries. We particularly study the epidemic curve flattening by centrality-based interventions/isolation over small-world networks. Our results show that high clustering while having low small-worldness (higher shortest path characteristics) implies flatter infection curves. In reality, a flatter infection curve implies that the number of new cases of a disease is spread out over a longer period of time, rather than a sharp and sudden increase in cases (a peak in epidemic). In turn, this reduces the strain on healthcare resources and helps to relieve the healthcare services."

Vaccination factor revealed a potent weapon against outbreaks higher vaccination percentage not only delayed infection peaks but also substantially curtailed their impact.

Firstly, Multi-Head Attentional Self-Convolution not only improves the convergence speed of the model but also enhances the accuracy of the model detection. Secondly, the introduction of Swin Transformer Block is able to extract more useful feature information, enhance the detection ability of small targets, and improve the overall accuracy of the model.

Network-thinking to optimize surveillance and control of crop parasites.

Optimizing crop protection is urgently needed to ensure food safety. One aspect of crop protection is surveillance, which focuses on the early detection of a parasite, and control, aiming to fight and possibly eradicate it. Network theory has been widely used to model the spread of human and animal infectious diseases in systems described through nodes and edges. It has been successfully used to optimize monitoring and immunization campaigns. In crop protection, there is a growing literature using this theory to describe parasites spread and to conceive protection strategies. Here we review the use of network theory in crop protection, from the more descriptive to the more applied approaches aimed to optimize crop protection. We retrace the logical process that has led epidemiological models to rely on network theory, and we provide examples of how the spread of crop parasites has been represented via a network description. We define the objectives of surveillance and control, and we show how these have been declined in the network-based epidemiological sphere and then adapted in the agricultural context. We eventually discuss the discrepancy between the application of network theory in surveillance and control to identify culprits and solutions. We find that: i) scientists have successfully interpreted very different modes of parasitic transmission under the lens of network theory; ii) while network-based surveillance has progressively clarified its objectives and sound tools have been proposed, network-based control has been less studied and applied; iii) network-thinking must address how to properly define edges and nodes at different geographic scale to broad its application in crop protection."

Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics such that any new infection increased mortality in all three diseases, indicating possibly general immunosuppressive effects at population level."

Graphical abstracts are small graphs of concepts that visually summarize the main findings of scientific articles. While graphical abstracts are customarily used in scientific publications to anticipate and summarize their main results, we propose them as a means for expressing graph searches over existing literature. Materials and methods. We consider the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a corpus of more than one million abstracts; each of them is described as a graph of co-occurring ontological terms, selected from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease (CIDO). Graphical abstracts are also expressed as graphs of ontological terms, possibly augmented by utility terms describing their interactions (e.g., ""associated with"", ""increases"", ""induces""). We build a co-occurrence network of concepts mentioned in the corpus; we then identify the best matches of graphical abstracts on the network. We exploit graph database technology and shortest-path queries. Results. We build a large co-occurrence network, consisting of 128,249 entities and 47,198,965 relationships.

Initiatives Based on the Psychology of Scarcity Can Increase Covid-19 Vaccinations,2023-10-05 00:00:00,"Alessandro Del Ponte, Audrey De Dominicis, Paolo Canofari",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03689,"Background: Here we investigate whether releasing COVID-19 vaccines in limited quantities and at limited times boosted Italy's vaccination campaign in 2021. This strategy exploits insights from psychology and consumer marketing. Methods: We built an original dataset covering 200 days of vaccination data in Italy, including 'open day' events. Open-day events (in short: open days) are instances where COVID-19 vaccines were released in limited quantities and only for a specific day at a specified location (usually, a large pavilion or a public building). Our dependent variables are the number of total and first doses administered in proportion to the eligible population. Our key independent variable is the presence of open-day events in a given region on a specific day. We analyzed the data using regression with fixed effects for time and region. The analysis was robust to alternative model specifications. Findings: We find that when an open day event was organized, in proportion to the eligible population, there was an average 0.39-0.44 percentage point increase in total doses administered and a 0.30-0.33 percentage point increase in first doses administered. These figures correspond to an average increase of 10,455-11,796 in total doses administered and 8,043-8,847 in the first doses administered. Interpretation: Releasing vaccines in limited quantities and at limited times by organizing open-day events was associated with an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations in most Italian regions. These results call for wider adoption of vaccination strategies based on the limited release of vaccines for other infectious diseases or future pandemics."
Paradoxes in the co-evolution of contagions and institutions,2023-10-09 00:00:00,"Jonathan St-Onge, Giulio Burgio, Samuel F. Rosenblatt, Timothy M. Waring, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03672,"Epidemic models study the spread of an undesired agent through a population, be it infectious diseases through a country, misinformation in online social media, or pests infesting a region. In combating these epidemics, we rely neither on global top-down interventions, nor solely on individual adaptations. Instead, interventions most commonly come from local institutions such as public health departments, moderation teams on social media platforms, or other forms of group governance. Classic models, which are often individual or agent-based, are ill-suited to capture local adaptations. We leverage recent development of institutional dynamics based on cultural group selection to study how groups can attempt local control of an epidemic by taking inspiration from the successes and failures of other groups. Incorporating these institutional changes into the epidemic dynamics reveals paradoxes: a higher transmission rate can result in smaller outbreaks and decreasing the speed of institutional adaptation generally reduces outbreak size. When groups perceive a contagion as more worrisome, they can invest in improved policies and, if they maintain these policies long enough to have impact, lead to a reduction in endemicity. By looking at the interplay between the speed of institutions and the transmission rate of the contagions, we find rich co-evolutionary dynamics that reflect the complexity of known biological and social contagions."

Here, some parameters may affect the sensitivities of others, requiring the analysis of higher order coefficients through e.g. Sobol sensitivity analysis. The geographical structures of real-world regions are distinct in that they are difficult to reduce to single parameter values, making a unified sensitivity analysis intractable. Yet analyzing the importance of geographical structure on the sensitivity of other input parameters is important because a strong effect would justify the use of models with real-world geographical representations, as opposed to stylized ones."
Population dynamics model for aging,2023-09-29 00:00:00,"Jacques Demongeot, Pierre Magal",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17106,"The chronological age used in demography describes the linear evolution of the life of a living being. The chronological age cannot give precise information about the exact developmental stage or aging processes an organism has reached. On the contrary, the biological age (or epigenetic age) represents the true evolution of the tissues and organs of the living being. Biological age is not always linear and sometimes proceeds by discontinuous jumps. These jumps can be positive (we then speak of rejuvenation) or negative (in the event of premature aging), and they can be dependent on endogenous events such as pregnancy (negative jump) or stroke (positive jump) or exogenous ones such as surgical treatment (negative jump) or infectious disease (positive jump). The article proposes a mathematical model of the biological age by defining a valid model for the two types of jumps (positive and negative). The existence and uniqueness of the solution are solved, and its temporal dynamic is analyzed using a moments equation. We also provide some individual-based stochastic simulations."
Novel Discrete Composite Distributions with Applications to Infectious Disease Data,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Bowen Liu, Malwane M. A. Ananda",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16443,"It was observed that the number of cases and deaths for infectious diseases were associated with heavy-tailed power law distributions such as the Pareto distribution. While Pareto distribution was widely used to model the cases and deaths of infectious diseases, a major limitation of Pareto distribution is that it can only fit a given data set beyond a certain threshold. Thus, it can only model part of the data set. Thus, we proposed some novel discrete composite distributions with Pareto tails to fit the real infectious disease data. To provide necessary statistical inference for the tail behavior of the data, we developed a hypothesis testing procedure to test the tail index parameter. COVID-19 reported cases in Singapore and monkeypox reported cases in France were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the newly created distributions. The results from the analysis suggested that the discrete composite distributions could demonstrate competitive performance compared to the commonly used discrete distributions. Furthermore, the analysis of the tail index parameter can provide great insights into preventing and controlling infectious diseases."
AE-GPT: Using Large Language Models to Extract Adverse Events from Surveillance Reports-A Use Case with Influenza Vaccine Adverse Events,2023-09-27 00:00:00,"Yiming Li, Jianfu Li, Jianping He, Cui Tao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16150,"Though Vaccines are instrumental in global health, mitigating infectious diseases and pandemic outbreaks, they can occasionally lead to adverse events (AEs). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in effectively identifying and cataloging AEs within clinical reports. Utilizing data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 1990 to 2016, this study particularly focuses on AEs to evaluate LLMs' capability for AE extraction. A variety of prevalent LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3 variants, GPT-4, and Llama 2, were evaluated using Influenza vaccine as a use case. The fine-tuned GPT 3.5 model (AE-GPT) stood out with a 0.704 averaged micro F1 score for strict match and 0.816 for relaxed match. The encouraging performance of the AE-GPT underscores LLMs' potential in processing medical data, indicating a significant stride towards advanced AE detection, thus presumably generalizable to other AE extraction tasks."

The method was validated against COVID-19 surveillance data collected in Italy over an 18-month period. Compared to traditional methods, the nowcasted reproduction number reduced the estimation delay from 13 to 8 days, while maintaining a better accuracy. Moreover, it allowed anticipating the detection of periods of epidemic growth by between 6 and 23 days. The method offers a simple and generally applicable tool to improve situational awareness during an epidemic outbreak, allowing for informed public health response planning."
Leveraging Herpangina Data to Enhance Hospital-level Prediction of Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease Admissions Using UPTST,2023-10-06 00:00:00,"Guoqi Yu, Hailun Yao, Huan Zheng, Ximing Xu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14674,"Outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease(HFMD) have been associated with significant morbidity and, in severe cases, mortality. Accurate forecasting of daily admissions of pediatric HFMD patients is therefore crucial for aiding the hospital in preparing for potential outbreaks and mitigating nosocomial transmissions. To address this pressing need, we propose a novel transformer-based model with a U-net shape, utilizing the patching strategy and the joint prediction strategy that capitalizes on insights from herpangina, a disease closely correlated with HFMD. This model also integrates representation learning by introducing reconstruction loss as an auxiliary loss. The results show that our U-net Patching Time Series Transformer (UPTST) model outperforms existing approaches in both long- and short-arm prediction accuracy of HFMD at hospital-level. Furthermore, the exploratory extension experiments show that the model's capabilities extend beyond prediction of infectious disease, suggesting broader applicability in various domains."
Can the natural system of viruses reconcile the current taxonomy with an alternative classification useful to clinicians?,2023-09-23 00:00:00,Alexandr A. Ezhov,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13419,"In 2022, a group of basic and clinical virologists, bioinformaticians, and evolutionary and structural biologists met in Oxford, UK, to develop a consensus on methodologies used to classify viruses. They concluded that virus taxonomy, which is hierarchical and based on evolution, is only one of many possible ways to classify viruses. This taxonomy, while satisfying the four principles they set out, faces difficulties in coordinating with other classification systems useful to clinicians, infectious disease specialists, agronomists, etc. One example discussed is the grouping of different viral strains that cause different diseases into the species Enterovirus C. Here we show that the use of a previously proposed variant of a natural virus classification system based on the use of Neural Replicator Analysis can resolve this contradiction by establishing the fine structure of the Enterovirus C species, in which strains that cause different diseases are placed in several different cells of the binomial table of viruses. A key element in enabling this is the sophisticated preprocessing of the original viral genomes using neural replicators."
Characterizing the temporally stable structure of community evolution in intra-urban origin-destination networks,2023-09-22 00:00:00,"Xiao-Jian Chen, Yuhui Zhao, Chaogui Kang, Xiaoyue Xing, Quanhua Dong, Yu Liu",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12691,"Intra-urban origin-destination (OD) network communities evolve throughout the day, indicating changing groups of closely connected regions. Under this variation, groups of regions with high consistency of community affiliation characterize the temporally stable structure of the evolution process, aiding in comprehending urban dynamics. However, how to quantify this consistency and identify these groups are open questions. In this study, we introduce the consensus OD network to quantify the consistency of community affiliation among regions. Furthermore, the temporally stable community decomposition method is proposed to identify groups of regions with high internal and low external consistency (named ""stable groups""), where each group consists of temporally stable cores and attaching peripheries. Wuhan taxi data is used to verify our methods. On the hourly time scale, eleven stable groups containing 82.9% of regions are identified. This high percentage suggests that dynamic communities can be well organized via cores. Moreover, stable groups are spatially closed and more likely to distribute within a single district and separated by water bodies. Cores exhibit higher POI entropy and more healthcare and shopping services than peripheries. Our methods and empirical findings contribute to some practical issues, such as urban area division, polycentric evaluation and construction, and infectious disease control."
Analysis and Applications of Population Flows in a Networked SEIRS Epidemic Process,2023-09-20 00:00:00,"Brooks A. Butler, Raphael Stern, Philip E.

In this work, we define a networked susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered epidemic process with loss of immunity over time (SEIRS) that explicitly models the flow of individuals between sub-populations, which serves as the propagating mechanism for infection. We provide sufficient conditions for local stability and instability of the healthy state of the system and show that no perturbation of population flows can change the local stability of any healthy state. We also provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an endemic state. We then develop tools and methods for applying our model to real-world data, including spreading parameter estimation and disease arrival time prediction, and apply them in a case study using both travel and infection data from counties in Minnesota during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Infection patterns in simple and complex contagion processes on networks,2023-09-19 00:00:00,"Diego Andrés Contreras, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10486,"Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the structure and intensity of the interactions between individuals. While it is well known that the network structure has a fundamental impact on how a spreading process unfolds, the reverse question is less investigated: do different processes unfolding on a given network substrate lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of spreading models of both simple and complex contagion processes. Specifically, we measure for each link of the network the probability that it is used in a contagion event and compare how these probabilities depend on the model used to describe the spreading process. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust against modifications of parameters and across models. In complex contagion models, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, we observe instead non-trivial dependencies with models parameters. When group interactions are taken into account, the infection pattern changes according to the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, it is sufficient to slightly modify the threshold to significantly impact the paths followed by the spread. Our results improve our understanding of contagion processes on networks, in particular with respect to the ability to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and with respect to the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature."
Unraveling the Geography of Infection Spread: Harnessing Super-Agents for Predictive Modeling,2023-11-28 00:00:00,"Amir Mohammad Esmaieeli Sikaroudi, Alon Efrat, Michael Chertkov",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07055,"Our study presents an intermediate-level modeling approach that bridges the gap between complex Agent-Based Models (ABMs) and traditional compartmental models for infectious diseases.

Voronoi Diagram tessellations, based on specific street network locations, outperform standard Census Block Group tessellations, and a hybrid approach balances accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarking against existing ABMs highlights key optimizations.

A Comparison between Markov Switching Zero-inflated and Hurdle Models for Spatio-temporal Infectious Disease Counts,2023-09-08 00:00:00,"Mingchi Xu, Dirk Douwes-Schultz, Alexandra M. Schmidt",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04594,"In epidemiological studies, zero-inflated and hurdle models are commonly used to handle excess zeros in reported infectious disease cases. However, they can not model the persistence (from presence to presence) and reemergence (from absence to presence) of a disease separately. Covariates can sometimes have different effects on the reemergence and persistence of a disease. Recently, a zero-inflated Markov switching negative binomial model was proposed to accommodate this issue. We present a Markov switching negative binomial hurdle model as a competitor of that approach, as hurdle models are often also used as alternatives to zero-inflated models for accommodating excess zeroes. We begin the comparison by inspecting the underlying assumptions made by both models. Hurdle models assume perfect detection of the disease cases while zero-inflated models implicitly assume the case counts can be under-reported, thus we investigate when a negative binomial distribution can approximate the true distribution of reported counts. A comparison of the fit of the two types of Markov switching models is undertaken on chikungunya cases across the neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We find that, among the fitted models, the Markov switching negative binomial zero-inflated model produces the best predictions and both Markov switching models produce remarkably better predictions than more traditional negative binomial hurdle and zero-inflated models."
Disposable face masks: a direct source for inhalation of microplastics,2023-08-30 00:00:00,"Andres F. Prada, Avram Distler, Shyuan Cheng, John W. Scott, Leonardo P. Chamorro, Ganesh Subramanian, Vishal Verma, Andrew Turner",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16295,"Surgical masks have played a crucial role in healthcare facilities to protect against respiratory and infectious diseases, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the synthetic fibers, mainly made of polypropylene, used in their production may adversely affect the environment and human health. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of microplastics and fibers in human lungs and have related these synthetic particles with the occurrence of pulmonary ground glass nodules. Using a piston system to simulate human breathing, this study investigates the role of surgical masks as a direct source of inhalation of microplastics. Results reveal the release of particles of sizes ranging from nanometers (300 nm) to millimeters (~2 mm) during normal breathing conditions, raising concerns about the potential health risks. Notably, large visible particles (> 1 mm) were observed to be ejected from masks with limited wear after only a few breathing cycles. Given the widespread use of masks by healthcare workers and the potential future need for mask usage by the general population during seasonal infectious diseases or new pandemics, developing face masks using safe materials for both users and the environment is imperative."
MSGNN: Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network for Epidemic Forecasting,2023-08-30 00:00:00,"Mingjie Qiu, Zhiyi Tan, Bing-kun Bao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15840,"Infectious disease forecasting has been a key focus and proved to be crucial in controlling epidemic. A recent trend is to develop forecast-ing models based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNN-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) Current models broaden receptive fields by scaling the depth of GNNs, which is insuffi-cient to preserve the semantics of long-range connectivity between distant but epidemic related areas. (2) Previous approaches model epidemics within single spatial scale, while ignoring the multi-scale epidemic pat-terns derived from different scales. To address these deficiencies, we devise the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (MSGNN) based on an innovative multi-scale view. To be specific, in the proposed MSGNN model, we first devise a novel graph learning module, which directly captures long-range connectivity from trans-regional epidemic signals and integrates them into a multi-scale graph. Based on the learned multi-scale graph, we utilize a newly designed graph convolution module to exploit multi-scale epidemic patterns. This module allows us to facilitate multi-scale epidemic modeling by mining both scale-shared and scale-specific pat-terns. Experimental results on forecasting new cases of COVID-19 in United State demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-arts. Further analyses and visualization also show that MSGNN offers not only accurate, but also robust and interpretable forecasting result."
Semiparametric inference of effective reproduction number dynamics from wastewater pathogen surveillance data,2023-08-31 00:00:00,"Isaac H. Goldstein, Daniel M. Parker, Sunny Jiang, Volodymyr M. Minin",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15770,"Concentrations of pathogen genomes measured in wastewater have recently become available as a new data source to use when modeling the spread of infectious diseases. One promising use for this data source is inference of the effective reproduction number, the average number of individuals a newly infected person will infect. We propose a model where new infections arrive according to a time-varying immigration rate which can be interpreted as a compound parameter equal to the product of the proportion of susceptibles in the population and the transmission rate. This model allows us to estimate the effective reproduction number from concentrations of pathogen genomes while avoiding difficult to verify assumptions about the dynamics of the susceptible population. As a byproduct of our primary goal, we also produce a new model for estimating the effective reproduction number from case data using the same framework. We test this modeling framework in an agent-based simulation study with a realistic data generating mechanism which accounts for the time-varying dynamics of pathogen shedding. Finally, we apply our new model to estimating the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in Los Angeles, California, using pathogen RNA concentrations collected from a large wastewater treatment facility."
Generative Bayesian modeling to nowcast the effective reproduction number from line list data with missing symptom onset dates,2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Adrian Lison, Sam Abbott, Jana Huisman, Tanja Stadler",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13262,"The time-varying effective reproduction number $R_t$ is a widely used indicator of transmission dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Timely estimates of $R_t$ can be obtained from observations close to the original date of infection, such as the date of symptom onset. However, these data often have missing information and are subject to right truncation. Previous methods have addressed these problems independently by first imputing missing onset dates, then adjusting truncated case counts, and finally estimating the effective reproduction number. This stepwise approach makes it difficult to propagate uncertainty and can introduce subtle biases during real-time estimation due to the continued impact of assumptions made in previous steps. In this work, we integrate imputation, truncation adjustment, and $R_t$ estimation into a single generative Bayesian model, allowing direct joint inference of case counts and $R_t$ from line list data with missing symptom onset dates. We then use this framework to compare the performance of nowcasting approaches with different stepwise and generative components on synthetic line list data for multiple outbreak scenarios and across different epidemic phases. We find that under long reporting delays, intermediate smoothing, as is common practice in stepwise approaches, can bias nowcasts of case counts and $R_t$, which is avoided in a joint generative approach due to shared regularization of all model components. On incomplete line list data, a fully generative approach enables the quantification of uncertainty due to missing onset dates without the need for an initial multiple imputation step. In a real-world comparison using hospitalization line list data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, we observe the same qualitative differences between approaches. Our generative modeling components have been integrated into the R package epinowcast."
FaceTouch: Detecting hand-to-face touch with supervised contrastive learning to assist in tracing infectious disease,2023-08-24 00:00:00,"Mohamed R. Ibrahim, Terry Lyons",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12840,"Through our respiratory system, many viruses and diseases frequently spread and pass from one person to another. Covid-19 served as an example of how crucial it is to track down and cut back on contacts to stop its spread. There is a clear gap in finding automatic methods that can detect hand-to-face contact in complex urban scenes or indoors. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision framework, called FaceTouch, based on deep learning. It comprises deep sub-models to detect humans and analyse their actions. FaceTouch seeks to detect hand-to-face touches in the wild, such as through video chats, bus footage, or CCTV feeds. Despite partial occlusion of faces, the introduced system learns to detect face touches from the RGB representation of a given scene by utilising the representation of the body gestures such as arm movement. This has been demonstrated to be useful in complex urban scenarios beyond simply identifying hand movement and its closeness to faces. Relying on Supervised Contrastive Learning, the introduced model is trained on our collected dataset, given the absence of other benchmark datasets. The framework shows a strong validation in unseen datasets which opens the door for potential deployment."
Optimal Dorfman Group Testing For Symmetric Distributions,2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Nicholas C. Landolfi, Sanjay Lall",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11050,"We study Dorfman's classical group testing protocol in a novel setting where individual specimen statuses are modeled as exchangeable random variables. We are motivated by infectious disease screening. In that case, specimens which arrive together for testing often originate from the same community and so their statuses may exhibit positive correlation. Dorfman's protocol screens a population of n specimens for a binary trait by partitioning it into nonoverlapping groups, testing these, and only individually retesting the specimens of each positive group. The partition is chosen to minimize the expected number of tests under a probabilistic model of specimen statuses. We relax the typical assumption that these are independent and indentically distributed and instead model them as exchangeable random variables. In this case, their joint distribution is symmetric in the sense that it is invariant under permutations. We give a characterization of such distributions in terms of a function q where q(h) is the marginal probability that any group of size h tests negative. We use this interpretable representation to show that the set partitioning problem arising in Dorfman's protocol can be reduced to an integer partitioning problem and efficiently solved. We apply these tools to an empirical dataset from the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology helps explain the unexpectedly high empirical efficiency reported by the original investigators."
Incorporating Connectivity among Internet Search Data for Enhanced Influenza-like Illness Tracking,2023-08-19 00:00:00,"Shaoyang Ning, Ahmed Hussain, Qing Wang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10091,"Big data collected from the Internet possess great potential to reveal the ever-changing trends in society.

To this end, we propose ARGO-C (Augmented Regression with Clustered GOogle data), an integrative, statistically principled approach that incorporates the clustering structure of Internet search data to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of disease tracking. Focusing on multi-resolution %ILI (influenza-like illness) tracking, we demonstrate the improved performance and robustness of ARGO-C over benchmark methods at various geographical resolutions.

We model the VL trajectory by a multivariate normal distribution that accounts for possible correlation between measurements within individuals. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which treats the unknown time origins and the missing measurements as latent variables. Our main motivation is the reconstruction of the daily mean SARS-Cov-2 VL, given measurements performed on random patients, whose VL was measured multiple times on different days. The method is applied to SARS-Cov-2 cycle-threshold-value data collected in Israel."
Evolution of priorities in strategic funding for collaborative health research.

We investigated the impact of this trend on health research funded by the two leading funding bodies worldwide, i.e. the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and the framework programs of the European Union (EU). To this end, we performed a quantitative analysis of the content of projects supported through programmatic funding by the EU and NIH, in the period 2008-2014 and 2015-2020. We used machine learning for classification of projects as basic biomedical research, or as more implementation directed clinical therapeutic research, diagnostics research, population research, or policy and management research. In addition, we analyzed funding for major disease areas (cancer, cardio-metabolic and infectious disease). We found that EU collaborative health research projects clearly shifted towards more implementation research. In the US, the recently implemented UM1 program has a similar profile with strong clinical therapeutic research, while other NIH programs remain heavily oriented to basic biomedical research. Funding for cancer research is present across all NIH and EU programs, and in biomedical as well as more implementation directed projects, while infectious diseases is an emerging theme. We conclude that demand for solutions for medical needs leads to expanded funding for implementation- and impact-oriented research. Basic biomedical research remains present in programs driven by scientific initiative and strategies based on excellence, but may be at risk of declining funding opportunities."

We establish criteria for determining the existence of equilibrium points, which carry substantial biological significance. We establish the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf, saddle-node, and transcritical bifurcations by employing fear parameters as key bifurcation parameters. Furthermore, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the occurrence of multiple zero-Hopf (ZH) and saddle-node transcritical (SNTC) bifurcations around the endemic steady states by varying specific key parameters across the two-parametric plane. We demonstrate that the introduction of predator-induced fear, which hinders the growth rate of susceptible prey, can lead to the finite time extinction of an initially stable susceptible prey population. Finally, we discuss management strategies aimed at regulating disease transmission, focusing on fear-based interventions and selective predation via predator attack rate on infectious prey."
Clustering and Predicting Multiple Time Series Count Data via Mixture of Bayesian Predictive Syntheses: Analysis of COVID-19 Hospitalisation in Japan and Korea,2023-08-11 00:00:00,"Genya Kobayashi, Shonosuke Sugasawa, Yuki Kawakubo, Dongu Han, Taeryon Choi",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06134,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments and academia have made tremendous efforts to predict the course of the pandemic and implement prevention measures by monitoring various indicators. These indicators are obtained daily or weekly, and typically constitute time series count data over multiple sub-regions of a country, where groups of sub-regions often exhibit similar dynamics. This paper proposes a novel methodology called the mixture of Bayesian predictive syntheses (MBPS) to improve the predictive performance for such data by combining a set of predictive models and clustering the time series based on the contribution of those predictive models. MBPS takes the form of a finite mixture of dynamic factor models and is particularly useful when the multiple time series are discrete, as MBPS does not require multivariate count models, which are generally cumbersome to develop and implement. The clustering through MBPS provides valuable insights into the data and improves predictive performance by leveraging the share information within each cluster. Grouping multiple series into clusters also reduces the number of parameters needed compared to employing a multivariate model. To validate its efficacy, we apply the model to analyse the data on the numbers of COVID-19 inpatients and isolated individuals in Japan and Korea. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the agent methods in predictive accuracy. Moreover, the insights gained from our model provide valuable information for interpreting and diagnosing the analysis, contributing to the formulation of preventive measures for infectious diseases in the future."

In this work, stable Cu NP colloids were produced via femtosecond laser ablation of the metal target in water containing sodium citrate. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that the 32 nm mean size nanoparticles are mixtures of mainly metallic copper and copper (I) oxide Cu2O. Polyvinyl butyral was utilized as the binding agent for the spray-coated Cu NPs. The virucidal efficacy of such coatings containing different Cu content ranging from 2.9 at.% to 11.2 at.%. was confirmed against animal-origin coronavirus containing RNA, the agent of avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), and herpesvirus containing DNA, the agent of bovine herpesvirus (BoHV-1) infection. It was demonstrated that after a short time of exposure, the Cu NPs-based coatings do not have a toxic effect on the cell cultures while demonstrating a negative effect on the biological activity of both model viruses that was confirmed by quantification of the viruses via the determination of tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) virus titre and their viral nucleic acids via determination of threshold cycle (Ct) employing real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The assays showed that the decrease in TCID50 virus titre and increase in Ct values correlated with Cu content in Cu NPs-based coatings for both investigated viruses. Contact with coatings decreased IBV and BoHV-1 numbers from 99.42% to 100.00% and from 98.65% to 99.96% respectively. These findings suggest that Cu NPs show inhibitory effects leading to the inactivation of viruses and their nuclei regardless of the presence of a viral envelope."
Quantifying the spread of communicable diseases with immigration of infectious individuals,2023-08-03 00:00:00,"Sofía Guarello, Pablo Aguirre, Isabel Flores",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01988,"We construct a set of new epidemiological thresholds to address the general problem of spreading and containment of a disease with influx of infected individuals when the classic $\mathcal R_0$ is no longer meaningful. We provide analytical properties of these indices and illustrate their usefulness in a compartmental model of COVID-19 with data taken from Chile showing a good predictive potential when contrasted with the recorded disease behaviour. This approach and the associated analytical and numerical results allow us to quantify the severity of an immigration of infectious individuals into a community, and identification of the key parameters that are capable of changing or reversing the spread of an infectious disease in specific models."
A Framework for Incorporating Behavioural Change into Individual-Level Spatial Epidemic Models,2023-08-01 00:00:00,"Madeline A. Ward, Rob Deardon, Lorna E. Deeth",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00815,"During epidemics, people will often modify their behaviour patterns over time in response to changes in their perceived risk of spreading or contracting the disease. This can substantially impact the trajectory of the epidemic. However, most infectious disease models assume stable population behaviour due to the challenges of modelling these changes. We present a flexible new class of models, called behavioural change individual-level models (BC-ILMs), that incorporate both individual-level covariate information and a data-driven behavioural change effect. Focusing on spatial BC-ILMs, we consider four ""alarm"" functions to model the effect of behavioural change as a function of infection prevalence over time. We show how these models can be estimated in a simulation setting. We investigate the impact of misspecifying the alarm function when fitting a BC-ILM, and find that if behavioural change is present in a population, using an incorrect alarm function will still result in an improvement in posterior predictive performance over a model that assumes stable population behaviour. We also find that using spike and slab priors on alarm function parameters is a simple and effective method to determine whether a behavioural change effect is present in a population. Finally, we show results from fitting spatial BC-ILMs to data from the 2001 U.K. foot and mouth disease epidemic."
The contact process with an asymptomatic state,2023-08-01 00:00:00,"Nicolas Lanchier, Max Mercer",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00731,"In order to understand the role of a potentially high infectiousness of symptomatic individuals or, on the contrary, social distancing, quarantine, etc. in the course of an infectious disease, this paper introduces a natural variant of the popular contact process that distinguishes between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Infected individuals all recover at rate one but infect nearby individuals at a rate that depends on whether they show the symptoms of the disease or not. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and may or may not show the symptoms before they recover. The analysis of the corresponding mean-field model reveals that, in the absence of local interactions, regardless of the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, there is an epidemic whenever at least one of the infection rates is sufficiently large. In contrast, our analysis of the interacting particle system shows that, when the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic and the rate at which asymptomatic individuals infect nearby individuals are small, there cannot be any epidemic even when symptomatic individuals are highly infectious."
Cellular automata in the light of COVID-19,2023-07-31 00:00:00,"Sourav Chowdhury, Suparna Roychowdhury, Indranath Chaudhuri",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16423,"Currently, the world has been facing the brunt of a pandemic due to a disease called COVID-19 for the last 2 years. To study the spread of such infectious diseases it is important to not only understand their temporal evolution but also the spatial evolution. In this work, the spread of this disease has been studied with a cellular automata (CA) model to find the temporal and the spatial behavior of it. Here, we have proposed a neighborhood criteria which will help us to measure the social confinement at the time of the disease spread. The two main parameters of our model are (i) disease transmission probability (q) which helps us to measure the infectivity of a disease and (ii) exponent (n) which helps us to measure the degree of the social confinement. Here, we have studied various spatial growths of the disease by simulating this CA model. Finally we have tried to fit our model with the COVID-19 data of India for various waves and have attempted to match our model predictions with regards to each wave to see how the different parameters vary with respect to infectivity and restrictions in social interaction."

The mathematical modeling of infectious disease goes back to the 1760s when the famous mathematician Daniel Bernoulli used an elementary version of compartmental modeling to find the effectiveness of deliberate smallpox inoculation on life expectancy. We have used the well-known SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) model of Kermack & McKendrick to extend the analysis further by including exposure, quarantining, insusceptibility and deaths in a SEIQRDP model. Further, we have generalized this model by using the solutions of Fractional Differential Equations to test the accuracy and validity of the mathematical modeling techniques against Canadian COVID-19 trends and spread of real-world disease. Our work also emphasizes the importance of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and impact of social distancing on controlling the spread of COVID-19."
A Switching State-Space Transmission Model for Tracking Epidemics and Assessing Interventions,2023-07-30 00:00:00,"Jingxue Feng, Liangliang Wang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16138,"The effective control of infectious diseases relies on accurate assessment of the impact of interventions, which is often hindered by the complex dynamics of the spread of disease. We propose a Beta-Dirichlet switching state-space transmission model to track underlying dynamics of disease and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions simultaneously. As time evolves, the switching mechanism introduced in the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model is able to capture the timing and magnitude of changes in the transmission rate due to the effectiveness of control measures. The implementation of this model is based on a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which can estimate the time evolution of SEIR states, switching states, and high-dimensional parameters efficiently. The efficacy of our model and estimation procedure are demonstrated through simulation studies. With a real-world application to British Columbia's COVID-19 outbreak, it indicates approximately a 66.6\% reduction of transmission rate following interventions such as distancing, closures and vaccination. Our proposed model provides a promising tool to inform public health policies aimed at studying the underlying dynamics and evaluating of the effectiveness of interventions during the spread of the disease."
Integrative AI-Driven Strategies for Advancing Precision Medicine in Infectious Diseases and Beyond: A Novel Multidisciplinary Approach,2023-07-27 00:00:00,"Ghizal fatima, Risala H.

Simulating the spread of COVID-19 with cellular automata: A new approach,2023-07-26 00:00:00,"Sourav Chowdhury, Suparna Roychowdhury, Indranath Chaudhuri",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14576,"Between the years 2020 to 2022, the world was hit by the pandemic of COVID-19 giving rise to an extremely grave situation. The global economy was badly hurt due to the consequences of various intervention strategies (like social distancing, lockdown) which were applied by different countries to control this pandemic. There are multiple speculations that humanity will again face such pandemics in the future. Thus it is very important to learn and gain knowledge about the spread of such infectious diseases and the various factors which are responsible for it. In this study, we have extended our previous work (Chowdhury et.al., 2022) on the probabilistic cellular automata (CA) model to reproduce the spread of COVID-19 in several countries by modifying its earlier used neighbourhood criteria. This modification gives us the liberty to adopt the effect of different restrictions like lockdown and social distancing in our model. We have done some theoretical analysis for initial infection and simulations to gain insights into our model. We have also studied the data from eight countries for COVID-19 in a window of 876 days and compared it with our model. We have developed a proper framework to fit our model on the data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 and have also re-checked the goodness of the fit with the data of the deceased cases for this pandemic. This model fits well with different peaks of COVID-19 data for all the eight countries and can be possibly generalized for a global prediction."
Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be biased in spatially structured populations,2023-07-25 00:00:00,"Piero Birello, Michele Re Fiorentin, Boxuan Wang, Vittoria Colizza, Eugenio Valdano",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13798,"An accurate and timely estimate of the reproduction ratio R of an infectious disease epidemic is crucial to make projections on its evolution and set up the appropriate public health response. Estimates of R routinely come from statistical inference on timelines of cases or their proxies like symptomatic cases, hospitalizatons, deaths. Here, however, we prove that these estimates of R may not be accurate if the population is made up of spatially distinct communities, as the interplay between space and mobility may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. This means that surveillance may underestimate R over long periods, to the point of mistaking a growing epidemic for a subsiding one, misinforming public health response. To overcome this, we propose a correction to be applied to surveillance data that removes this bias and ensures an accurate estimate of R across all epidemic phases. We use COVID-19 as case study; our results, however, apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation, including major challenges of the next decades: respiratory infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, emerging pathogens), vector-borne diseases (arboviruses). Our findings will help set up public health response to these threats, by improving epidemic monitoring and surveillance."
Statistical properties of COVID-19 transmission intervals in Republic of Korea,2023-07-25 00:00:00,"Yeonji Seo, Okyu Kwon, Hang-Hyun Jo",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13508,"A transmission interval for an infectious disease is important to understand epidemic processes in complex networks. The transmission interval is defined as a time interval between one person's infection and their infection to another person. To study statistical properties of transmission intervals, we analyze a COVID-19 dataset of confirmed cases in Republic of Korea that has been collected for two years since the confirmation of the first case on 19 January 2020. Utilizing demographic information of confirmed individuals, such as sex, age, residence location, and the nature of relation between infectors and infectees, we find that transmission intervals are rarely affected by sexes, but they tend to have larger values for the youngest and oldest age groups than other groups. We also find some metropolitan cities or provinces with relatively larger (smaller) transmission intervals than other locations. These empirical findings might help us to better understand dynamical mechanisms of epidemic processes in complex social systems."
Limited efficacy of forward contact tracing in epidemics,2023-10-18 00:00:00,"Giulia de Meijere, Claudio Castellano",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11506,"Infectious diseases that spread silently through asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections represent a challenge for policy makers. A traditional way of achieving isolation of silent infectors from the community is through forward contact tracing, aiming at identifying individuals that might have been infected by a known infected person. In this work we investigate how efficient this measure is in preventing a disease from becoming endemic. We introduce an SIS-based compartmental model where symptomatic individuals may self-isolate and trigger a contact tracing process aimed at quarantining asymptomatic infected individuals. Imperfect adherence and delays affect both measures. We derive the epidemic threshold analytically and find that contact tracing alone can only lead to a very limited increase of the threshold. We quantify the effect of imperfect adherence and the impact of incentivizing asymptomatic and symptomatic populations to adhere to isolation. Our analytical results are confirmed by simulations on complex networks and by the numerical analysis of a much more complex model incorporating more realistic in-host disease progression."
SecureTrack- A contact tracing IoT platform for monitoring infectious diseases,2023-07-18 00:00:00,"Shobhit Aggarwal, Arnab Purkayastha",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10311,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for innovative solutions to monitor and control the spread of infectious diseases. With the potential for future pandemics and the risk of outbreaks particularly in academic institutions, there is a pressing need for effective approaches to monitor and manage such diseases. Contact tracing using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) has been found to be the most prevalent method to detect and tackle the extent of outbreaks during the pandemic. However, these services suffer from the inherent problems of infringement of data privacy that creates hindrance in adoption of the technology. Non-cellular wireless technologies on the other hand are well-suited to provide secure contact tracing methods. Such approaches integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) have a great potential to aid in the fight against any type of infectious diseases. In response, we present a unique approach that utilizes an IoT based generic framework to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, using contact tracing methods, without compromising the privacy aspect. We develop the architecture of our platform, including both the frontend and backend components, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying potential COVID-19 exposures (as a test case) through a proof-of-concept implementation. We also implement and verify a prototype of the device. Our framework is easily deployable and can be scaled up as needed with the existing infrastructure."
Toward a comprehensive system for constructing compartmental epidemic models,2023-07-18 00:00:00,"Darren Flynn-Primrose, Steven C. Walker, Michael Li, Benjamin M. Bolker, David J. D. Earn, Jonathan Dushoff",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10308,"Compartmental models are valuable tools for investigating infectious diseases. Researchers building such models typically begin with a simple structure where compartments correspond to individuals with different epidemiological statuses, e.g., the classic SIR model which splits the population into susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments. However, as more information about a specific pathogen is discovered, or as a means to investigate the effects of heterogeneities, it becomes useful to stratify models further -- for example by age, geographic location, or pathogen strain. The operation of constructing stratified compartmental models from a pair of simpler models resembles the Cartesian product used in graph theory, but several key differences complicate matters. In this article we give explicit mathematical definitions for several so-called ``model products'' and provide examples where each is suitable. We also provide examples of model stratification where no existing model product will generate the desired result."
A Look into Causal Effects under Entangled Treatment in Graphs: Investigating the Impact of Contact on MRSA Infection,2023-07-17 00:00:00,"Jing Ma, Chen Chen, Anil Vullikanti, Ritwick Mishra, Gregory Madden, Daniel Borrajo, Jundong Li",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08237,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of bacteria resistant to certain antibiotics, making it difficult to prevent MRSA infections. Among decades of efforts to conquer infectious diseases caused by MRSA, many studies have been proposed to estimate the causal effects of close contact (treatment) on MRSA infection (outcome) from observational data. In this problem, the treatment assignment mechanism plays a key role as it determines the patterns of missing counterfactuals -- the fundamental challenge of causal effect estimation. Most existing observational studies for causal effect learning assume that the treatment is assigned individually for each unit. However, on many occasions, the treatments are pairwisely assigned for units that are connected in graphs, i.e., the treatments of different units are entangled. Neglecting the entangled treatments can impede the causal effect estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of causal effect estimation with treatment entangled in a graph. Despite a few explorations for entangled treatments, this problem still remains challenging due to the following challenges: (1) the entanglement brings difficulties in modeling and leveraging the unknown treatment assignment mechanism; (2) there may exist hidden confounders which lead to confounding biases in causal effect estimation; (3) the observational data is often time-varying. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method NEAT, which explicitly leverages the graph structure to model the treatment assignment mechanism, and mitigates confounding biases based on the treatment assignment modeling. We also extend our method into a dynamic setting to handle time-varying observational data. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world MRSA dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and provide insights for future applications."
Nowcasting Temporal Trends Using Indirect Surveys,2023-12-14 00:00:00,"Ajitesh Srivastava, Juan Marcos Ramírez, Sergio Díaz-Aranda, Jose Aguilar, Antonio Ortega, Antonio Fernández Anta, Rosa Elvira Lillo",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06643,"Indirect surveys, in which respondents provide information about other people they know, have been proposed for estimating (nowcasting) the size of a \emph{hidden population} where privacy is important or the hidden population is hard to reach. Examples include estimating casualties in an earthquake, conditions among female sex workers, and the prevalence of drug use and infectious diseases. The Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) is the classical approach to developing estimates from indirect surveys, but it was designed for one-shot surveys. Further, it requires certain assumptions and asking for or estimating the number of individuals in each respondent's network. In recent years, surveys have been increasingly deployed online and can collect data continuously (e.g., COVID-19 surveys on Facebook during much of the pandemic). Conventional NSUM can be applied to these scenarios by analyzing the data independently at each point in time, but this misses the opportunity of leveraging the temporal dimension. We propose to use the responses from indirect surveys collected over time and develop analytical tools (i) to prove that indirect surveys can provide better estimates for the trends of the hidden population over time, as compared to direct surveys and (ii) to identify appropriate temporal aggregations to improve the estimates. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that our approach outperforms traditional NSUM and direct surveying methods. We also empirically demonstrate the superiority of our approach on a real indirect survey dataset of COVID-19 cases."
COVID-19 incidence in the Republic of Ireland: A case study for network-based time series models,2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Stephanie Armbruster, Gesine Reinert",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06199,"Network-based Time Series models have experienced a surge in popularity over the past years due to their ability to model temporal and spatial dependencies such as arising from the spread of an infectious disease. As statistical models for network time series, generalised network autoregressive (GNAR) models have been introduced. GNAR models are vertex-based models which have an autoregressive component modelling temporal dependence and a spatial autoregressive component to incorporate dependence between neighbouring vertices in the network. This paper compares the performance of GNAR models with different underlying networks in predicting COVID-19 cases for the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland. The dataset is separated into subsets according to inter-country movement regulations and categorized into two pandemic phases, restricted and unrestricted. Ten static networks are constructed based on either general or COVID-19 specific approaches. In these networks, vertices represent counties, and edges are built upon neighbourhood relations, such as railway lines. We find that while for the prediction task, no underlying static network is consistently superior for either restricted or unrestricted phase, for pandemic phases with restrictions sparse networks perform better while for unrestricted phases, dense networks explain the data better. GNAR models have higher predictive accuracy than ARIMA models, which ignore the network structure. ARIMA and GNAR models perform similarly in pandemic phases with more lenient or no COVID-19 regulation. These findings indicate evidence of network dependencies in the restricted phase, but not in the unrestricted phase. They also show some robustness regarding the network construction method. An analysis of the residuals justifies the model assumptions for the restricted phase but raises questions for the unrestricted phase."
Analysis of a competitive respiratory disease system with quarantine,2023-07-11 00:00:00,"Anna Daniel Fome, Wolfgang Bock, Axel Klar",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05044,"In the world of epidemics, the mathematical modeling of disease co-infection is gaining importance due to its contributions to mathematics and public health. Because the co-infection may have a double burden on families, countries, and the universe, understanding its dynamics is paramount. We study a SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered) deterministic epidemic model with a single host population and multiple strains (-$c$ and -$i$) to account for two competitive diseases with quarantine effects. To model the role of quarantine and isolation efficacy in disease dynamics, we utilize a linear function. Further, we shed light on the standard endemic threshold and determine the conditions for extinction or coexistence with and without forming co-infection. Next, we show the dependence of the criticality based on specific parameters of the different pathogens. We found that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the single-strain model always exists and is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) if $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_k^q\leq 1$, else, a stable endemic equilibrium. On top of that, the model has forward bifurcation at $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}_k^q = 1$. In the case of a two-strain model, the strain with a large reproduction number outcompetes the one with a smaller reproduction number. Further, if the co-infected quarantine reproduction number is less than one, the infections of already infected individuals will die out, and co-infection will persist in the population otherwise. We note that the quarantine and isolation of exposed and infected individuals will reduce the number of secondary cases below one, consequently reducing the disease complications if the total number of people in the quarantine is at most the critical value."
Predicting Tuberculosis from Real-World Cough Audio Recordings and Metadata,2023-07-12 00:00:00,"George P. Kafentzis, Stephane Tetsing, Joe Brew, Lola Jover, Mindaugas Galvosas, Carlos Chaccour, Peter M. Small",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04842,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs, as well as other body parts. TB is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Medical doctors diagnose TB in patients via clinical examinations and specialized tests. However, coughing is a common symptom of respiratory diseases such as TB. Literature suggests that cough sounds coming from different respiratory diseases can be distinguished by both medical doctors and computer algorithms. Therefore, cough recordings associated with patients with and without TB seems to be a reasonable avenue of investigation. In this work, we utilize a very large dataset of TB and non-TB cough audio recordings obtained from the south-east of Africa, India, and the south-east of Asia using a fully automated phone-based application (Hyfe), without manual annotation. We fit statistical classifiers based on spectral and time domain features with and without clinical metadata. A stratified grouped cross-validation approach shows that an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of approximately 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 both for a cough-level and a participant-level classification can be achieved using cough sounds alone. The addition of demographic and clinical factors increases performance, resulting in an average AUC of approximately 0.81 $\pm$ 0.05. Our results suggest mobile phone-based applications that integrate clinical symptoms and cough sound analysis could help community health workers and, most importantly, health service programs to improve TB case-finding efforts while reducing costs, which could substantially improve public health."
The strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity,2023-07-10 00:00:00,"Takayuki Hiraoka, Abbas K. Rizi, Zahra Ghadiri, Mikko Kivelä, Jari Saramäki",https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700,"When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the risk of widespread outbreaks decreases non-linearly as a result of the collective protection known as herd immunity. Typically, immunity to a disease can be acquired through natural infection or vaccination. It has been argued that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce a stronger herd immunity effect than homogeneous vaccination, because the early stages of transmission would primarily affect highly interactive individuals, leading to more efficient suppression of subsequent infections. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the herd immunity effect by analyzing the behavior of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on static contact networks. We find that the effectiveness of disease-induced herd immunity is shaped by two competing mechanisms: While it exploits degree heterogeneity in the contact network to efficiently target highly connected individuals for immunity, it also introduces mixing heterogeneity between immune and susceptible individuals, weakening herd immunity. By controlling the degree of spatial embeddedness of the contact network structure, we find that spatial structure generally makes herd immunity stronger and also enhances the advantage of the herd immunity effect induced by random immunization over the disease-induced one in networks with low degree heterogeneity. These findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of herd immunity and have implications for designing effective disease control strategies."
