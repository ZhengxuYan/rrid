Inform: From Compartmental Models to Stochastic Bounded Counter Machines,2024-02-14 00:00:00,"Tim Leys, Guillermo A. Perez",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09121,"Compartmental models are used in epidemiology to capture the evolution of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in a population by assigning members of it to compartments with labels such as susceptible, infected, and recovered. In a stochastic compartmental model the flow of individuals between compartments is determined probabilistically. We establish that certain stochastic compartment models can be encoded as probabilistic counter machines where the configurations are bounded. Based on the latter, we obtain simple descriptions of the models in the PRISM language. This enables the analysis of such compartmental models via probabilistic model checkers. Finally, we report on experimental results where we analyze results from a Belgian COVID-19 model using a probabilistic model checkers."
Preserving system activity while controlling epidemic spreading in adaptive temporal networks,2024-02-14 00:00:00,"Marco Mancastroppa, Alessandro Vezzani, Vittoria Colizza, Raffaella Burioni",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09076,"Human behaviour strongly influences the spread of infectious diseases: understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and adaptive behaviours is essential to improve response strategies to epidemics, with the goal of containing the epidemic while preserving a sufficient level of operativeness in the population. Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations."
An integral renewal equation approach to behavioural epidemic models with information index,2024-02-13 00:00:00,"Bruno Buonomo, Eleonora Messina, Claudia Panico, Antonia Vecchio",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08618,"We propose an integral model describing an epidemic of an infectious disease. The model is behavioural in the sense that the constitutive law for the force of infection includes a distributed delay, called ""information index"", that describes the opinion-driven human behavioural changes. The information index, in turn, contains a memory kernel to mimic how the individuals maintain memory of the past values of the infection. We obtain sufficient conditions for the endemic equilibrium to be locally stable. In particular, we show that when the infectivity function is represented by an exponential distribution, stability is guaranteed by the weak Erlang memory kernel. However, through numerical simulations, we show that self-sustained oscillations may arise when the memory is more focused in the disease's past history, as exemplified by the strong Erlang kernel. We also show the model solutions in cases of different infectivity functions describing infectious diseases like influenza and SARS."
Extending Inferences from Randomized Clinical Trials to Target Populations Using Observational Data: A Scoping Review of Transportability Methods,2024-02-11 00:00:00,"Guanbo Wang, Ting-Wei Ernie Liao, David Furfaro, Leo Anthony Celi, Kevin Sheng-Kai Ma",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07236,"Objective: Randomized clinical trial (RCT) results often define clinical decision making, but the highly curated populations of trails, and the rigorous methodology utilized, are often not reflective of real-world practice. The objective of this scoping review is to identify the ability of practical methods to transport findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to target populations. Study design: A scoping review was conducted on the literature regarding transportability from RCTs to observational data cohorts. Each study was assessed for the transportability methodology used, and to what degree the RCT treatment effect (estimated target parameter) was seen in the target population (intended patients) in observational data. Results: A total of 15 published papers were included. The research topics include cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, psychiatry, oncology, orthopedics, anesthesiology, and hematology. These studies show that the outcomes from RCTs could be extended to real-world settings, with varying degrees of effect size and precision. However, in some cases, the estimated target parameters for the target population were statistically significantly different from those in clinical trials. Conclusion: Despite variations in the magnitude of effects between RCTs and real-world studies, transportability methods can play an important role in effectively bridging the gap between clinical research and practical healthcare applications, offering valuable insights for evidence-based medicine."
Discrete-time staged progression epidemic models,2024-02-07 00:00:00,"Luis Sanz-Lorenzo, Rafael Bravo de la Parra",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04899,"In the Staged Progression (SP) epidemic models, infected individuals are classified into a suitable number of states. The goal of these models is to describe as closely as possible the effect of differences in infectiousness exhibited by individuals going through the different stages. The main objective of this work is to study, from the methodological point of view, the behavior of solutions of the discrete time SP models without reinfection and with a general incidence function. Besides calculating $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, we find bounds for the epidemic final size, characterize the asymptotic behavior of the infected classes, give results about the final monotonicity of the infected classes, and obtain results regarding the initial dynamics of the prevalence of the disease. Moreover, we incorporate into the model the probability distribution of the number of contacts in order to make the model amenable to study its effect in the dynamics of the disease."
Discrete epidemic models with two time scales,2024-02-06 00:00:00,"Luis Sanz-Lorenzo, Rafael Bravo de la Parra",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03958,"The main aim of the work is to present a general class of two time scales discrete-time epidemic models. In the proposed framework the disease dynamics is considered to act on a slower time scale than a second different process that could represent movements between spatial locations, changes of individual activities or behaviours, or others. To include a sufficiently general disease model, we first build up from first principles a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model and characterize the eradication or endemicity of the disease with the help of its basic reproduction number R0. Then, we propose a general full model that includes sequentially the two processes at different time scales, and proceed to its analysis through a reduced model. The basic reproduction number R0 of the reduced system gives a good approximation of the R0 of the full model since it serves at analyzing its asymptotic behaviour. As an illustration of the proposed general framework, it is shown that there exist conditions under which a locally endemic disease, considering isolated patches in a metapopulation, can be eradicated globally by establishing the appropriate movements between patches."
"Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale: Factorial structure, reliability, and validity in times of Portugal's COVID-19 pandemic lockdown",2024-02-05 00:00:00,"Ana Paula Martins, María C. Vega-Hernández, Francisca Ribeiro Soares, Rosa Marina Afonso",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03108,"The present study examines the factor structure of a Portuguese version of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVD), designed to assess individual differences in chronic concerns about transmission of infectious diseases. Method: Data from a Portuguese convenience sample (n=1203), collected during the first Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Results: the scale revealed, through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a slight superiority of a three-factor model over the existing two-factor models of the 15-item original PVD and of the 10-item PVD established with another Portuguese sample (Ferreira et al., 2022). Conclusions: This higher level of differentiation in terms of a perceived resistance to infectious diseases could be explained by the pandemic context which may have differentiated the responses regarding the perception of Resistance. On the other hand, this new factor increases the comprehensive and evaluative dimension and implications of the construct assessed by PVD."
Epidemics on Networks,2024-02-03 00:00:00,"Jan Kreischer, Adrian Iten, Astrid Jehoul",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02234,"Despite centuries of work on containment and mitigation strategies, infectious diseases are still a major problem facing humanity. This work is concerned with simulating heterogeneous contact structures and understanding how the structure of the underlying network affects the spread of the disease. For example, it has been empirically demonstrated and validated that scale free networks do not have an epidemic threshold. Understanding the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics can help to develop better mitigation strategies and more effective interventions."
Modeling how and why aquatic vegetation removal can free rural households from poverty-disease traps,2024-01-30 00:00:00,"Molly J Doruska, Christopher B Barrett, Jason R Rohr",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17384,"Infectious disease can reduce labor productivity and incomes, trapping subpopulations in a vicious cycle of ill health and poverty. Efforts to boost African farmers' agricultural production through fertilizer use can inadvertently promote the growth of aquatic vegetation that hosts disease vectors. Recent trials established that removing aquatic vegetation habitat for snail intermediate hosts reduces schistosomiasis infection rates in children, while converting the harvested vegetation into compost boosts agricultural productivity and incomes. Our model illustrates how this ecological intervention changes the feedback between the human and natural systems, potentially freeing rural households from poverty-disease traps. We develop a bioeconomic model that interacts an analytical microeconomic model of agricultural households' behavior, health status and incomes over time with a dynamic model of schistosomiasis disease ecology. We calibrate the model with field data from northern Senegal. We show analytically and via simulation that local conversion of invasive aquatic vegetation to compost changes the feedbacks among interlinked disease, aquatic and agricultural systems, reducing schistosomiasis infection and increasing incomes relative to the current status quo, in which villagers rarely remove vegetation. Aquatic vegetation removal disrupts the poverty-disease trap by reducing habitat for snails that vector the infectious helminth and by promoting production of compost that returns to agricultural soils nutrients that currently leach into surface water from on-farm fertilizer applications. The result is healthier people, more productive labor, cleaner water, more productive agriculture, and higher incomes."
Meta-Learning for Neural Network-based Temporal Point Processes,2024-01-28 00:00:00,"Yoshiaki Takimoto, Yusuke Tanaka, Tomoharu Iwata, Maya Okawa, Hideaki Kim, Hiroyuki Toda, Takeshi Kurashima",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15846,"Human activities generate various event sequences such as taxi trip records, bike-sharing pick-ups, crime occurrence, and infectious disease transmission. The point process is widely used in many applications to predict such events related to human activities. However, point processes present two problems in predicting events related to human activities. First, recent high-performance point process models require the input of sufficient numbers of events collected over a long period (i.e., long sequences) for training, which are often unavailable in realistic situations. Second, the long-term predictions required in real-world applications are difficult. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel meta-learning approach for periodicity-aware prediction of future events given short sequences. The proposed method first embeds short sequences into hidden representations (i.e., task representations) via recurrent neural networks for creating predictions from short sequences. It then models the intensity of the point process by monotonic neural networks (MNNs), with the input being the task representations. We transfer the prior knowledge learned from related tasks and can improve event prediction given short sequences of target tasks. We design the MNNs to explicitly take temporal periodic patterns into account, contributing to improved long-term prediction performance. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has higher prediction performance than existing alternatives."
Limited data on infectious disease distribution exposes ambiguity in epidemic modeling choices,2024-01-26 00:00:00,"Laura Di Domenico, Eugenio Valdano, Vittoria Colizza",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15190,"Traditional disease transmission models assume that the infectious period is exponentially distributed with a recovery rate fixed in time and across individuals. This assumption provides analytical and computational advantages, however it is often unrealistic. Efforts in modeling non-exponentially distributed infectious periods are either limited to special cases or lead to unsolvable models. Also, the link between empirical data (infectious period distribution) and the modeling needs (corresponding recovery rates) lacks a clear understanding. Here we introduce a mapping of an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods into a distribution of recovery rates. We show that the same infectious period distribution at the population level can be reproduced by two modeling schemes -- host-based and population-based -- depending on the individual response to the infection, and aggregated empirical data cannot easily discriminate the correct scheme. Besides being conceptually different, the two schemes also lead to different epidemic trajectories. Although sharing the same behavior close to the disease-free equilibrium, the host-based scheme deviates from the expected epidemic when reaching the endemic equilibrium of an SIS transmission model, while the population-based scheme turns out to be equivalent to assuming a homogeneous recovery rate. We show this through analytical computations and stochastic epidemic simulations on a contact network, using both generative network models and empirical contact data. It is therefore possible to reproduce heterogeneous infectious periods in network-based transmission models, however the resulting prevalence is sensitive to the modeling choice for the interpretation of the empirically collected data on infection duration. In absence of higher resolution data, studies should acknowledge such deviations in the epidemic predictions."
Early Detection of Treatments Side Effect: A Sequential Approach,2024-01-24 00:00:00,"Jiayue Wang, Ben Boukai",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13760,"With the emergence and spread of infectious diseases with pandemic potential, such as COVID- 19, the urgency for vaccine development have led to unprecedented compressed and accelerated schedules that shortened the standard development timeline. In a relatively short time, the leading pharmaceutical companies1, received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccine\prime s en-mass deployment To monitor the potential side effect(s) of the vaccine during the (initial) vaccination campaign, we developed an optimal sequential test that allows for the early detection of potential side effect(s). This test employs a rule to stop the vaccination process once the observed number of side effect incidents exceeds a certain (pre-determined) threshold. The optimality of the proposed sequential test is justified when compared with the (α, β) optimality of the non-randomized fixed-sample Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) test. In the case of a single side effect, we study the properties of the sequential test and derive the exact expressions of the Average Sample Number (ASN) curve of the stopping time (and its variance) via the regularized incomplete beta function. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the relative savings in ASN as compared to maximal sample size. Moreover, we construct the post-test parameter estimate and studied its sampling properties, including its asymptotic behavior under local-type alternatives. These limiting behavior results are the consistency and asymptotic normality of the post-test parameter estimator. We conclude the paper with a small simulation study illustrating the asymptotic performance of the point and interval estimation and provide a detailed example, based on COVID-19 side effect data (see Beatty et al. (2021)) of our suggested testing procedure."
Network Based Approach Estimating COVID-19 Spread Patterns,2024-01-23 00:00:00,"Jiarui Dong, Guanghao Ran",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12552,"In this study, we construct a series of evolving epidemic networks by measuring the correlations of daily COVID-19 cases time series among 3,105 counties in the United States. Remarkably, through quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of these entities in different networks, we identify four typical patterns of COVID-19 transmission in the United States from March 2020 to February 2023. The onsets and wanes of these patterns are closely associated with significant events in the COVID-19 timeline. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth qualitative and quantitative research on the spread of the epidemic at the county and state levels, tracing and analyzing the evolution and characteristics of specific propagation pathways. Overall, our research breaks away from traditional infectious disease models and provides a macroscopic perspective on the evolution in epidemic transmission patterns. This highlights the remarkable potential of utilizing complex network methods for macroscopic studies of infectious diseases."
A method for characterizing disease emergence curves from paired pathogen detection and serology data,2024-01-18 00:00:00,"Joshua Hewitt, Grete Wilson-Henjum, Derek T. Collins, Jourdan M. Ringenberg, Christopher A. Quintanal, Robert Pleszewski, Jeffrey C. Chandler, Thomas J. DeLiberto, Kim M. Pepin",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10057,"Wildlife disease surveillance programs and research studies track infection and identify risk factors for wild populations, humans, and agriculture. Often, several types of samples are collected from individuals to provide more complete information about an animal's infection history. Methods that jointly analyze multiple data streams to study disease emergence and drivers of infection via epidemiological process models remain underdeveloped. Joint-analysis methods can more thoroughly analyze all available data, more precisely quantifying epidemic processes, outbreak status, and risks. We contribute a paired data modeling approach that analyzes multiple samples from individuals. We use ""characterization maps"" to link paired data to epidemiological processes through a hierarchical statistical observation model. Our approach can provide both Bayesian and frequentist estimates of epidemiological parameters and state. We motivate our approach through the need to use paired pathogen and antibody detection tests to estimate parameters and infection trajectories for the widely applicable susceptible, infectious, recovered (SIR) model. We contribute general formulas to link characterization maps to arbitrary process models and datasets and an extended SIR model that better accommodates paired data. We find via simulation that paired data can more efficiently estimate SIR parameters than unpaired data, requiring samples from 5-10 times fewer individuals. We then study SARS-CoV-2 in wild White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from three counties in the United States. Estimates for average infectious times corroborate captive animal studies. Our methods use general statistical theory to let applications extend beyond the SIR model we consider, and to more complicated examples of paired data."
Enabling Collaborative Clinical Diagnosis of Infectious Keratitis by Integrating Expert Knowledge and Interpretable Data-driven Intelligence,2024-01-13 00:00:00,"Zhengqing Fang, Shuowen Zhou, Zhouhang Yuan, Yuxuan Si, Mengze Li, Jinxu Li, Yesheng Xu, Wenjia Xie, Kun Kuang, Yingming Li, Fei Wu, Yu-Feng Yao",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08695,"Although data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) in medical image diagnosis has shown impressive performance in silico, the lack of interpretability makes it difficult to incorporate the ""black box"" into clinicians' workflows. To make the diagnostic patterns learned from data understandable by clinicians, we develop an interpretable model, knowledge-guided diagnosis model (KGDM), that provides a visualized reasoning process containing AI-based biomarkers and retrieved cases that with the same diagnostic patterns. It embraces clinicians' prompts into the interpreted reasoning through human-AI interaction, leading to potentially enhanced safety and more accurate predictions. This study investigates the performance, interpretability, and clinical utility of KGDM in the diagnosis of infectious keratitis (IK), which is the leading cause of corneal blindness. The classification performance of KGDM is evaluated on a prospective validation dataset, an external testing dataset, and an publicly available testing dataset. The diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) of the interpreted AI-based biomarkers are effective, ranging from 3.011 to 35.233 and exhibit consistent diagnostic patterns with clinic experience. Moreover, a human-AI collaborative diagnosis test is conducted and the participants with collaboration achieved a performance exceeding that of both humans and AI. By synergistically integrating interpretability and interaction, this study facilitates the convergence of clinicians' expertise and data-driven intelligence. The promotion of inexperienced ophthalmologists with the aid of AI-based biomarkers, as well as increased AI prediction by intervention from experienced ones, demonstrate a promising diagnostic paradigm for infectious keratitis using KGDM, which holds the potential for extension to other diseases where experienced medical practitioners are limited and the safety of AI is concerned."
A Large-Scale Epidemic Simulation Framework for Realistic Social Contact Networks,2024-01-16 00:00:00,"Joy Kitson, Ian Costello, Jiangzhuo Chen, Diego Jiménez, Stefan Hoops, Henning Mortveit, Esteban Meneses, Jae-Seung Yeom, Madhav V. Marathe, Abhinav Bhatele",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08124,"Global pandemics can wreak havoc and lead to significant social, economic, and personal losses. Preventing the spread of infectious diseases requires implementing interventions at different levels of government, and evaluating the potential impact and efficacy of those preemptive measures. Agent-based modeling can be used for detailed studies of epidemic diffusion and possible interventions. We present Loimos, a highly parallel simulation of epidemic diffusion written on top of Charm++, an asynchronous task-based parallel runtime. Loimos uses a hybrid of time-stepping and discrete-event simulation to model disease spread. We demonstrate that our implementation of Loimos is able to scale to large core counts on an HPC system. In particular, Loimos is able to simulate a US-scale synthetic interaction network in an average of 1.497 seconds per simulation day when executed on 16 nodes on Rivanna at the University of Virginia, processing around 428 billion interactions (person-person edges) in under five minutes for an average of 1.4 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS)."
Approximate Inference for Longitudinal Mechanistic HIV Contact Networks,2024-01-09 00:00:00,"Octavious Smiley, Till Hoffmann, Jukka-Pekka Onnela",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04775,"Network models are increasingly used to study infectious disease spread. Exponential Random Graph models have a history in this area, with scalable inference methods now available. An alternative approach uses mechanistic network models. Mechanistic network models directly capture individual behaviors, making them suitable for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Combining mechanistic models with Approximate Bayesian Computation allows flexible modeling using domain-specific interaction rules among agents, avoiding network model oversimplifications. These models are ideal for longitudinal settings as they explicitly incorporate network evolution over time. We implemented a discrete-time version of a previously published continuous-time model of evolving contact networks for men who have sex with men (MSM) and proposed an ABC-based approximate inference scheme for it. As expected, we found that a two-wave longitudinal study design improves the accuracy of inference compared to a cross-sectional design. However, the gains in precision in collecting data twice, up to 18%, depend on the spacing of the two waves and are sensitive to the choice of summary statistics. In addition to methodological developments, our results inform the design of future longitudinal network studies in sexually transmitted diseases, specifically in terms of what data to collect from participants and when to do so."
On the Target Detection Performance of a Molecular Communication Network with Multiple Mobile Nanomachines,2024-01-09 00:00:00,"Nithin V. Sabu, Abhishek K. Gupta",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04636,"A network of nanomachines (NMs) can be used to build a target detection system for a variety of promising applications. They have the potential to detect toxic chemicals, infectious bacteria, and biomarkers of dangerous diseases such as cancer within the human body. Many diseases and health disorders can be detected early and efficiently treated in the future by utilizing these systems. To fully grasp the potential of these systems, mathematical analysis is required. This paper describes an analytical framework for modeling and analyzing the performance of target detection systems composed of multiple mobile nanomachines of varying sizes with passive/absorbing boundaries. We consider both direct contact detection, in which NMs must physically contact the target to detect it, and indirect sensing, in which NMs must detect the marker molecules emitted by the target. The detection performance of such systems is calculated for degradable and non-degradable targets, as well as mobile and stationary targets. The derived expressions provide various insights, such as the effect of NM density and target degradation on detection probability."
A New Cure Rate Model with Discrete and Multiple Exposures,2024-01-08 00:00:00,Suvra Pal,https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04240,"Cure rate models are mostly used to study data arising from cancer clinical trials. Its use in the context of infectious diseases has not been explored well. In 2008, Tournoud and Ecochard first proposed a mechanistic formulation of cure rate model in the context of infectious diseases with multiple exposures to infection. However, they assumed a simple Poisson distribution to capture the unobserved pathogens at each exposure time. In this paper, we propose a new cure rate model to study infectious diseases with discrete multiple exposures to infection. Our formulation captures both over-dispersion and under-dispersion with respect to the count on pathogens at each time of exposure. We also propose a new estimation method based on the expectation maximization algorithm to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We carry out a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and estimation algorithm. The flexibility of our proposed model also allows us to carry out a model discrimination. For this purpose, we use both likelihood ratio test and information-based criteria. Finally, we illustrate our proposed model using a recently collected data on COVID-19."
Patient-Oriented Unsupervised Learning to Unlock Patterns of Multimorbidity Associated with Stroke using Primary Care Electronic Health Records,2024-01-03 00:00:00,"Marc Delord, Xiaohui Sun, Annastazia Learoyd, Vasa Curcin, Iain Marshall, Charles Wolfe, Mark Ashworth, Abdel Douiri",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01870,Background: Identifying and characterising the longitudinal patterns of multimorbidity associated with stroke is needed to better understand patients' needs and inform new models of care.
A Heteroscedastic Bayesian Generalized Logistic Regression Model with Application to Scaling Problems,2024-01-25 00:00:00,"Jack Sutton, Golnaz Shahtahmassebi, Quentin S. Hanley, Haroldo V. Ribeiro",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17808,"Power law scaling models have been used to understand the complexity of systems as diverse as cities, neurological activity, and rainfall and lightning. In the scaling framework, power laws and standard linear regression methods are widely used to estimate model parameters with assumed normality and fixed variance. Generalized linear models (GLM) can accommodate a wider range of distributions where the chosen distribution must meet the assumptions of the data to prevent model bias. We present a widely applicable Bayesian generalized logistic regression (BGLR) framework to more flexibly model a continuous real response addressing skew and heteroscedasticity. The Generalized Logistic Distribution (GLD) was selected to flexibly model skewed continuous data. This resulted in a nonlinear posterior distribution which may not have an analytical solution which can be solved numerically with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We compared the BGLR model to standard and Bayesian normal models having fixed and varying variance when fitting power laws to 759 days of COVID-19 data. The BGLR yielded information beyond existing methods about the evolution of skew and skedasticity while revealing parameter bias of widely used methods. The BGLR flexibly modelled the complex characteristics necessary for an improved understanding of the propagation and dynamics of this infectious disease. The model is generally applicable and can be used as a template for modeling complexity with other distributions."
Hierarchical Structure of Uncertainty,2024-01-15 00:00:00,Takanori Adachi,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14219,"The experience of unknown events such as financial crises and infectious disease crises has revealed the limitations of measuring risk under a fixed probability measure. In order to solve this problem, the importance of so-called ambiguity, which allows the probability measure itself to change, has long been recognized in the financial world. On the other hand, there have been many studies o n subjective probability measures in the field of economics.But even in those cases, the studies are based on the two levels of uncertainty: risk when a conventional probability measure (probability distribution) is known, and ambiguity due to the fact that the subjective probability measure can be taken arbitrarily in a certain space. In this study, we express n-layer uncertainty, which we call hierarchical uncertainty by introducing a new concepts called uncertainty spaces which is an extended concept of probability spaces and U-sequence that are sequences of uncertainty spaces. We use U-sequence for providing examples that illustrate Ellsberg's paradox. We also investigate categories of U-sequences. Next, we construct an endofunctor S of Mble, the category formed by measurable spaces and measurable functions between them, in order to embed a given U-sequence into it. The endofunctor S maps a measurable space to a set of capacities defined on the space, where a capacity is a non-additive probability measure introduced by Choquet. After developing n-layer uncertainty analysis through U-sequences, we construct the universal uncertainty space as a limit of the sequence of measurable spaces representing multi-layer uncertainty. This universal uncertainty space may be able to serve as a basis for multi-layer uncertainty theory because it has as its projections the uncertainty spaces of all levels. Lastly, we check a sufficient condition for making the functor S be a probability monad."
Transition from time-variant to static networks: timescale separation in NIMFA SIS epidemics,2024-02-14 00:00:00,"Robin Persoons, Mattia Sensi, Bastian Prasse, Piet Van Mieghem",https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12446,"We extend the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA) for the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological process to time-varying networks. Processes on time-varying networks are often analysed under the assumption that the process and network evolution happen on different timescales. This approximation is called timescale separation. We investigate timescale separation between disease spreading and topology updates of the network. We introduce the transition times $\mathrm{\underline{T}}(r)$ and $\mathrm{\overline{T}}(r)$ as the boundaries between the intermediate regime and the annealed (fast changing network) and quenched (static network) regimes, respectively, for a fixed accuracy tolerance $r$. By analysing the convergence of static NIMFA processes, we analytically derive upper and lower bounds for $\mathrm{\overline{T}}(r)$. Our results provide insights/bounds on the time of convergence to the steady state of the static NIMFA SIS process. We show that, under our assumptions, the upper-transition time $\mathrm{\overline{T}}(r)$ is almost entirely determined by the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the network. The value of the upper-transition time $\mathrm{\overline{T}}(r)$ around the epidemic threshold is large, which agrees with the current understanding that some real-world epidemics cannot be approximated with the aforementioned timescale separation."
Parameter estimation for a hidden linear birth and death process with immigration,2024-01-10 00:00:00,"Ibrahim Bouzalmat, Benoîte de Saporta, Solym M. Manou-Abi",https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00531,"In this paper, we use a linear birth and death process with immigration to model infectious disease propagation when contamination stems from both person-to-person contact and contact with the environment. Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the process. The main originality and difficulty comes from the observation scheme. Counts of infected population are hidden. The only data available are periodic cumulated new retired counts. Although very common in epidemiology, this observation scheme is mathematically challenging even for such a standard stochastic process. We first derive an analytic expression of the unknown parameters as functions of well-chosen discrete time transition probabilities. Second, we extend and adapt the standard Baum-Welch algorithm in order to estimate the said discrete time transition probabilities in our hidden data framework. The performance of our estimators is illustrated both on synthetic data and real data of typhoid fever in Mayotte."
A binary search scheme for determining all contaminated specimens,2024-01-30 00:00:00,Vassilis G. Papanicolaou,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11910,"Specimens are collected from $N$ different sources. Each specimen has probability $p$ of being contaminated (e.g., in the case of an infectious disease, $p$ is the prevalence rate), independently of the other specimens. In many cases group testing is applicable, namely one can take small portions from several specimens, mix them together and test the mixture for contamination, so that if the test turns positive, then at least one of the samples in the mixture is contaminated."
