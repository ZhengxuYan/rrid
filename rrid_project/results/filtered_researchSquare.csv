0,10.20944/preprints202403.0992.v1,18 March 2024,Epidemiological Characterization of Dengue Virus Serotypes in Mexico: Implications for Disease Severity,"Porfirio Felipe Hernández Bautista, David Alejandro Cabrera Gaytán, Clara Esperanza Santacruz-Tinoco, Alfonso Vallejos Parás, Julio Elias Alvarado Yaah, Bernardo Martínez-Miguel, Yu Mei Anguiano Hernández, Lumumba Arriaga Nieto, Alejandro Moctezuma Paz, Leticia Jaimes Betancourt, Yadira Pérez Andrade, Oscar Cruz Orozco, Gabriel Valle Alvarado, Mónica Grisel Rivera Mahey","Dengue fever remains a persistent threat in Mexico, with cyclical outbreaks driven by the circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes. The sudden emergence of DENV-3 in 2023 raised questions about its epidemiological significance and potential implications for disease severity. This study aimed to characterize dengue virus serotypes by age and their association with disease severity, considering sex, time, and the origin of clinical samples. A retrospective analysis was conducted on dengue laboratory results obtained from the epidemiological surveillance system in Mexico during 2023. Descriptive statistics summarized the prevalence of dengue virus serotypes, while bivariate analysis utilized an adjusted Chi-squared test to assess associations with demographic variables. Multivariate analysis using unconditional logistic regression evaluated the relationship between dengue virus serotypes and disease severity, adjusting for potential confounders. Additionally, co-infections were identified and analyzed. Results revealed DENV-3 as the most prevalent serotype (63.9%), with co-infection involving two serotypes detected in 0.75% of cases. DENV-2 exhibited a higher median age compared to other serotypes. Pregnant women in their last trimester faced elevated risks of hospitalization and mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated a stronger association between DENV-2 and hospitalization. However, co-infection did not significantly influence disease severity. The unexpected predominance of DENV-3 underscores the dynamic nature of dengue virus circulation in Mexico. Despite its prevalence, DENV-2 demonstrated a stronger association with hospitalization, highlighting the importance of serotype-specific surveillance and management strategies."

It is not uncommon for their patients to get exposed to medical errors. Diagnostic errors, defined as missed, delayed, or wrong diagnosis, are of great importance as they may cause significant harm to the pediatric patient with severe disease. These errors often occur when the symptoms and signs of a disease are atypical or missing. Data on the most frequent misdiagnosed situations in pediatrics is scarce. One of these groups of conditions is that regarding cardiac diseases. The pediatric cardiology field has met rapid development over the past few decades. Primary care providers play a key role in diagnosis, management, and referral of children with heart disease, both congenital and acquired, because many common cardiac complaints are first addressed in the primary care setting. The scope of this review is to investigate the cardiac entities that are often missed by the general pediatricians. In particular, it aims to spot the most common of them, to describe their clinical presentation, their diagnostic options, red flags, and tips, and to provide the ways to avoid erroneous, delayed, or missed diagnosis."

The WHO reports an estimated 58 million people globally living with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with 1.5 million new cases and over 350,000 deaths annually due to HCV-related diseases. Despite the existence of multiple diagnostic methods, the accessibility of diagnosis and treatment is often hindered across the continent by limited resources, insufficient healthcare infrastructure, and low public awareness of Hepatitis C virus Hepatitis C virus infection is a major public health concern in African countries, which have the highest prevalence rates of HCV in the world (1–26%).Egypt, African country which had the highest prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in the world. Its national hepatitis C elimination initiative emerges as an exemplary case of success an having screened over 60 million individuals, and treated more than 4 million, thereby markedly diminishing both the prevalence and incidence of the disease. The strategies employed by Egypt offer critical insights and adaptable frameworks for other African Countries facing analogous challenges.The Aim of this Review is to highlight the triumphs and hurdles of Egypt's approach, while also providing strategic guidance for African Countries to accelerate the journey towards the eradication of hepatitis C."

Even though the precise mechanisms underlying increased synaptic pruning in AD are still unknown, it has been confirmed that dysregulation of the balance between complement activation and inhibition is a crucial driver of pathology. The complement includes three distinct activation mechanisms, with activation products C3a and C5a, potent inflammatory effectors, and a membrane attack complex (MAC), leading to cell lysis. Besides pro-inflammatory cytokines, dysregulated complement proteins released by activated microglia bind to amyloid β at synaptic regions and cause microglia to engulf synapses. Additionally, research indicating that microglia-removed synapses are not always degenerating, and that suppression of synaptic engulfment can repair cognitive deficits point to an essential opportunity for intervention that can prevent the loss of intact synapses. In this study, we focus on the latest research on the role and mechanisms of complement-mediated microglial synaptic pruning at different stages of AD to find the right targets that could interfere with complement dysregulation and be relevant for therapeutic intervention at the early stages of the disease."

Here, we introduce a novel assay format that utilizes label-free bright field images to determine the kinetics of infection-dependent changes in cell morphology. In particular, cell rounding is directly proportional to the amount of infectious virus applied, enabling rapid determination of viral titers in relation to a standard curve. Our kinetic infectious virus titer (KIT) assay is stability-indicating and, due to its sensitive readout method, provides results within 24 hours post-infection. Compared to traditional infectivity assays, which depend on a single readout of an infection endpoint, cumulated analysis of kinetic data by a fit model results in precise results (CV &lt; 20%) based on only three wells per sample. This approach allows for a high throughput with ~400 samples processed by a single operator per week. We demonstrate the applicability of the KIT assay for VSV-GP and NDV, but it can potentially be extended to a wide range of viruses that induce morphological changes upon infection. The versatility of this assay, combined with its independence from specific instruments or software, makes it a promising solution to overcome the analytical bottleneck in infectivity assays within the pharmaceutical industry and as a routine method in academic research."

In the present study, we aim to contribute to the molecular understanding of the development of non-AD and non-FTD dementia by surveying rare pathogenic variants. The analysis was performed on 91 patients, the DNA samples of which were pooled and then subjected to whole exome sequencing. Among detected variants two are rare pathogenic and show significant difference in frequency between the analyzed pool and gnomAD Bulgarian control exomes. The rs373478202, G&gt;T, B9D1 variant, most likely present in heterozygous state; is causative for the autosomal recessive ciliopathy- Joubert syndrome, which involves specific CNS malformation. The rs148918985, C&gt;T, ASS1 variant leads to arginosuccinate enzyme deficiency and in compound heterozygosity with other rare pathogenic variant detected in the same gene causes the late-onset form of citrullinemia type I. This disorder causes high ammonia levels, which can lead to cerebral dysfunction. In conclusion, the detected rare pathogenic variants suggest that, in certain cases, the development of non-AD and non-FTD dementia can be mediated by structural alterations in neuronal cilia or by hyperammoniemia."

A Bioinformatics Approach from the Perspective of the Kruppel-Like Family of Transcription Factors,"Juan Andres Garcia-Loredo, Michelle G. Santoyo-Suarez, Oscar Rodríguez-Nuñez, Diego Francisco Benitez Chao, Elsa N. Garza-Treviño, Patricio Adrián Zapata-Morín, Gerardo R. Padilla-Rivas, Jose Francisco Islas","The CACCC-box motif emerges as a pivotal cis-regulatory element implicated in diverse developmental processes and diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study centers on the intricate interplay between the CACCC-box and its binding proteins such as: the Krüppel-like family (KLF) of transcription factors as primary effectors in the context of CVDs. Our analysis was through a bioinformatics approach, which reveal significant transcriptional activity among KLF subgroup 2, exhibiting the highest number of interactions focusing on the established roles: pluripotency, cancer, and cardiovascular development and diseases. Our analysis reveals KLF's interactions with GATA4, MEF2C, NKX2.5 and other ~ 90 potential genes that participate in the regulation of the hypertrophic environment (or CVD's Environment). Also, the GO analysis showed genes containing the motif CACCC were enriched for multiple CVD’s, in combination with STRING analysis these results pointed to a link between KLFs and these diseases. The analysis further identifies other potential CACCC-box binding factors, such as SP family members, WT1, VEZF1, and -SALL4, which are implicated in cardiac contraction, remodeling, and inflammation processes."

This study aimed to ascertain and investigate the prevalence of this mite in honeybee colonies across 9 provinces in the Republic of Korea (ROK). A total of 615 honeybee colonies were collected, from 66 apiaries during the spring and 58 apiaries during the summer of 2023. A 1,242 bp segment of the the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction method. The detection levels of C. lactis in the honeybees were compared between winter and summer. Based on the COI sequence analysis, the nucleotide sequence similarity of C. lactis mites isolated in the ROK with those from China (NC048990.1) was found to be 99.5%, and with those from the United Kingdom (KY922482.1) was 99.3%. This study is the first report of C. lactis in Korean apiaries. The findings in this study demonstrate a significantly higher detection rate in winter, which is 4.1 times greater than that in summer (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the results underscore the usefulness of molecular diagnostic techniques for detecting C. lactis mites."

We aimed to characterize biomarkers that are useful in discriminating the hospitalization risk in a COVID-19 cohort from Northern Italy during the first pandemic wave.We enrolled and followed for four weeks 76 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and age/sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with mild disease were discharged (n.42), and the remaining were hospitalized (n.34). Blood was collected before any anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy and assessed for soluble C5b-9/C5a, H3-neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), calprotectin, DNase plasma levels by ELISA, and a panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines by ELLA.Calprotectin and NET levels discriminate between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, while DNase negatively correlates with NET levels; there are positive correlations between calprotectin and both NET and neopterin levels. Neopterin levels increase in patients at the beginning of the disease and more in hospitalized than non-hospitalized ones. C5a and sC5b-9, and other acute phase proteins correlate with neopterin, calprotectin, and DNase. Both NET and neopterin levels negatively correlate with platelet count.We show that calprotectin, NET, and neopterin are important proinflammatory parameters potentially useful in discriminating between COVID-19 patients at risk for hospitalization."

The aim of the present study is to investigate the severity of WD in patients in Romania. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted us-ing an online questionnaire consisting of 32 questions in a group of patients suffering from Wilson disease. Results: The study included 67 people aged 7 to 56 with WD. The most common symptoms of the participants were hepatic and neurological in 22 cases (32.8%). The most common neurological symptom in the assessed cases was muscle stiffness (49.5%), followed by tremor (45%), and speech disorders (40.5%). The Kay-ser-Fleischer ring was present in 50.7% of the participants. The most commonly used drug treatment in the participants was D-penicillamine (77.61%). Conclusions: The severity of WD is based on many aspects, the most important being early diagnosis and access to treatment throughout the year. The prognosis is favorable with early diagnosis and treatment, but it is crucial to diagnose individuals before they develop major symp-toms. Therefore, advances in WD screening can lead to an earlier diagnosis and better results."

Non-motor symptoms are well-recognized in PD, and peripheral neuropathy is a frequent but poorly appreciated non-motor sign. Study of how the central and peripheral sensory systems are affected can contribute to the development of targeted therapies and deepen the understanding of the pathophysiology of PD. Although the cause of sporadic PD is unknown, chronic exposure to the pesticide rotenone in humans increases the risk of development of PD. Here, we aimed to investigate whether peripheral neuropathy is present in a traditional model of PD. Mice receiving intrastriatal rotenone showed greatly reduced dopamine terminals in the striatum and reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta and developed progressive motor impairments in hindlimb stepping and rotarod but no change in spontaneous activity. Interestingly, repeated testing using gold-standard protocols showed no change in gut motility, a well-known non-motor symptom of PD. Importantly, we did not observe any change in heat, cold, or touch sensitivity, again based upon repeated testing with well-validated protocols that were statistically well-powered. Therefore, this traditional model fails to replicate PD, and our data again reiterate the importance of the periphery to the disorder that is PD."

The main phyla are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, now renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), an increase in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes abundance promotes its pathogenesis and evolution into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. For this reason, an early treatment is necessary to disfavor its progression. The aim of the present narrative review is to evaluate the different therapeutic approaches to MAFLD. The most important treatment for MAFLD is lifestyle changes. In this regard, the Mediterranean diet could be considered the gold standard in the prevention and treatment of MAFLD. In contrast, a Western diet should be discouraged. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation seem to be valid, safe, and effective alternatives for MAFLD treatment. However, more studies with a longer follow up and with a larger cohort of patients are needed to underline the more effective ap-proaches to contrasting MAFLD."

Systemic manifestations of DD have not been demonstrated so far although a high incidence of neuropsychiatric syndromes suggest an involvement of central nervous system. A Novel ATP2A2 Gene Mutation c.118G>A, causing keratinocyte and cardiomyocyte disconnection in Darier disease, is reported. Their common pathologic pathway, still unreported, was documented by both skin and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy because of cardiac dilatation and dysfunction appeared several decades after skin manifestations.Keratinocyte disconnection was paralleled by cardiomyocyte separation at lateral junction. Cardiomyocyte separation was associated to cell disarray, sarcoplasmic reticulum dilatation and increased myocyte apoptosis. Clinically, hyperkeratotic skin papules were associated to chest pain, severe muscle exhaustion and ventricular arrhythmias that improved following administration of aminophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhancing SERCA2 protein phosphorylation.Specific mutations of ATP2A2 gene may cause cardiac involvement in patients with DD. Cardiac pathologic changes are similar to those documented in the skin including cardiomyocyte disconnection that promotes precordial pain and cardiac arrhythmias. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, enhancing SERCA2 protein phosphorylation may substantially attenuate the symptoms."

The study therefore assessed the clinical manifestations and outcome of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adult patients admitted to Hospital Central Dr. António Agostinho Neto of Lubango, Angola. The study retrospectively reviewed the individual records of patients over 14 years old, admitted for severe malaria during the first trimester of 2021 and 2022. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were used to define severity. A total of 640 patients were recorded into the study, 167 in 2021 and 473 in 2022, distributed across the departments; Intensive Care Unit (ICU; n=81), Medicine (MED; n=458) and Infectiology (INF; n=101). The median age was 26 years and 59.4% were males. The most common manifestation of severe malaria was renal impairment (37.4%). The overall mortality rate was 7% and decreased considerably from 10.2% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2022. The increase in malaria cases during 2022 with increased in prevalence of life-threatening signs like renal impairment, jaundice and impaired conscience, underscores the urgent need for enhanced malaria control and surveillance strategies to mitigate morbidity and mortality, highlighting the potential for antimalarial drug resistance."

Despite the link between hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension may directly affect the cardiac function leading in heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). There are echocardiographic findings indicating hypertensive heart disease (HHD) defined as altered cardiac morphology (left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, left atrium dilatation) and function (systolic or diastolic dysfunction) in patients with persistent hypertension irrespective of cardiac pathologies to which it contributes, such as coronary artery disease and kidney function impairment. In addition to classical echocardiographic parameters, novel indices, like speckle tracking of the left ventricle and left atrium, 3D volume evaluation, myocardial work in echocardiography may provide more accurate and reproducible diagnostic and prognostic data in patients with hypertension. However, their use is still underappreciated. An early detection and prompt therapy of HHD will greatly improve the prognosis. Hence, in the present review, we shed light on the role of echocardiography in the contemporary diagnostic and prognostic approach of HHD."

Due to the instability in feature selection when many potential predictors are measured, a variable selection procedure is proposed that combines several replications of shrinkage regression models. A weighted formulation is used to define the final predictors. The procedure is applied to investigate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) predictors associated to Alzheimer’s disease in the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Two data scenarios are investigated: one considering only the set of SNPs and another with the covariates age, sex, educational level and APOE4 genotype. The SNP rs2075650 and the APOE4 genotype are given as risk factors for AD, which is in line with the literature, and other four new SNPs are pointed, opening new hypotheses for in vivo analyses. These experiments demonstrate the potential of the new method for stable feature selection."

This study aims to explore the role of ccfDNA in the early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of diseases, with a focus on oncology. We conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of current literature, combined with experimental approaches involving advanced genomic sequencing and bioinformatics techniques. Our research systematically characterizes the molecular composition of ccfDNA, including its origins, size distribution, and methylation patterns, across different disease states. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of ccfDNA release and clearance in the bloodstream, elucidating mechanisms that could influence its diagnostic accuracy. In the context of cancer, we analyze the correlation between tumor-derived ccfDNA and disease progression, response to therapy, and overall survival. Our findings indicate that ccfDNA holds promise as a non-invasive biomarker for early disease detection, real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy, and potentially, predicting relapse. This study contributes to the growing field of liquid biopsies and opens new avenues for personalized medicine, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols in ccfDNA analysis to maximize its clinical utility. The implications of our findings extend beyond oncology, suggesting potential applications of ccfDNA in other pathological conditions."

Pediatric patients present with a more extensive form of the disease, especially in the upper GI tract with various histopathological inflammatory patterns. Our study aims to analyze the endoscopic and histopathological findings in children with diagnosed CD and compare results on the initial and follow-up tests. Our study included 100 children and adolescents with CD, with performed endoscopic and histopathological (HP) procedures. The results of multiple biopsies performed in these 8 years were matched and compared. We found a statistically significant decrease in stool changes, weight loss, and abdominal pain as presenting symptoms, and in the fecal calprotectin levels. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileo-colonoscopy 36.59% and 64.86% patients had specific findings, respectively. Non-caseating granulomas were found on 9% of oesophageal, 18% of gas-tric, and 12% of duodenal biopsies. In the lower GI tract, we have observed a disease progression in the rectum and descending colon between the first and second biopsies. Our study showed that more than a third of patients had specific endoscopic (36.59%) and histopathologic (32%) findings in the upper GI tract, and an additional 23% had HP findings highly suggestive of CD. We demonstrated the importance of regular endoscopic and histopathological assessments of pediatric CD patients."

Alonazi, Muhammad Asif Rasheed","Newcastle disease (ND) is a viral infection that affects domestic and wild type birds especially poultry and establishing serious economic costs for poultry industry. Newcastle disease virus’ (NDV) HN membrane receptor is attractive therapeutic candidate, contributes to pathogenicity with various functions such as fusion and prevent viral self-agglutination to permit viral spread. No validated HN inhibitor has been reported yet. However, the purpose of current study was to determine potential compounds via pharmacophore-based screening of natural molecules to inhibit HN receptor of NDV. Physicochemical characteristics and phylogenetic analysis were determined to elucidate structural information and phylogeny of target protein across different species as well as members of gene family. Fill missing residues of HN target protein and evaluated via PROCHECK and VERIFY 3D. We employed shape and feature-based pharmacophore model and screen natural compound’s library through numerous scoring schemes. Top 48 hits with 0.8860 pharmacophore fit score were subjected towards structure-based molecular docking. Top 9 compounds was observed witihin the range of -8.9 to -7.5 kcal/mol binding score. Five best-fitting compounds in complex with HN receptor were subjected to predict biological activity and ADMET analysis. Top two hits were selected for MD simulations to validate binding modes and structural stability. Upon scrutinization, A1 (ZINC05223166) emerges as potential HN inhibitor to treat ND, necessitating further validation via clinical trials."

In this study, we assessed the utility of saliva as a non-invasive medium for measuring V. cholerae-specific serum antibodies in naturally infected individuals. We tested paired serum and saliva samples obtained from a total of 63 cholera patients enrolled in a cohort study. Vibriocidal antibodies assay (IgM/IgG) as markers for accurate determination was used to determine cholera specific antibody levels. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, we found that the best cut-off that maximizes (sensitivity + specificity) is 10 titers. At this saliva titer, the sensitivity is 76.9% (95%CI: 60.9%, 87.7%) and specificity is 80.0% (95%CI: 56.6%, 92.5%). Using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, we also found evidence of a positive correlation between Vibrio Cholerae saliva and serum antibodies (rho=0.66, p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, saliva-based diagnostic cholera tests has high diagnostic accuracy, and would be advantageous, cheaper, and quicker for early diagnosis of severe cholera outcomes."

Recent studies have found an association between eating disorders and IBD, particularly anorexia nervosa and ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). None of these studies report the association with orthorexia nervosa, that is the obsession with healthy and natural foods. Aim: to assess the risk of orthorexia nervosa in patients with IBD. Methods: 158 consecutive subjects were recruited, including 113 patients diagnosed with IBD and 45 controls. The Donini standardized questionnaire ORTO-15 was administered to assess the risk of orthorexia; clinical and demographic data were also collected. Results: patients with IBD have a prevalence of orthorexia of 77%, significantly higher than the 47% observed in the control group. In patients with IBD, the risk of orthorexia is associated with lower BMI and history of previous surgery. Conclusion: Many patients with IBD develop orthorexia nervosa  that impacts the patient's psychological and social sphere, exposes them to a high risk of nutritional deficiencies, and affects  quality of life. Further high quality studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical impact of orthorexia and its correlation with clinical features and frank eating disorders."

M. Braspenning, Sahaya Glingston Rajakani, Adwoa Sey, El Bounja Mariem, Christine Lammens, Youri Glupczynski, Surbhi Malhotra-Kumar","Heteroresistance (HR) to colistin is especially concerning in settings where multi-drug resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae are prevalent and empiric use of colistin might lead to treatment failures. This study aimed to assess the frequency of occurrence of colistin HR (CHR) among (MDR) K. pneumoniae (n=676) isolated from patients hospitalized in 13 intensive care units (ICUs) in 6 European countries in a clinical trial assessing the impact of decolonization strategies. All isolates were whole-genome-sequenced and studied for in vitro colistin susceptibility. Majority were colistin-susceptible (CS) (n=597, MIC 2 µg/ml). 288 CS isolates were randomly selected for population analysis profiling (PAP) to assess CHR prevalence. CHR was detected in 108/288 CS K. pneumoniae. No significant association was found between the occurrence of CHR and country, MIC-value, K-antigen type and O-antigen type. Overall, 92% (618/671) of the K. pneumoniae were MDR with high prevalence among CS (540/592) and CR (98.7%, 78/79) isolates. In contrast, proportion of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CP-Kpn) was higher among CR (72.2%, 57/79) than CS isolates (29.1%, 173/594). Proportions of MDR and CP-Kpn were similar among CHR (MDR: 85%, 91/107; CP-Kpn: 29.9%, 32/107) and CS isolates (MDR: 91%, 539/592; CP-Kpn: 29.1%, 153/59). WGS analysis of PAP isolates showed diverse insertion elements in mgrB or even among technical replicates underscoring the stochasticity of the CHR phenotype. CHR isolates showed high ST diversity (Simpson’s diversity index, SDI: 0.97, in 52 of the 85 STs tested). CR (SDI: 0.85) isolates were highly associated with specific STs (ST101, ST147, ST258/ST512, P ≤ 0.003). The widespread nature of CHR among MDR K. pneumoniae in our study urge the development of rapid HR detection methods to inform on the need for combination regimens."

Despite sharing the same pathogenic variant (PV), Lynch syn-drome variant heterozygotes (LSVH) exhibit considerable phenotypic variability in cancer risk. The role of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) in modifying cancer risk prompted our investiga-tion into whether HLA variations act as genetic modifiers influencing age at cancer diagnosis in a unique cohort of LSVH carrying a PV in the hMLH1 gene in South Africa. Within our extensive LS cohort, 426 individuals carried the same hMLH1 PV (MLH1:c.1528C>T). We selected 100 indi-viduals with the greatest diversity in age at cancer diagnosis and the oldest unaffected individu-als for high-throughput HLA genotyping of 12 HLA class I and II loci using next-generation se-quencing. Statistical analyses employed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with Logrank tests and Cox proportional hazards. Following the robust application of statistical correction methods, six HLA alleles (3.2%) were significantly associated with a young age at cancer diagnosis.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB); however, it has limited protective efficacy in adults. In this study, we constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing Ag85B from M. tuberculosis using a novel attenuated vaccinia virus (KVAC103). We then analyzed the immunogenicity of prime-boost inoculation strategies using recombinant KVAC103 expressing Ag85B (rKVAC85B) compared to BCG. In both the rKVAC85B prime-boost and the BCG prime-rKVAC85B boost inoculation regimens, rKVAC85B induced the generation of specific IgG and the secretion of IFN-γ by immune cells. In vitro analysis of Mycobacterium growth inhibition revealed a comparable immune-mediated pattern of outcomes. Furthermore, bacterial loads in the lungs were significantly lower in mice inoculated with the BCG prime-rKVAC85B boost, than in the BCG-only group following a rechallenge infection with both H37Rv and HN878 strains of M. tuberculosis. These findings collectively suggest that KVAC103, incorporated into a viral vector, is a promising candidate for a novel TB vaccine platform that is effective against multiple TB strains, including H37Rv and HN878, and that rKVAC85B effectively stimulates immune responses against TB infection."

Barbarash","The aim of the study was to examine the long-term prognostic value of changes in cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) within a year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods. Patients with coronary artery disease (n = 251) in whom cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was assessed using the VaSera VS-1000 device before and in a year after CABG. Groups with improved CAVI (CAVI decreased from pathological value to normal or the index remained within normal values) or worsened CAVI (persistent pathological index value or an increase in CAVI to pathological values or an increase of 1 unit or more) were identified. The groups were compared for the following events at 10-year follow-up: death from all causes, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and the combined endpoint. Results. A year after CABG surgery, 45% of patients showed positive dynamics or stable normal CAVI values. Death from all causes was significantly more common in the group with CAVI progression - 32 (27.6%) than in the group with CAVI improvement - 14 (14.8%; p = 0.029). Patients with CAVI progression were more likely to have MACE (death, MI, stroke/TIA) in 49 (42.2%) cases, compared with patients with CAVI improvement - in 23 (24.5%; p=0.008).Negative dynamics of CAVI (p = 0.024), number of shunts (p = 0.006), and the presence of carotid stenosis more than 30% (p = 0.051) were independent predictors of death from all causes at 10-year follow-up after CABG. The presence of carotid stenosis more than 30% (p = 0.002) and the group with negative dynamics of CAVI after a year (p = 0.008) were independent predictors of the development of the combined endpoint during long-term follow-up. Conclusions. Patients with negative dynamics of CAVI one year after CABG were more likely to experience death from all causes and combined endpoint in the long-term follow-up than patients with normal CAVI. In further studies, it is advisable to evaluate the dynamics of CAVI and, based on this, identify the most effective interventions to improve the prognosis of patients after CABG."

WBE addresses limitations of traditional clinical COVID-19 surveillance such as clinical test availability, fluctuating testing rates and increased reliance on rapid antigen tests. Our study in Perth, Western Australia, found a significant positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater and clinical PCR positivity rates (rs = 0.772; p < 0.001) over an 18-month period that included four successive COVID-19 waves. A strong positive correlation was apparent between the proportions of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater and clinical cases within the same region (rs = 0.728; p < 0.001), including earlier detection of Omicron and recombinant lineages in wastewater before clinical case confirmation. The successful integration of WBE with healthcare data underscores its critical role in enhancing public health decision-making and pandemic management. This approach not only demonstrates the value of WBE in current global health surveillance efforts but also highlights the potential of WBE to address future public health challenges, as a comprehensive disease monitoring and response approach."

Psoriatic disease (PsD), encompassing psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and uveitis, presents a significant burden due to its chronic and diverse inflammatory nature, affecting various clinical domains including skin, joints, and internal organs. Psoriasis, affecting up to 3% of the global population, not only poses physical challenges but also profoundly impacts patients' psychological well-being, ranking among the most debilitating chronic conditions. Furthermore, PsD exhibits a spectrum of manifestations ranging from skin lesions like plaque psoriasis to systemic complications such as cardiovascular comorbidities, necessitating comprehensive assessment and management strategies. The increasing understanding of the aetiopathogenic mechanisms of these immune-mediated diseases and of the proinflammatory intracellular signalling pathways involved in Psoriatic disease (PsD) has facilitated the identification and development of new small molecules capable of inhibiting JAK proteins, emerging as effective treatment options for rheumatic and dermatological manifestations JAK inhibitors act rapidly, within a few days, with a striking beneficial class effect on pain. The oral formulation they share makes them a well-tolerated class of drugs, with a clear advantage over FAME in terms of convenience of administration, improving therapeutic compliance.Material and method. This observational, retrospective study conducted in a single-centre dermatology-rheumatology consultation of a second-level hospital in Granada, Spain, focused on patients diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) over the last two years, who initiated treatment with Tofacitinib or Upadacitinib due to DMARD failure, excluding those with major contraindications to JAK inhibitors.Results: This study analyzed data from 32 patients diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), focusing on their demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment history. The majority of patients (75%) initiated treatment with Tofacitinib, while the remainder started with Upadacitinib. The mean age of the patients differed between the two treatment groups. All patients met the CASPAR criteria for PsA diagnosis, with predominantly peripheral joint involvement. The average time from PsA diagnosis to initiation of JAKinhib treatment was 6.5 years, slightly longer for Upadacitinib users. Most patients presented with cutaneous psoriasis, and a minority exhibited radiographic erosions. Before JAKinhib therapy, all patients had previously received DMARDs. A subset of patients received concomitant DMARD therapy, predominantly methotrexate. Additionally, a proportion of patients were on low-dose corticosteroids. Baseline CRP and ESR levels were indicative of systemic inflammation. Disease activity measures at baseline indicated moderate disease activity, with a substantial proportion of patients having mild psoriasis involvement. Upadacitinib recipients with psoriasis primarily exhibited mild involvement. This study provides valuable insights into the characteristics and treatment patterns of PsA patients initiating JAKinhib therapy.Discusion. In this study, the efficacy, safety, and real-world outcomes of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKinhibs) in the treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) were assessed and compared with findings from pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Both Tofacitinib and Upadacitinib demonstrated significant efficacy in PsA patients refractory to DMARDs and TNF inhibitors, with rapid improvement in joint and skin activity indices. Although patients in this cohort exhibited younger age, higher female prevalence, and shorter disease duration compared to those in RCTs, treatment responses were comparable or even superior. Notably, despite fewer concurrent DMARDs and a higher proportion of patients receiving monotherapy, JAKinhibs maintained a favorable safety profile, with a low frequency of mild adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. These findings emphasize the robust efficacy and tolerability of JAKinhibs in real-world clinical settings, supporting their role as effective therapeutic options for PsA patients."

Alzahrani,"This study introduces SkinLiTE, a lightweight supervised contrastive learning model, tailored to enhance the detection and typification of skin lesions in dermoscopic images. The core of SkinLiTE lies in its unique integration of supervised and contrastive learning approaches, which leverages labeled data to learn generalizable representations. This approach is particularly adept at handling the complexities and imbalances inherent in skin lesions datasets. The methodology encompasses a two-phase learning process. In the first phase, SkinLiTE utilizes an encoder network and a projection head to transform and project dermoscopic images into a feature space where contrastive loss is applied, focusing on minimizing intra-class variations while maximizing inter-class differences. The second phase freezes the encoder's weights, leveraging the learned representations for classification through a series of dense and dropout layers. The model was evaluated using three datasets from Skin Cancer ISIC 2019-2020, covering a wide range of skin conditions. SkinLiTE demonstrated superior performance across various metrics—accuracy, AUC , and F1 score—particularly when compared with traditional supervised learning models. Notably, SkinLiTE achieved an accuracy of 0.9087 using AugMix augmentation for binary classification of skin lesions. It also showed comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches of ISIC challenge without relying on external data, underscoring its efficacy and efficiency. The results highlight the potential of SkinLiTE as a significant step forward in the field of dermatological AI, offering a robust, efficient, and accurate tool for skin lesion detection and classification. Its lightweight architecture and ability to handle imbalanced datasets make it particularly suited for integration into Internet of Medical Things environments, paving the way for enhanced remote patient monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. This research contributes to the evolving landscape of AI in healthcare, demonstrating the impact of innovative learning methodologies in medical image analysis."

The specif-ic etiopathogenesis of IBD is not yet fully understood, but a multifactorial interplay of genetic and environmental factors is suspected. A growing body of evidence supports the involve-ment of intestinal dysbiosis in the development of IBD, including the effects of dysbiosis on the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier, modulation of the host immune system, alter-ations in the enteric nervous system, and the perpetuation of chronic inflammation. A com-prehensive understanding of these mechanisms is important to define preventive measures, to develop new effective and lasting treatments and to improve disease outcome. This review examines the complex tri-directional relationship between gut microbiota, mucosal immune system, and intestinal epithelium in IBD. In addition, nonpharmacological and behavioral strategies aimed at restoring a proper microbial-immune relationship will be suggested."

This term covers a broad spectrum of liver lesions, from simple steatosis to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The patho-genesis of ALD is multifactorial and not fully elucidated due to complex mechanisms related to direct ethanol toxicity with subsequent hepatic and systemic inflammation. The accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines promote the development and progression of ALD. To date, there are no targeted therapies to counteract disease progression and prevent acute liver failure. Corticosteroids reduce mortality by acting on the hepatic-systemic inflammation. On the other hand, several studies analyzed the effect of the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines as potential therapeutic targets in ALD.

Aim of the study was a comparison between para-aortic and pelvic oligometastases treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Material/methods: This is a retrospective analysis. De-novo metastatic or extra-nodal disease were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed; pattern of recurrence was evaluated too. A propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to create comparable cohorts. Primary end-point was the progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end-points were biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), ADT-free survival (ADTFS), polymetastases-free survival (PMFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and pattern of relapse.Results: 240 lymph-nodal oligometastases in 164 patients (127 pelvic and 37 para-aortic) were treated. Median PFS was 20 and 11 months in pelvic and para-aortic patients respectively (p=0.042). The difference was not confirmed at the multivariate analysis (p=0.06). Median BRFS was 16 and 9 months respectively in pelvic and para-aortic group (p=0.07). No statistically significant differences for ADTFS or PMFS were detected. The cumulative 5-years LPFS was 90.5%. At PSM no statistically significant differences for all the study end-points were detected. Conclusions: Patients affected by para-aortic disease might have PFS comparable to pelvic disease; local control is high in both cohorts. Our results support the use of SBRT also to para-aortic metastases."

Alterations in calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and glutamate signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of FAD, however it has been difficult to assess in humans whether or not these phenotypes are the result of amyloid or tau pathology. This study aimed to assess early calcium and glutamate phenotypes of FAD by measuring the Ca2+ response of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons bearing PSEN1 mutations to glutamate and the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists NMDA, AMPA and kainate compared to isogenic control and healthy lines. The data shows that in early neurons, even in the absence of amyloid and tau phenotypes, FAD neurons exhibit increased Ca2+ responses to glutamate and AMPA, but not NMDA or kainate. Together this suggests that PSEN1 mutations alter Ca2+ and glutamate signaling as an early phenotype of FAD."

The develop-ment of drugs that target multiple aspects of the disease has emerged as a promising strategy to address the complexities of AD and related conditions. The immune system's role, particularly in AD, has gained considerable interest, with nanobodies representing a new frontier in biomedical research. Advances in targeting antibodies against amyloid-β (Aβ) and using messenger RNA for genetic translation have revolutionized the production of antibodies and drug development, open-ing new possibilities for treatment. Despite these advancements, conventional treatments for AD, such as Cognex, Exelon, Razadyne, and Aricept, often have limited long-term effectiveness, under-scoring the need for innovative solutions. This necessity has led to the incorporating of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning into the drug discovery process for neurodegenerative diseases.

In present study, two groups of experimental CRs loaded with different contents of fluoride-doped nano-zirconia fillers (25 wt% and 50 wt%) were fabricated. The surface topography, mechanical performance, fluoride release, antibacterial effect, aging property and cytotoxicity of the experimental CRs were evaluated subsequently. A uniform distribution of the F-zirconia fillers over the whole surface of resin matrix could be observed. The experimental CRs showed continuous fluoride release within 28 days, which was positively correlated with the content of F-zirconia fillers. Moreover, the amount of fluoride release increased in the acidic buffer. Addition of F-zirconia fillers could improve the color stability, wear resistance and microhardness of the experimental CRs, without reducing the flexure strength. Furtherly, the fluoride ions released continuously from the experimental CRs resulted in effective contact and antibacterial properties, while they showed no cytotoxicity. As a consequence, considerations can be made to employ this new kind of composite resin loaded with fluoride-doped nano-zirconia fillers to meet clinical requirements when the antimicrobial benefits are desired."

Median ejection fraction was 51 (43-54 %) and more than two thirds of the patients presented valvular calcifications. Overall mortality was 22%. Interleukin 1-Beta correlated positively with ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain and negatively with left atrium diameter and left ventricle tele systolic diameter. Galectin 3 values negatively correlated with aortic valve fibrosis and mitral valve calcifications and human suppression tumorigenity factor 2 negatively correlated with mitral valve calcifications. Some of these novel biomarkers could be used to better asses the cardio-vascular disease in patients on maintenance hemodialysis."

When social mitigation was relaxed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, re-emergence of HFMD was observed in Gwangju, South Korea, and seasonal characteristics of the disease appeared to have changed. To investigate the molecular characteristics of enterovirus (EV) associated with HFMD during 2022, 277 specimens were collected. Children aged under 5 years accounted for the majority of affected individuals. EV detection and genotyping were performed using real-time RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR followed by sequence analysis. EV detection rate was found to be 82.3%, and the main genotype identified was CV-A6. Sixteen CV-A6 samples were selected for whole genome sequencing. According to phylogenetic analysis, all CV-A6 strains from this study belonged to the sub-genotype D3 clade based on VP1 sequences. Analysis of 3D polymerase phylogeny showed that only the recombinant RF-A group was identified. In conclusion, circulating EV types should be continuously monitored to understand pathogen emergence and evolution during the post-pandemic era."

Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs), a unique class of SiO2NPs, have been widely accepted as a desired pesticide carrier. However, their role in enhancing the disease resistance and the specific mechanism remain unknown. In this study, three sizes of HMSNs (19, 96 and 406 nm as HMSNs–19, HMSNs–96 and HMSNs–406, respectively) were synthesized and characterized to determine their effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseolus (FOP) suppression in cowpea roots by foliar spray using phenotypes, fresh biomass and disease progression as indicators. The results revealed that three HMSNs exhibited no adverse impacts on seed germination and tended to improve plant growth. Also, they exert their FOP suppression with a size- and concentration-dependent manner. HMSNs–406 possessed the best control effect at a concentration of 1000 mg/L showing an upto 40.00% decline in the disease severity. The Si(OH)4 control was also effective on FOP suppression at a lower concentration of 100 mg/L, whereas its higher concentrations exhibited obviously adverse impacts on FOP control, seed germination and plant growth. Moreover, we conformed that HMSNs posed their Fusarium wilt suppression in cowpea plant by activating SA (salicylic acid)-dependent SAR (systemic acquired resistance) responses rather than directly suppressing FOP. A higher level of SA content and elevated expression of its maker genes of PR-1 and PR-5 in HMSNs–406 treated cowpea roots provided substantial evidences of this mode of action. Other resistance-related genes, as well as defense-responsive enzymes, were also involved in the HMSNs-activated SAR pathway. Overall, for the first time, our results extended a new role of HMSNs as a potent elicitor to serve as a versatile alternative for plant disease protection of low cost, highly efficiency and sustainability."

The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of MRI, both in standard position and with joint hyperextension, “stress test” (ST), in the study of the plantar plate (PP) disease that involves metatarsophalangeal joints. Material and methods: 25 patients were recruited into our study over a two-year period, 15 positive for metatarsal pain and 10 controls. All symptomatic patients were evaluated before treatment (surgery). Hence, the imaging features were reflective of the natural and true state of the lesions. Results:25 patients were recruited into our study over a two-year period, 15 positive for metatarsal pain and 10 controls. In symptomatic patients: 11/15 demonstrated plantar plate tear/dysfunction on both standard position and stress test, 2/15 had plantar plate tear on stress test (tear not showed on standard position), and 2/12 had no plantar plate tear on both standard position and stress test. The latter two patients showed dorsal subluxation on stress test due to micro-instability for plantar plate failure.In asymptomatic patients, 9/10 were negative for plantar plate dysfunction, and 1/10 was positive for plantar plate dysfunction (dorsal subluxation demonstrated only on stress test), without plantar plate tear.Conclusion:Standard MRI reported, in asymptomatic patients, a specificity of 100% and high NPV (90%), incremented by the ST (NPV and specificity 100%).In symptomatic patients, PP evaluation on standard MRI reported sensitivity of 80%, while stress test increased sensitivity to 100%; in the evaluation of dorsal subluxation of the metatarsophalangeal joint, the sensitivity was 60% (standard MRI) but reached 100% with ST.""Stress test"" is an easy task to perform and even affordable in terms of time-consuming (requiring only one additional T2-weighted MRI sequence) for both patients and operators."

It progresses from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fibrosis is often present during NAFLD progression; however, factors determining which subjects develop NASH or fibrosis are unclear. Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) is a family of secreted proteins involved in senescence and scarring mainly synthetized in the liver. Here we aimed to study the association of IGFBP and its induced senescence with the progression of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods: 16 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 23 ± 3 g were fed either Methionine-Choline Deficient or control diet for 2, 8 or 12 weeks. Blood and liver samples were collected; histological assessment of NAFLD and fibrosis was performed. Fat contents were measured. Cellular senescence was evaluated in the liver. IGFBP levels were assessed in liver and serum. Data was expressed as Mean ± SD and analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed Tukey’s test. Lineal regression models were applied for NAFLD and fibrosis progression. p"

Niu","Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cattle raised in North America. At the feedlot, cattle are subject to metaphylactic treatment with macrolides to prevent BRD, a practice that may promote antimicrobial resistance and has resulted in an urgent need for novel strategies. Mannheimia haemolytica is one of the major bacterial agents of BRD. The inhibitory effects of two amphipathic, α-helical (PRW4, WRL3) and one β-sheet (WK2) antimicrobial peptides were evaluated against multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. haemolytica isolated from Alberta feedlots. WK2 was not cytotoxic against bovine turbinate (BT) cells by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. All three peptides inhibited M. haemolytica, with WK2, being the most efficacious against multiple isolates. At 8-16 µg/ml, WK2 was bactericidal against Mh 330 in broth and at 32 µg/ml in the presence of BT cells, reduced the population by 3 logs CFU/ml without causing cytotoxic effects. The membrane integrity of Mh 330 was examined using NPN (1-N-phenylnaphthylamine), and ONPG (o-Nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside) with both the inner and outer membranes being compromised. Thus, WK2 may be a viable alternative to the use of macrolides as part of BRD prevention and treatment strategies."

Santos,"Secondary movement disorders (SMDs) represent a heterogeneous group of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal, involuntary movements resulting from various underlying causes. This comprehensive review aims to thoroughly understand SMDs, including their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach, and management strategies. SMDs encompass a spectrum of movement abnormalities, including dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tics, and tremors. They can arise from a multitude of etiologies, such as drug-induced effects, post-infectious processes, metabolic disturbances, and structural brain lesions. The epidemiology of SMDs varies depending on the underlying cause, with some conditions being more prevalent in specific populations or age groups. Understanding the pathophysiology of SMDs is crucial for accurate diagnosis and targeted management. Diagnosing SMDs requires a comprehensive approach, including a detailed history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, neuroimaging studies, and sometimes electrophysiological studies. Management of SMDs is multifaceted and may involve pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical interventions. Individualized treatment plans are essential, considering the underlying cause, severity of symptoms, and patient preferences. Emerging concepts in the field of SMDs include advancements in genetic research, identification of biomarkers, and development of novel therapeutic approaches. There is a growing focus on patient-centered care and improving the quality of life for individuals with SMDs. In conclusion, SMDs pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for optimal management. Continued research and collaboration are essential for advancing our understanding and treatment of these complex disorders."

The treatment of a/cGVHD consists of steroid administration at full dose. In the case of aGVHD, around 60 % of patients with grade III/IV fails to respond (steroid-resistant, SR), requiring a second line therapy. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) represents a good option for second line treatment, leading to multiorgan response in several patients. Here, we have evaluated the performances of a cytofluorimetric quality control of the first ECP procedure in 29 patients with severe SR aGVHD who underwent ECP. The quality control represents a check control of in vitro cell apoptosis/death induction in collected and irradiated CD3+ cells by ECP. Our analysis shows that in more than 70 % quality controls a relevant apoptotosis/death of CD3+ cells was observed after  cell irradiation, as compared to non-irradiated controls. Albeit observed in a small patients’ series, the occurrence of relevant in vitro effect after ECP relates to less procedures and/or to a better survival on ECP. Age, disease, gender, aGVHD grade and time from transplant to the first ECP had not impact on ECP efficacy in this patients’ series."

However, the expansion of high-density fish populations also brings forth a challenge – the rapid transmission and spread of infectious disease agents among them. To combat this, vaccination is emerging as a reliable and standardized method for providing immunity against viral and bacterial outbreaks. The ideal vaccine is expected to be safe, effective, economical, and easily administered. The fish vaccination industry continually publishes new information on fish immunology and vaccinology, contributing to the improvement of vaccine formulation and efficacy. This review aims to offer insights into the current status of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases, discuss existing vaccinations, and address potential industry-threatening diseases like infectious edwardsiellosis, motile aeromonas septicemia, TiLV, salmon anemia, vibriosis, and white spot disease. Technological advancements have played a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of fish immunological mechanisms, leading to improved vaccine administration and the development of recombinant live attenuated, subunit, DNA, and RNA vaccines. However, challenges such as oral tolerance, vaccine degradation, and stressful environments persist, impacting vaccine efficacy. Addressing these challenges and gaining a deeper understanding of the fish immune system and host-pathogen interactions will be pivotal for future improvements, contributing to the sustainability of aquaculture and enhancing global food security."

Its importance as a cause of morbidity and an impediment to economic development in some of the poorest countries in the world motivated the international community to implement several programs to control or eliminate this scourge.  Initially, these involved reducing transmission of the causative agent Onchocerca volvulus through controlling the vector population.  When ivermectin was found to be a very effective drug for treating onchocerciasis, the strategy shifted to mass drug administration (MDA) of endemic communities.  In some countries, both vector control and ivermectin MDA have been used together.  However, traditional vector control methods involve treating rivers in which the black fly vectors breed with insecticides, a process which is expensive, requires trained personnel to administer, and is ecologically harmful.  In this review, we discuss recent research into alternatives to riverine insecticide treatment, which are inexpensive, ecologically less harmful and which can be implemented by the affected communities themselves.  These can dramatically reduce vector densities and, when combined with ivermectin MDA, can accelerate the time to elimination when compared to MDA alone."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein inhibits type-I interferon (IFN) signaling, promoting HBV escape from the innate immune system to establish persistent infection. However, whether X proteins of Orthohepadnavirus viruses in the other species have similar inhibitory activity remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anti-IFN activity of 17 Orthohepadnavirus X proteins derived from various hosts. We observed conserved activity of Orthohepadnavirus X proteins in inhibiting TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-mediated IFN-β signaling pathway through TRIF degradation. X proteins from domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), a novel member of Orthohepadnavirus, inhibited mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated IFNβ signaling pathway comparable with HBV X. These results indicate that inhibition of IFN signaling is conserved in Orthohepadnavirus X proteins."

Recent data highlight similarities between neurodegenerative diseases including PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) suggesting a crucial interplay between the gut–brain axis. GLP-1R agonists, known for their use in T2DM treatment, are currently extensively studied as novel PD modifying agents. For this narrative review article, we searched PubMed and Scopus databases for peer-reviewed research, review articles and clinical trials regarding GLP-1R agonists and PD, published in the English language with no time restrictions. We also screened the references of the selected articles for possible additional articles in order to include most of the key recent evidence. Our research was conducted between February 2023 and February 2024. We used the terms “GLP-1”, “GLP-1 receptor”, “GLP-1R agonists”, “PD”, “T2DM”, “insulin”, “neurodegenerative disease”, “glucose”, “animal models”, “clinical trials” in different combinations. Many data on animal models and preclinical studies show that GLP1-R agonists can restore dopamine levels, inhibit dopaminergic loss, attenuate neuronal degeneration and alleviate motor and non-motor features of PD. Evidence from clinical studies are also very promising enhancing the possibility of adding GLP1-R agonists in the current armamentarium of drugs available for PD treatment."

The S. aureus' ability to colonise the upper respiratory tract and other tissues, such as the skin, throat and gut, operate as reservoirs for infection. Indeed, being a carrier of S. aureus in the gut represents a risk factor for developing infection in distinct sites, including an unusual gastrointestinal tract disease. Here, we present an atypical clinical course of staphylococcal enterocolitis (SEC) in a man in his early seventies. After an unforeseen identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the oral administration of vancomycin was critical in the outcome of the case. Although infrequent, SEC is an underestimated disease and requires a chapter in the treatment recommendations for antibiotic-related diarrhoea. Awareness of the risk factors and diagnostic tests, along with including SEC in algorithms for handling antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, is a step towards new epidemiological information."

(2) 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was applied to the ocular surface for 14 days to induce corneal injury in male Balb/c mice. During the BAC treatment period, HY7302 (1 × 108 CFU/kg/day or 1 × 109 CFU/kg/day) or omega-3 positive control (200 mg/kg/day) were administered orally (n = 8/group). To examine signaling pathways affected by HY7302 treatment, the in vitro effects of HY7302 on tight junctions and the inflammatory response were investigated in a mouse colon epithelial cell line, CMT-93. (3) BAC exposure decreased tear production, induced ocular inflammation and corneal epithelial detachment, and altered gut microbiota. However, oral administration of HY7302 restored tear secretion and decreased corneal epithelial detachment in BAC-treated corneal injury mice. Further, HY7302 alleviated corneal inflammation via modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and alterations in gut microbiota composition. (4) These findings suggest that the gut–eye axis interaction between gut microbiota and eye tissue affects disease severity in corneal injury, and that alteration of the microbiota by HY7302 could improve eye health by regulating the inflammatory response."

Reantaso, Charles R Tyler, Channarong Rodkhum","Small scale carp polyculture plays a key role for food supply in Bangladesh, however, factors including water pollution, limited infrastructure and inadequate disease management hinder its sustainability. This paper reports on a survey of 231 farmers across the 6 major carp producing regions in Bangladesh, analyzing factors including, farmers’ social aspects, farm characteristics, information on disease and approaches adopted to combat them, and biosecurity practices. Almost half (46.8%) of the farms surveyed experienced disease in carp species, with clear regional variations. Eighty four percent of farms reported carp mortalities during disease outbreak, with an average mortality level 10.23±11.81%. Clinical signs during outbreaks lasted between a week and a month, and there was a peak in disease outbreaks in two seasonal periods between June to July and October to December. Disease incidence was related to a range of factors including the farmer experience, ponds/farm type, stocked species, and biosecurity practice. A combination of disinfecting measures during pond preparation and measures during stocking, including discarding fingerling transport water off-farm, fingerling disinfection and check the health of fingerlings before stocking significantly reduced disease occurrence. Treatments involving the antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and azithromycin were reported as   ineffective, raising concerns about non-prudent use, inadequate dosing (perhaps without appropriate veterinary guidance) and the potential for further driving antimicrobial resistance in the environment. The research unveils a concerning pattern of disease high disease incidence across small-scale carp farms in Bangladesh and the significant potential for disease spread highlights the need for responsible disposal practices. The study emphasizes the need for improving training and awareness programs are vital for addressing biosecurity and disease management challenges, ensuring sustainable aquaculture and community well-being."

It is the only oral drug approved for the treatment of Leishmaniasis and American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas Disease). Although its precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood, miltefosine exhibits broad-spectrum anti-parasitic effects primarily by disrupting the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis of the parasites while sparing the human hosts. In addition to its inhibitory effects on phosphatidylcholine synthesis and cytochrome c oxidase, miltefosine has been found to affect the unique giant mitochondria and the acidocalcisomes of parasites. Both of these crucial organelles are involved in Ca2+ regulation. Furthermore, miltefosine has the ability to activate a specific parasite Ca2+ channel that responds to sphingosine, that is different to its L-type VGCC human ortholog. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of recent advancements of the anti-parasitic mechanisms of miltefosine. We also explored its multiple molecular targets and investigated how its pleiotropic effects translate into a rational therapeutic approach for patients afflicted by Leishmaniasis and American Trypanosomiasis. Notably, miltefosine's therapeutic effect extends beyond its impact on the parasite to also affect positively the host's immune system. These findings enhance our understanding on its multi targeted mechanism of action. Overall, this review sheds light on the intricate molecular actions of miltefosine highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic option against these debilitating parasitic diseases."

While the influence of genetic variability in the pathogenesis of hypertension is well described internationally, limited reports are available for African populations. This study aimed to assess the association of genetic variants and essential hypertension in a cohort of two ethnic South African population groups. Two hundred and seventy-seven hypertensive and one hundred and seventy-six normotensive individuals were genotyped for 79 variants. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate Assay and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. The association of variants was assessed using the Fisher Exact test under the additive and allelic genetic models, while multivariate logistic regression was used to predict the development of hypertension. Five variants (CYP11B2 rs179998, AGT rs5051 and rs699, AGTR1 rs5186 and ACE rs4646994) were significantly associated with essential hypertension in the cohort under study. Furthermore, AGTR1 rs5186 and AGT rs699 were identified as risk factors for the development of hypertension in both ethnic groups. In two ethnic South African populations an association was observed between Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) related genes and the development of hypertension."

The virus has a high mortality rate and can spread rapidly between infected individuals. Vaccination against RHDV2 provides the best protection against disease and should be considered by all rabbit owners. Here, we investigate the duration of immunity provided by vaccination with the Medgene Platform conditionally licensed commercial vaccine 6 months following the initial series. Rabbits received either the vaccination or a placebo and were challenged with RHDV2 6 months later. All vaccinated rabbits survived challenge whereas 18/19 non-vaccinated controls succumbed to infection within 10 or fewer days post-challenge. These results demonstrate lasting immunity following vaccination with the Medgene RHDV2 vaccine."

It is considered as a potential paradontopathogen. This microorganism is also reported in the respiratory tract. We aimed to analyze the available literature about the prevalence of Trichomonas tenax in the population affected by periodontal disease. Materials and Methods: Тhe searching with keywords: ,,Trichomonas tenax” and “periodontal diseases’’ in Scopus, PubMed and ScienceDirect databases was able to identify several systematic reviews and original articles until July 2023. All studies with suffering from periodontal disease people, mentioned year of publication, country, specified detection methods, total number of tested samples as well as the percentage of those infected with Trichomonas tenax were included. Irrelevant articles were excluded. Results: We found 137 studies, but only 64 studies about distribution of Trichomonas tenax in patients with gum disease underwent qualitative analysis. The highest number of studies have been conducted in Iran, Poland and Iraq. Different methods have been used to detect the unicellular organism, each with different specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: Interest in Trichomonas tenax has grown considerably since 2000. Because of its association with periodontal disease, Trichomonas tenax role in the inflammatory process shouldn’t be overlooked."

However, not only blood vessels are responsible for the tumor cells' spread. During the process of tumor growth, lymphangiogenesis is mediated by other isoforms of the VEGF family, specifically VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are independent of the bevacizumab action. Therefore, based on the mechanism of bevacizumab action and the processes of angio- and lymphangiogenesis, we formed three hypotheses: 1) if the lymph nodes in the primary ovarian cancers are metastatic, the outcome of bevacizumab treatment is worsened; 2) concerning the second-line treatment, bevacizumab will act in a weakened manner if the recurrence occurs in lymph nodes compared to local recurrences; 3) patients treated by bevacizumab are more likely to have recurrences in lymph nodes. These hypotheses raise the issue of the existing gap of knowledge, which concerns the effect of bevacizumab on the metastatic lymph nodes."

Baseline data from 30 pre-HD and 85 HD patients were analyzed, in-cluding iPTH, vitamin D, FGF-23, fetuin-A, sclerostin and VC scores (Adragao method). Preva-lence of VC was similar in both groups, but HD patients had more frequent VC scores ≥6. Pre-HD patients were older, with higher prevalence of hypertension and less frequent use of calcium phosphate binders. Both groups showed similar patterns of hyperphosphatemia, low vitamin D, and iPTH. Fetuin-A levels were higher in pre-HD, while FGF-23 was elevated in HD patients. Higher VC risk in pre-HD patients was associated with male gender, older age, lower fetuin-A and higher sclerostin, lower ferritin and no vitamin D treatment, while in HD patients with higher sclerostin, FGF23 and urea, and lower iPTH. Conclusion. Progression of CKD from the pre-HD to the HD stage is accompanied by a decreased effect of the inhibitor and an increase in the promoter VC. However, mineral imbalance, hormonal regulation, treatment options, and patient-specific fac-tors should be considered. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathways."

Still, only 27- 46% of patients respond to initial therapy with ICI’s and of those, up to 65% develop resistance within four years. After disease progression (PD), treatment options are limited, with 10% Objective Response Rate (ORR) to second or third-line chemotherapy. In this context, ICI rechallenge is an appealing option for NSCLC. Most data on the efficacy of ICI rechallenge are based on retrospective real-world studies of small, heavily pretreated, and heterogeneous patient groups. Despite these limitations, these studies suggest that ICI monotherapy rechallenge in unselected NSCLC patient populations who discontinued initial ICI due to PD is generally ineffective, with a median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of 1.6-3.1 months and a Disease Control Rate (DCR) of 21.4%-41.6%. However, there is a subpopulation that benefits from this strategy, and further characterization of this subgroup is essential. Furthermore, immunotherapy rechallenge in patients who discontinued initial immunotherapy following treatment protocol completion and progressed after an immunotherapy-free interval showed promising efficacy, with a DCR of 75-81%, according to post-hoc analyses of several clinical trials. Future research of ICI rechallenge for NSCLC should focus on better patient stratification, to reflect the underlying biology of immunotherapy resistance more accurately."

Corn kernel powder is used as a carrier for Tetramycin biopesticide, with various compounds tested for bonding.They were then made by extrusion moulding.Temperature and wetness responsive components, including Pentaerythritol Tetrastearate, Pentaerythritol Tetraoleate, Polyethylene Glycol Stearate, and Polyethylene Glycol Monooleate,are compounded and coated onto Tetramycin cores to form an intermediate shell layer. Finally, Ethyl cellulose(EC)and Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose(HPMC) are dissolved and sprayed onto the outermost layer to complete the pellet's shell layer.After the evaluation of texture performance test,DSC analysis,TG test,temperature and humidity response performance test, as well as pellet cross-section SEM observation, field effectiveness test, etc., the preferred formulations were screened.The results showed that the preferred Core formulation:Corn kernel powder:Tetramycin aqueous:Xanthan gum mass ratio=13.5:23:2; Intermediate Shell layer:PETS: PETO: PEG400MO mass ratio=10:30:10; and Outer Shell layer: Ethyl cellulose (EC):Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) mass ratio=5:1.Under soil conditions of high incidence of Ralstonia solanacearum, i.e., sustained warmth (30-35℃) and high humidity (30% moisture content), the formulated pills showed a release rate of 95.18% to 96.24% over a period of 35 days. Moreover, they showed a stepwise cyclic release process under alternating warm and humid-dry and cold conditions.In field tests on tobacco, a relative preventive efficacy of 54.74% was achieved 106 days post-transplanting. Soil bacterial community structure analysis revealed a significant decrease (2.28-2.84 times) in the abundance of Solanaceae Raelia under Tetramycin pellet treatment compared to the control. Additionally, fungal community structure showed highter consistency initially across various soil depths, with diversity differences between soil layers reestablished later (106 days), while the predominant categories of bacteria and fungi remained unchanged.In this study, we successfully developed a nucleoshell-type slow-controlled release pill embedded with Tetramycin. This pill effectively responded to temperature and humidity changes, resulting in high efficacy in disease prevention.This development holds significant promise for effectively improving drug utilization and easing application challenges, offering broad prospects for Ralstonia solanacearum prevention and control in agriculture."

The aims of this study were to analyze all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE- cardiovascular death, non-fatal reinfarction and stroke and target vessel revascularization) during eight-year follow-up in STEMI patients with premature CAD.Method: we analyzed 2,560 STEMI patients without previous CAD and without cardiogenic shock at admission who were treated with primary PCI. CAD was classified as premature in men aged <50 years and women <55 years.Results: Of the 2,560 patients analyzed 630(24.6%) patients had premature CAD. Patients with premature CAD have fewer comorbidities and better initial angiographic findings, as compared to patients without premature CAD. The incidence of non-fatal adverse ischemic events was similar to the incidence in older patients. Premature CAD was an independent predictor for lower mortality (HR 0.50, 95%CI 0.28-0.91) and MACE (HR 0.27, 95%CI 0.15-0.47). In patients with premature CAD, EF<40% was the only independent predictor of mortality (HR 5.59 95%CI 2.18-8.52) and MACE (HR 4.18, 95%CI 1.98-8.13).Conclusion: Premature CAD was an independent predictor for lower mortality and MACE.

However, the epidemiology and factors associated with MDR Escherichia coli on Ugandan farms are not well known. This study investigated the prevalence, resistance patterns and factors associated with MDR E. coli carriage on chicken farms. A total of 158 E. coli strains were isolated from 158 chicken farms. The disc diffusion method for susceptibility testing was performed. Clinical breakpoints were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. MDR was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. MDR E. coli prevalence on chicken farms was 62.7% (95% CI: 55.0 – 70.3). High resistance was observed against ampicillin 79.8% (95% CI: 72.7–85.4), tetracycline 72.8% (95% CI: 65.2–79.2), cotrimoxazole 55.7% (95% CI: 47.8–63.3), and ciprofloxacin 38% (95% CI: 30.7–45.9). Farmers who were males (APR = 0.72, CI: 0.55, 0.93), and attained at least secondary education (APR=0.64, CI: 0.46, 0.88) and administration of recommended antibiotic doses (APR = 0.76, CI: 0.59–0.96) posed a lower risk of MDR E. coli carriage. Farms without footbaths posed a heighten risk (APR=1.48, CI: 1.16–1.88). MDR E. coli were highly prevalent on chicken farms. This study underscores the need for antimicrobial stewardship and improved infection prevention strategies on chicken farms."

There are now no effective control techniques available except for fungicide sprays, which may directly impact consumers. Biological control is becoming an alternative method for the control of plant diseases to replace or decrease the application of traditional synthetic chemical fungicides. Trichoderma is widely used as a biological agent for controlling strawberry root rot. In order to provide resources for screening the highly effective biocontrol fungus for controlling strawberry root rot caused by Neopestalotiopsis clavispora, the biocontrol mechanism,the control effects of Trichoderma asperellum CMT10 against strawberry root rot and growth-promoting effects on strawberry seedlings were investigated by plate culture, microscopy observation and root drenching methods.The results showed that CMT10 had obvious competitive, antibiotic and hyperparasitism effects on Neopestalotiopsis clavispora CMGF3. The CMT10 could quickly occupy nutritional space, and the inhibition rates of CMT10 against CMGF3 in confrontation culture on 7 d was 65.49%. The inhibition rates of volatile metabolite and fermentation metabolite produced by CMT10 against CMGF3 were 79.67% and 69.84%, respectively. The mycelium of strain CMT10 can act as hyperparasites by making contacting, winding and penetrating hyphae of CMGF3. Pot experiment showed that the biocontrol efficacy of CMT10 on strawberry root rot caused by Neopestalotiopsis clavispora was 63.00%. CMT10 had obvious promotion effect on strawberry growth, the plant height, root length, total fresh weight, root fresh weight, stem fresh weight and root dry weight, with the promotion rates were 20.09%, 22.39%, 87.11%, 101.58%, 79.82% and 72.33%, respectively. Overall, this study showed the ability of Trichoderma asperellum CMT10 to control strawberry root rot and their potential to develop as novel biocontrol agents to replace chemical fungicides for eco-friendly, sustainable agriculture."

Our goal was to identify gene variants associated with these glaucoma types by assessing the mutational burden in 76 matrix metalloproteinase-related genes. We studied 101 childhood glaucoma patients with no identified monogenic alterations using next-generation sequencing. Gene expression was assessed through immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis of selected gene variants was conducted in cultured cells and in zebrafish. Patients presented a higher proportion of rare variants in four metalloproteinase-related genes, including CPAMD8 and ADAMTSL4, compared to controls. ADAMTSL4 protein expression was observed in the anterior segment of both the adult human and zebrafish larvae's eye, including tissues associated with glaucoma. In HEK-293T cells, expression of four ADAMTSL4 variants identified in this study showed that two variants (p.Arg774Trp and p.Arg98Trp) accumulated intracellularly, inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Additionally, overexpressing these ADAMTSL4 variants in zebrafish embryos confirmed partial loss-of-function effects for p.Ser719Leu and p.Arg1083His. Double heterozygous functional suppression of adamtsl4 and cpamd8 zebrafish orthologs resulted in reduced volume of both the anterior eye chamber and lens within the chamber, supporting a genetic interaction between these genes. Our findings suggest that accumulation of partial functional defects in matrix metalloproteinases-related genes may contribute to increased susceptibility to early-onset glaucoma and provide further evidence supporting the notion of a complex genetic inheritance pattern underlying the disease."

Abdel Rahman","Cholinesterase (ChE) and secretase (BACE) inhibitors, and fibril- and β-amyloid-suppressing medicines are used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptomatically. The prevalence and complex nature of AD have increased the urgent need for multi-targeted directed ligands (MTDLs). This is because MTDLs can prevent potential drug-drug interactions during poly-therapy and have a better therapeutic profile than single targeted agents.  Using piperazine linker or spacer and two primary scaffolds, benzofuran and 8-hydroxyquinoline, a unique class of multi-targeted medicines was recently reported by our group. These compounds showed re-markable effectiveness in inhibiting Aβ1-42 aggregation and acting as iron chelators.The results prompted us to synthesize an additional series of compounds as multimodal anti-AD agents and investigate its inhibitor activities to ChE (AChE/BChE) and BACE1 enzymes. The resulting in-hibitory effects suggested that the compounds under study might be used to improve cognitive function. The docking analysis' findings revealed that the compounds bind to AChE and BChE by forming H-bond interactions with amino acid residues at binding sites and µ-stacking inter-actions with aromatic residues, whereas the binding to BACE1 only revealed H-bond interac-tions with amino acid residues at binding sites."

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were used to diagnose glycemic control and peripheral arterial disease, respectively. A generalized Poisson log-linear regression model was used to calculate the crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, and a significance level of p < 0.05. 226 patients were included in the study, finding 23% (n=52) with good glycemic control, and 44.7% (n=101) with peripheral arterial disease. The adjusted model found statistically significant associations for glycemic control, age, and sedentary lifestyle with peripheral arterial disease. Compared with patients with good glycemic control, those with poor glycemic control had a 34% higher probability of presenting peripheral arterial disease (aPR: 1.34, 95%CI: 1.01-1.79, p=0.045). The prevalence of good glycemic control in the population with diabetic foot is low. Poor glycemic control was found to be independently associated with the presence of peripheral arterial disease."

The intestinal absorption rate determines the body burden of Cd because humans lack a physiologic mechanism for excretion of the metal. Most acquired Cd accumulates in the kidneys, in which the Cd content increases through age 50 but falls thereafter. The decline from maximal kidney content is probably due to release of Cd from injured tubular cells into urine and replacement of destroyed nephrons by scar tissue. Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, or when albuminuria is present. Albuminuria is defined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine in women or ≥ 20 mg/g creatinine in men that persists for at least 3 months. Generally, Cd-induced reductions in eGFR are not reversible, and Cd nephropathy may progress to end-stage kidney disease. There is no evidence that elimination of current environmental exposure can reverse Cd nephropathy, and no theoretical reason to believe that such a reversal is possible. This review provides an update of knowledge concerning CKD in population environmentally exposed to Cd. Special attention is devoted to mechanisms of Cd-induced albuminuria concurrently with eGFR reductions, and the difficult challenge of exposure guidelines sufficient to eliminate the risk of Cd-induced CKD is addressed."

This study aims to compare the caregivers' burden, including the impact on mental and physical health, social support, and quality of life, in different neurodegenerative disorders. Methods:Fifty-five primary caregivers (F=41;mean age=53.07±12.29) of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD=26), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA=16), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS=13), took part in the study. Standardized screening scales for the quality of life (EQ-5D/EQ-VAS and PQoL), levels of the caregiving burden (CBI and FSQ), and the assessment of the anxiety-depressive axis (HADS) were administered.

To counteract this, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed, targeting EGFR activity. However, the emergence of metastases and resistance mutations often undermines the durability of the treatment response. Knowledge-based mechanistic models that replicate existing clinical trial outcomes, tailored to specific population characteristics, provide invaluable assistance in designing future clinical trials. These models are particularly effective in identifying optimal responders to specific treatments, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. We have developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for gefitinib and osimertinib, representing two distinct generations of EGFR TKIs, to accurately simulate the drugs’ distribution within the primary tumor and metastatic sites following oral administration. These models were integrated with a pathophysiological mechanistic model of EGFR-mutant LUAD, enabling the representation of the effects of both gefitinib and osimertinib on EGFR activation-induced signaling pathways. This comprehensive model outputs detailed evolutions of the primary tumor and each metastatic site, facilitating the evaluation of patient progression in alignment with RECIST guidelines (version 1.1). Notably, the model encapsulates the heterogeneity within the tumor, through the representation of various subclones, each characterized by unique mutation profiles, thereby reflecting differential responses to treatment. Calibration of the model was achieved using publicly available data from the NEJ002 and FLAURA clinical trials. Rigorous visual predictive checks and statistical tests were employed to ensure the proper behavior of the model. The model adeptly replicated the time to progression observed in real clinical trials in EGFR-mutant LUAD patients receiving gefitinib or osimertinib as first-line therapy. In addition, the model was able to reproduce the results from a retrospective study comparing gefitinib and osimertinib, a study that was not used to inform the model. With a consistent virtual population as a reference, the combined model facilitated a comparative analysis of the efficacy of both treatments, thereby underscoring its utility in evaluating therapeutic strategies. The faithful replication of real-world data significantly enhances the credibility of our model, rendering it a vital investigational tool for deriving pertinent insights and informing treatment strategies, particularly in identifying optimal responders to various generations of EGFR TKIs. Following its consecutive prospective validations in the FLAURA2 and MARIPOSA trials, the model is poised to facilitate the generation of synthetic control arms in future clinical trials. This advancement promises a more nuanced analysis of covariate relationships, especially when comparing investigational treatments to established standards of care. Additionally, it potentially reduces the required patient cohort size in such trials, optimizing resource utilization."

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the uremic phenotype of CKD contributing to elevated cardiovascular and overall mortality in affected individuals. This study aimed to explore novel metabolic pathways in non-dialysis dependent stage 5 CKD patients using semitargeted metabolomics. In a prospective observational design involving 50 patients, blood samples collected before the initial hemodialysis session underwent liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometer analysis. Univariate (Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate (logistic regression with LASSO regularization) methods identified metabolomic variables associated with inflammation. Notably, adenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (APS), dimethylglycine, pyruvate, lactate, and 2-ketobutyric acid exhibited significant differences in the presence of inflammation. Cholic acid, homogentisic acid, and 2-phenylpropionic acid displayed opposing patterns. Multivariate analysis indicated increased inflammation risk with certain metabolites (N-Butyrylglycine, dimethylglycine, 2-Oxoisopentanoic acid, and pyruvate), while others (homogentisic acid, 2-Phenylpropionic acid, and 2-Methylglutaric acid) suggested decreased probability. These findings unveil potential inflammation-associated biomarkers related to defective mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation and branched-chain amino acid breakdown in CKD, shedding light on cellular energy production and offering insights for further clinical validation."

While vaccines have been useful in  staying the cholera outbreaks, the ideal window for re-vaccinating individual’s resident in cholera hotspot  areas remains unclear. Using a prospective cohort study design, 225 individuals were enrolled, re-vaccinated  with two doses of Shanchol™ regardless of previous vaccination and followed-up for 90 days. Bloods collected  at baseline before re-vaccination, at day 14 prior to second dosing and subsequently on days 28, 60, and 90.  Vibriocidal assay was performed on samples collected at all five time points. Our results showed that anti-LPS  and vibriocidal antibody titers increased at day 14 after re-vaccination and decreased gradually at 28, 60 and  90 across all the groups. Seroconversion rates were generally comparable in all treatment arms. We therefore  conclude that vibriocidal antibody titers generated in response to re-vaccination still wane quickly irrespective  of previous vaccination status. However, despite the observed decline, the levels of vibriocidal antibodies  remained elevated over baseline values across all groups, an important aspect for Zambia where there is no  empirical evidence as to the ideal time for re-vaccination."

This study utilized confocal imaging to investigate heparan sulfate (HS) within the cerebrovasculature and its potential associations with CAA, gender, and ApoE4 genotype. Our investigation revealed elevated levels of HS in the cerebrovasculature of AD patients with severe CAA. Additionally, these patients exhibited higher colocalization of HS with Aβ in the cerebrovasculature, including both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell compartments. Intriguingly, a reversal in the polarized expression of HS within the cerebral vasculature was detected in AD patients with severe CAA, suggesting a potential role in CAA development. Furthermore, male patients exhibited lower levels of both parenchymal and cerebrovascular HS. Additionally, ApoE4 carriers displayed heightened cerebrovascular Aβ expression and a tendency of elevated cerebrovascular HS levels in AD patients with severe CAA. Overall, these findings shed light on the intricate interplay between HS, Aβ, ApoE, and vascular pathology in AD, underscoring the potential roles of cerebrovascular HS in CAA development and AD pathology. Further exploring the underlying mechanisms may present novel therapeutic avenues for AD treatment."

BNT162b2 and CoronaVac are among the top most widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Much less is known on the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain based vaccines in the pediatric population compared to adults. Given the worldwide need for booster vaccinations to stimulate the immune response against new Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, we characterized the humoral and cellular immune response against Omicron variant BA.1 in a pediatric population aged 10 to 16 years who received heterologous vaccination based on two doses CoronaVac, two doses CoronaVac (2x) plus one booster doses BNT162b2 [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (1x)], two doses CoronaVac plus two booster doses BNT162b2 [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (2x)], and three doses BNT162b2. We observed that [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (2x)] vaccination showed higher anti-S1 and neutralizing antibody titers and CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity specific to the Omicron variant compared to immunization with two doses CoronaVac alone. Furthermore, from all groups tested, immunity against Omicron was highest in individuals who received three doses BNT162b2. We conclude that booster vaccination with BNT162b2 promotes greater immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population compared to two doses CoronaVac alone."

IgAN causes end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 20–40% of all cases. The activation of the complement system by pathological circulating IgAs, which is often associated with low serum C3 levels (LowC3), seems to play a crucial role. Previous studies have shown an association between histological evidence of TMA, which is the result of alternative complement activation, and poor outcome. However, it is not known to what extent the decrease in serum C3 levels reflects ongoing TMA injury. Our study aimed at assessing the association of LowC3 and ESKD and whether this association reflects ongoing TMA. We enrolled all patients with biopsy-proven IgAN and followed-up patients until last visit, ESKD or death. Of the 56 patients included in the study, 12 (21%) presented low serum C3 (LowC3) at the time of renal biopsy. TMA was significantly more frequent in the LowC3 group [7/12 (58%) vs 9/44 (20%), p=0.02]. After adjusting for potential confounders, LowC3 was strongly associated with an increased hazard of ESKD (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.84 [95%CI: 1.69,20.15; P=0.005). The association was not affected by adjusting for TMA. The estimated overall proportion of the relation between C3 and ESKD mediated by TMA was low and not statistically significant. Our study provides evidence that C3 hypocomplementemia is associated with an increased risk of ESKD with mechanisms that are largely independent from TMA."

Specifically, several viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Zika virus (ZIKV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), along with several others mentioned, include the various viruses presently considered within the field. We delve into the strong evidence implicating these viruses in the development of AD. We will also extend beyond these mere associations by carefully analyzing the potential mechanisms by which viruses may contribute to AD pathology. This includes but is not limited to direct neuronal infections, dysregulation of immune responses, and the impact on protein processing. Controversies and challenges of the viral-AD relationship emerge as we tease out these potential mechanisms considered. Looking forward, we emphasize the future directions the field should take to tackle the remaining unanswered questions and the glaring research gaps that persist. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the past, present, and future of the potential link between viral infections and their association with AD development."

EVs, composed of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, are taken up by cells to affect a variety of signaling cascades. Research in the field has primarily focused on stem-cell derived EVs, with a particular focus on mesenchymal stem cells, for their potential therapeutic benefits. Recently, tissue specific EVs or cell type specific extracellular vesicles (CTS-EVs), have garnered attention for their unique biogenesis and molecular composition because they enable highly targeted cell-specific communication. Various studies have outlined the roles that CTS-EVs play in signaling for physiological function and maintenance of homeostasis, including immune modulation, tissue regeneration, and organ development. These properties are also exploited for disease propagation, such as in cancer, neurological disorders, infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions, and more. The insights gained from analyzing CTS-EVs in different biological roles not only enhance our understanding of intercellular signaling and disease pathogenesis, but also open new avenues for innovative diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a wide spectrum of medical conditions. This review comprehensively outlines current understanding of CTS-EV origins, function within normal physiology, and implications in diseased states."

Lerner, J. Kimble Frazer, Blair Apple, April Vaughan, Marvin Payton, Stavros Stavrakis, Evgeny V. Sidorov, Kar-Ming A. Fung, Dharambir K. Sanghera","MFGE8 is a major exosome (EV) protein known to mediate inflammation and atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in animal studies. However, its role in the pathophysiology of human T2DM, obesity, and cardiovascular disease has been controversial and less explored. Earlier, we reported a rare Asian Indian population-specific missense variant (rs371227978; Arg148His) in the MFGE8 associated with increased circulating Mfge8 and T2DM. Here, we have further investigated the role of Mfge8 with T2DM risk in additional Asian Indians (n=4917) and Europeans and other multiethnic cohorts from UK Biobank (UKBB) (n= 455,808) and the US (n=1150). We also evaluated the exposure of Mfge8-enriched human EVs (with and without mutation) in zebrafish (ZF) for their impact on the cardiometabolic organ system.Most individual carriers of Arg148His variant not only had high circulating Mfge8 but also showed a positive significant correlation with glucose (r= 0.42; p = 4.9x10-04), while the non-carriers showed a negative correlation of Mfge8 with glucose (r = -0.38; p = 0.001) in Asian Indians. However, the same variant was monomorphic in Europeans and other ethnic groups of UKBB and US cohorts. Even in the absence of Arg148His variant, serum Mfge8 correlated significantly with blood glucose both in Caucasians (r = 0.56; p = 8.4x10-10) and individuals from other ethnicities (African Americans, Hispanics, and others) (r = 0.31; p = 5.8x10-4). Since Mfge8 is an EV marker, the exposure of Mfge8-enriched human EVs to ZF larvae rapidly developed fatty liver disease and heart hypertrophy and exhibited redundant growth with poor muscular architecture with and without the high-fat diet (HFD), while the control group fishes developed fatty liver disease and heart hypertrophy only after the HFD feeding. With strong evidence from animal studies supporting the role of Mfge8 in obesity, insulin resistance, and the development of atherosclerosis in T2DM, the current research suggests that circulating Mfge8 may be a potential marker for preventing or reducing the risk of T2DM and cardiovascular disease."

Classic compartmental models (CM) employed to describe epidemic spreading often fail to capture the intricacies of real disease dynamics. Rooted in the mean-field assumption, CM models oversimplify by assuming that every individual has the potential to ""infect"" any other, neglecting the inherent complexity of underlying network structures. Given that social interactions follow a networked pattern with specific links between individuals based on social behaviors, the amalgamation of classic CM and network science in epidemiology becomes essential for a more authentic portrayal of epidemic spreading. This review delves into noteworthy research studies that, from various perspectives, elucidate how the synergy between networks and CM can enhance the accuracy of epidemic descriptions. In conclusion, we explore research prospects aimed at further elevating the integration of networks within the realm of epidemiology, recognizing its pivotal role in refining our understanding of disease dynamics."

They constitute the most numerous categories of biological forms populating our biosphere and are highly diverse and capable of infecting almost all bacteria. Phages make use of their host cell molecular machinery to express their own genes as they lack the ability to independently reproduce themselves. The inimitable characteristics of bacteriophages have enabled them to become propitious tools in biotechnology and genetic engineering. Phages show no tropism for mammalian cells but however, can be easily modified to present targeting ligands on their surface as coat protein fusions without any negative impacts on phage structure. These displayed ligands thereupon guide the recognition, interaction, and internalization of the phage into cells wherein efficiency of transfection is directly influenced by the copy number of the ligands used for targeting. Engineered phages are more efficacious for transgene delivery and gene expression in cancer cells when compared to other non-viral gene transfer strategies and are therefore being employed in developing cancer vaccines. The high level of stability as well as resistance of bacteriophages to various environmental conditions have enabled the development of virus-like particles (VLPs) capable of successful deliverance of several therapeutic drug cargos into tumors by selective targeting. Phage display technology has been used in therapy of Alzheimer’s disease and drug delivery into the brain. Exogenous peptides fused into the coat protein of phages enables the display of these peptides on the phage surface to generate combinatorial phage that facilitates their rapid separation using their ability to bind to a specific molecular target. Phage therapy has been shown to be safe in clinical settings when compared to antibiotics as it shows no adverse anaphylaxis nor adverse effects such as the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria.  This review provides intriguing details of the use of natural and engineered phages in the therapy of diseases such as cancer, bacterial infections, bovine mastitis and dementia in addition to the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in generating genetically engineered phages. Further, the use of phage display technology in generating monoclonal antibodies against various human diseases is elucidated."

A Study Using the Wireless Motility Capsule (WMC),"Orestes Cobos-Quevedo, Gildardo Alfonso Hernandez, Xaira Jimena Rivera-Gutiérrez, Peter Grube-Pagola, Jose Maria Remes-Troche","Background: This study explores the impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on regional gastrointestinal (GI) transit times in individuals with celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NGCS). While a GFD is established for managing CD and wheat allergy, its effects on NGCS remain controversial due to inconclusive evidence. Methods: Utilizing a wireless motility and pH capsule (WMC) to assess regional and whole gut transit, newly diagnosed CD (n=12) and NGCS (n=12) patients underwent baseline evaluations, including measurements of gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit times. Results: At baseline conditions, individuals diagnosed with CD exhibited prolonged colonic and intestinal transit times when compared to those with NGCS (p&lt;0.05). Following a 4-week GFD, CD patients experienced significant reductions in both intestinal and colonic transit times, along with enhanced small intestine contractility. NGCS individuals showed improvements in intestinal transit time and contractility with a GFD, although the colon exhibited no discernible effect. The GFD did not significantly impact intragastric, intestinal, or colonic pH. Conclusions: This study, employing WMC for the first time, provides novel insights into the positive effects of a GFD on intestinal and colonic transit, as well as contractility, in CD patients, and to a lesser extent, in those with NGCS."

Studies indicate that initial biofilm formation plays a crucial regulatory role in these infections, as well as in colonising and maintaining the gastrointestinal tract as a commensal member of the microbiome of most land animals. It has long been thought that vegetation of endocarditis resulting from bacterial attachment to the endocardial endothelium requires some pre-existing tissue damage, and in animal models of experimental endocarditis, mechanical valve damage is typically induced by cardiac catheterisation preceding infection. This section reviews historical and contemporary animal model studies that demonstrate E. faecalis ability to colonise the undamaged endovascular endothelial surface directly and produce robust microcolony biofilms encapsulated within a bacterially derived extracellular matrix. This report reviews both previous and current animal model studies demonstrating the resilient capacity of E. faecalis to colonise the undamaged endovascular endothelial surface directly and produce robust microcolony biofilms encapsulated in a bacterially derived extracellular matrix. The article also considers the morphological similarities when these biofilms develop on different host sites, for example when E. faecalis colonises the gastrointestinal epithelium as a commensal member of the common vertebrate microbiome, lurking in plain sight and transmitting systemic infection. These phenotypes may enable the organism to survive as an unrecognised infection in asymptomatic subjects, providing an infectious resource for subsequent clinical process of endocarditis."

LSD is endemic in Africa and Middle East but in recent years has spread in different Asian countries. Drop of animal productions, vaccination campaign, surveillance costs and trade restrictions have significant impact on the economy of affected countries. The disease is well characterized in cattle while little is known in buffaloes and no experimental studies have been conducted in this species. Six buffaloes and two cattle were inoculated with an Albanian LSD virus (LSDV) field strain. Over a period of 42 days animals were clinically monitored and sampled for serological and virological analysis. Only two buffaloes showed clinical sign, fever, skin nodules and lymphadenitis. All samples tested in real time PCR (blood, swabs, biopsies and organ) gave negative results. Three buffaloes seroconverted at day 39 and 42 post-inoculation, detected by ELISA, but all sera were negative in serum neutralization test. Cattle showed more severe clinical signs. Moreover, viraemia and virus shedding were proven by positive PCR results and antibodies were detected by both ELISA and serum neutralization test. These findings demonstrated the limited susceptibility of buffaloes compared to cattle once experimental infected with LSDV. Further studies are needed to investigate the epidemiological role of the buffaloes."

The transcription factor Nrf2 is a master regulator of oxidative stress. Here we reported that the FDA-approved, oral agent simvastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, significantly activates the expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes. Simvastatin also induces fetal hemoglobin expression in SCD patient erythroid progenitors and a transgenic mouse model. Simvastatin alleviates SCD symptoms by decreasing hemoglobin S sickling, oxidative stress, and inflammation stress in erythroblasts. Particularly, simvastatin increases cellular levels of cystine, the precursor for the biosynthesis of antioxidant reduced glutathione and decreases the iron content in SCD mouse spleen and liver tissues. Mechanistic studies suggest that simvastatin suppresses the expression of critical histone methyltransferase, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 to reduce both global and gene-specific histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. These chromatin structural changes promote the assembly of transcription complexes to fetal γ-globin and antioxidant genes regulatory regions, in an antioxidative response element-dependent manner. In summary, our findings suggest that simvastatin activates fetal hemoglobin and antioxidant protein expression and modulates iron and cystine/reduced glutathione levels to improve the phenotype of SCD and represents a therapeutic strategy for further development."

Separation surgery, the current standard surgical treatment, does not fully address spinal deformity. Advances in operative management warrant reevaluating maximal tumor resection and anterior column reconstruction with corpectomy.Methods: An IRB-approved retrospective single-center review of 63 patients was performed. Demographics, tumor characteristics, clinical and radiographic data, treatments, and neurological and survival outcomes were analyzed.Results: The mean age at presentation was 63.5 ± 9.6 years (range, 37-84 years) and 28 patients (44.4%) were female. Functional outcomes, measured by KPS, RAND-36 survey scores and Oswestry Disability Index all improved postoperatively (pre- vs postop: 70 to 80 (p=0.0056), 26.5 to 46.4 (p=0.0081), and 28.9 to 16.9 (p=0.0613), respectively). Spinal alignment also improved, with Cobb angle measurements showing a reduction in spinal kyphosis from -5 to 0 (p=0.021). Nine patients (14.5%) had non-fatal postoperative complications. The median OS for this cohort was 14.4 months (range, 0.6-145.0 months) with median follow-up time of 15.5 months.Conclusion: In oligometastatic spinal disease patients with good functional status, corpectomy for decompression of neural elements, deformity correction, and spinal stabilization is associated with improvements in pain and functional outcomes without overwhelming morbidity."

We have used PubMed to identify randomized controlled trials [RCTs] published between 1st June 2010 and 30th June 2023, in patients from birth to 18 years old, with gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], who received treatment with any PPI. The literature yielded 76 articles and 13 met inclusion criteria. For infants, PPIs were equal to placebo in reducing GERD symptoms in 4 articles. In 1, the number of GER episodes and esophageal acid exposure were lower in infants who received PPIs and left lateral position, but there was no significant improvement in symptoms. In another publication, the combination of PPIs and feeding modifications [FM] was not more effective than PPIs alone. For children and adolescents, PPIs were effective in improving symptoms and achieving mucosal and histological healing, which was subsequently maintained. To conclude, PPIs are not effective to reduce symptoms related to GERD in infants, but are effective in older children, along with histological remission. Generally, PPIs are well tolerated, but it is important to not forget the possible adverse events [AE], especially if they are used for a long time."

Dysregulated glycosylation is linked to a spectrum of diseases, encompassing cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital disorders, infections, and inflammation. This review delves into the intricate interplay between glycosylation and protein conformation, with a specific focus on the profound impact of N-glycans on the selection of distinct protein conformations, characterized by distinct interactomes – namely protein assemblies - under normal and pathological conditions across various diseases. We begin by examining the spike protein of the SARS virus, illustrating how N-glycans regulate the infectivity of pathogenic agents. Subsequently, we utilize the prion protein and the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 as examples, exploring instances where N-glycosylation transforms physiological protein structures into disease-associated forms. Unraveling these connections provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic avenues and a deeper comprehension of the molecular intricacies that underlie disease conditions. This exploration of glycosylation's influence on protein conformation effectively bridges the gap between the glycome and disease, offering a comprehensive perspective on the therapeutic implications of targeting conformational mutants and their pathologic assemblies in various diseases. The goal is to unravel the nuances of these post-translational modifications, shedding light on how they contribute to the intricate interplay between protein conformation, assembly and disease."

Telemedicine acts to maintain connectivity between patients and healthcare professionals. This review aimed to assess telemedicine helps to monitoring in NAFLD.  The database was searched from The PubMedCentral and ScienceDirect from 2020 to 2023. We assessed the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) for randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-RCTs systematic reviews. Meta-analyses with random-effects model to determine the pooled mean difference (MD) and p-value. There were three RCT and two non-RCT were included (n=239) with 56.9% males and the mean age was 51.3 years. Median intervention lasted 5.5 months. The parameter were body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, liver function (AST/ALT), lipid profile and HbA1c. Metaanalysis showed telemedicine had a significant effect on improving outcomes for BW (MD -2.81: 95% CI, -4.11, -1.51, P 0.0001) and BMI (MD -1.01: 95% CI, -1.47, -0.55, P 0.0001) compared to standard care, while the AST/ALT were not significantly reduced. Other laboratory parameter were decreased from systematic reviews. Telemedicine through mobile-based applications could be an option for monitoring body weight and BMI in NAFLD patients facing the pandemic."

This function is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes. However, recent studies have revealed non-canonical functions of GCN1 that are independent of GCN2, such as its participation in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the immune response, beyond the borders of species. Although it is known that GCN1 and GCN2 interact with ribosomes to accomplish amino acid starvation sensing, recent studies have reported that GCN1 binds to disomes (i.e. ribosomes that collide each other), thereby regulating both the co-translational quality control and stress response. We propose that GCN1 regulates ribosome-mediated signaling by dynamically changing its partners among RWD domain-possessing proteins via unknown mechanisms. We recently demonstrated that GCN1 is essential for cell proliferation and whole-body energy regulation in mice. However, the manner in which ribosome-initiated signaling via GCN1 is related to various physiological functions warrants clarification. GCN1-mediated mechanisms and its interaction with other quality control and stress response signals should be important for proteostasis during aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and may be targeted for drug development."

Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling processes in the aortic wall are hypothesized to be involved in the development of the disorders. Therefore, in a histological study, we investigated the expression of metalloproteases 1 and 9 (MMP1 and MMP9) and their inhibitors (TIMP 1 and TIMP 2) in cardiac surgery patients. In parallel, we studied the aortic roots by echocardiography. Clinical reports of 111 patients (30 women and 81 men) who suffered from aortic aneurysms and an aortic dissection were evaluated and studied by transesophageal echocardiography. Seven patients, who had coronary heart disease served as „healthy controls“ All patients were surgically operated in the period from 2007 to 2015.  A tissue sample of the aortic biopsies was collected from each patient during surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for MMP1, MMP9 and TIMP1, TIMP2 as well. Vascularization was monitored by an CD 31 antibody. In direct comparison, the expressions are not homogeneous. We found smallest changes in the intima area at all.  An increase in MMP 1 and MMP 9 expression was detected in both media and adventitia in case of dissections. TIMP 1 and TIMP 2 distribution increases from the lumen of the vessel outward in the wall layers of the aorta. In case of arteriosclerotic changes, intima had a capillarization, but not in the media. Opposite pattern was found in the dissected aortas. Whereas the intima appears empty, vascularization was found in the media and adventitia layers, as well. There are differences in the vascularization between between the aneurysm and dissection and the different layers as well, respectively. A different remodeling process of the ECM in comparison of the vascular layers must be hypothesized. Reading the patterns of staining and with regard to the known inhibitory effect of MMP9 on ECM remodeling, but especially TIMP 2 on neoangiogenesis, a disturbed nutrition and a dysfunctional vasa vasorum remodeling must be assumed as cause of dissection."
