Alex  Brown Artem V.  Gelis Mrinal K.  Bera Binhua  Lin Wei Bu Mark L. Schlossman,"ions at liquid surfaces and interfaces influence many scientific and technological areas, including molecular and nanoparticle assembly for energy and separations processes. controlled transport of ions between interfacial and bulk liquids can lead to triggering ion-induced interfacial phenomena. here, we show that x-ray exposure alters the competitive equilibrium of rare earth elements bound to chelating ligands in bulk water and to insoluble monolayers at the water surface. controlling the x-ray exposure leads to reversible adsorption of rare earth trivalent ions to the liquid surface. evidence for the exposure-induced temporal variations in the ion surface density is provided by synchrotron x-ray fluorescence near total reflection (xfntr) measurements. varying the x-ray penetration depth from 10 nm to 2.8 µm leads to a controlled exposure of either the surface region alone or the surface monolayer plus dissolved chelating ligands and bulk water. this separation of surface and bulk processes helped identify the role of aqueous radiolysis in the adsorption cycle. comparison of different chelates identified amine binding sites as a contributor to the cycling mechanism. the primary molecules utilized for these studies – chelating ligand dtpa and organophosphoric acid extractant dhdp – are like those used in the separation of rare earth elements from ores and in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. the observed reversible cycling of ion adsorption may provide an opportunity for further control over these processes and enhanced separation."

Moreno Valerie A. Schoepfer Matthew B.J. Lindsay," interfacial processes involving metal (oxyhydr)oxide phases often control the mobility and bioavailability of nutrient and contaminant elements in soils, sediments, and water. consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of earth over geologic time.  here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy, to derive accurate surface complexation model constants for ferrihydrite-water systems containing aqueous \ce{moo_4^{2-}}. this is achieved by employing a force-field that is adept at capturing  the realistic dynamics of surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption processes or proton transfer events. we inform surface complexation models by exploring the free energy landscape of \ce{moo_4^{2-}} adsorption at the ferrihydrite-water interface at different concentrations. we find how hydration and adsorption induce changes in surface charge, prompting the surface to restructure into more disordered ferrihydrite phases. we observe how the dynamics of adsorbed complexes are concentration-dependent and how surface restructuration, along with adsorption, influence the interfacial hydrogen bond network. by incorporating reactivity, reactive molecular dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions."

Alexandrova,"dynamic restructuring of cu electrode has been observed under electrochemical conditions, and it has been hypothesized to underly the unique reactivity of cu towards co2 electroreduction. surface roughening is one of the key surface phenomena to cu activation, in which the surface forms numerous atomic vacancies and adatoms. however, the atomic structure of such surface motifs, in the presence of relevant adsorbates has remained elusive. here, we explore the chemical space of cu surface restructuring under coverage of co and h in realistic electroreduction conditions, by a combination of grand canonical density functional theory and global optimization techniques, from which we construct a potential-dependent grand canonical ensemble representation of the surface. significant vertical displacement of  surface cu atoms is observed in the regime of intermediate and mixed co and h coverage. this regime, while predicted to be thermodynamically inaccessible, is kinetically controlled, presenting a tough challenge for theory. to investigate the kinetic trapping effects, we develop a quasi-kinetic monte carlo simulation to track the evolution of the system during a simulated cathodic scan. the simulation reveals the path that the system takes across the coverage space and the metastable structures that the system evolves into along the way. chemical bonding analysis is performed on the metastable structures with elevated cu*co species to understand its formation mechanism. by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, the surface chemistry of the cu*co species is explored, and we identifies potential mechanisms via which the cu*co species may diffuse or dimerize. this work provides rich atomistic insights into the surface roughening phenomenon and the structure of the involved species. it also features generalizable methods to explore the chemical space of restructuring surfaces with mixed adsorbates, and its evolution in non-equilibrium."

Martin Bollinger Jr.,"hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (h6h) is an fe(ii)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (fe/2og) oxygenase that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of scopolamine, a prolifically administered anti-nausea drug. after its namesake first reaction, h6h couples the newly installed c6-bonded oxygen to c7 to form the epoxide of scopolamine. oxoiron(iv) (ferryl) intermediates initiate both reactions by cleaving c–h bonds, but it remains unclear how the enzyme switches target site and promotes (c6)o–c7 coupling in preference to c7 hydroxylation in the second step. in one possible epoxidation mechanism, the c6 oxygen would – analogously to mechanisms proposed for the fe/2og halogenases and, in a parallel study, n-acetylnorloline synthase (lolo) – coordinate as alkoxide to the c7–h-cleaving ferryl intermediate to enable alkoxyl coupling to the ensuing c7 radical. here we provide structural and kinetic evidence that h6h instead exploits the distinct spatial dependencies of competitive c–h-cleavage (c6 vs c7) and c–o-coupling (oxygen rebound vs cyclization) steps to promote the two-step sequence without substrate coordination or repositioning for the epoxidation step. structural comparisons of ferryl-mimicking vanadyl complexes of wild-type h6h and a variant that preferentially 7-hydroxylates instead of epoxidizing 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine suggest that only a modest (~ 10°) shift in the fe–o–h(c7) approach angle is sufficient to change the outcome. the observation that, in wild-type h6h, ²h₂o solvent also increases the c7-hydroxylation:epoxidation ratio by ~ 8-fold implies that the latter outcome requires cleavage of the alcohol o-h bond, which, unlike in the lolo oxacyclization, is not accomplished in advance of c–h cleavage."

Mace,"fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid with an alarmingly low lethal dosage of 2 mg. the equipment necessary to detect fentanyl in field settings (e.g., handheld spectrometers) is restricted to highly trained, well-funded, and specialized personnel. established point-of-need technologies, such as lateral flow immunochromatographic strips, are available; however, they often involve multiple contact-based steps (e.g., collection, mixing) that pose a higher risk to users handling unknown substances. herein, we developed a colorimetric displacement assay capable of contactless detection of fentanyl as liquid or solid samples. the basis of our assay relies on the presence of fentanyl to displace a redox mediator, ferrocene carboxylic acid, inclusively bound in the cavity of a supramolecular host, cb[7]. the displacement is only possible in the presence of high affinity binding guests, like fentanyl (ka  ~ 106 m-1). the liberated redox guest can then react with indicator reagents that are free in solution, producing either: (i) a distinct blue color to indicate the presence of fentanyl or (ii) remain a pale blue tint in the absence of fentanyl. we demonstrate rapid and specific detection of fentanyl free base and fentanyl derivatives (e.g., acetyl fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl) against a panel of 9 other common drugs of abuse (e.g., morphine, cocaine, heroin). furthermore, we highlight the intended use of this assay by testing grains of fentanyl derivatives on a surface with a drop (i.e., 25 µl) of assay reagent. we anticipate this approach can be applied broadly to identify the presence of fentanyl at the point of need."

Kurusu  Nathalie Tufenkji," due to growing concerns of plastic pollution release into water bodies, it is imperative to understand and assess the removal of nanoplastics and microplastics during wastewater treatment processes. although earlier studies have shown high removal of plastic contaminants during coagulation, flocculation and settling, a limited number of experiments have examined the removal of nanoplastics in relevant water chemistries including higher ph values and in the presence of organics. in this study, the removal of nanoplastics and microfibers is assessed using conventional (alum) and alternative coagulants including aluminum chlorohydrate (ach) and cationic polyamines (pdadmac) in a synthetic wastewater matrix for ph conditions between 7 and 8.6. our results show that plastic removal is considerably reduced at higher ph values when alum is used as a coagulant. at the shorter settling time of 30 s, removal of pristine and aged nanoplastics declined from 64 ± 3% and 76 ± 3% respectively (ph 7) to less than 20% at ph values higher than 7.8.  similarly, polyester microfiber removal was observed to decline from 97 ± 1% at ph 7 to 85 ± 3% at ph 8.6 for samples collected after 3 min of settling. replacing alum with polynuclear aluminum coagulants resulted in greater plastic contaminant removal at ph values above 8 with a maximum observed microfiber removal of 95 ± 1% (ach; ph 8.6; 3 min settling time) and a maximum observed nanoplastic removal of 71 ± 5% (ach+pdadmac; ph 8.2; 30 s settling time). quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (qcm-d) measurements revealed that ach coagulant species results in a thicker deposition layer on negatively charged surfaces compared to alum. the addition of pdadmac to ach led to a more favorable interaction with a model negatively charged surface, indicated by a faster and more rigid deposition of the alternative coagulant. taken together, these results show that environmental conditions, including water ph and interactions with wastewater colloids, affect plastic contaminant removal during primary wastewater treatment. alternative coagulants, particularly ones that contain stable cationic species, offer municipalities improved removal of plastic contaminants under these challenging treatment conditions.

Murakami Hiroyuki Matsuzaki,"perovskite solar cells (pscs) based on narrow-bandgap formamidinium lead halide (fapbi3) photoabsorber have garnered substantial attention owing to their high photovoltaic (pv) performances. extensive studies have established that the introduction of methylammonium chloride (macl) significantly improves the bulk quality of fapbi3 so commonly used; while heating the photoabsorber’s precursor film, the incorporated macl facilitates the crystalline growth of fapbi3, simultaneously volatilizing and dissipating from the perovskite layer. however, not only the photoabsorber's bulk quality but also heterointerfaces between the photoabsorber and carrier transport materials importantly contribute to the pv performances. paradoxically, the macl effects on fapbi3 heterointerfaces have been sparingly explored and consequently remained elusive. herein, the effects of macl on these heterointerfaces are unveiled by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity. the macl additive accelerates carrier injections from fapbi3 to the carrier transport materials presumably owing to the occurrence of spontaneous modulation of the heterointerfaces. in particular, at the heterointerface between fapbi3 and the titanium oxide (tio2) electron transport layer, an emissive interlayer that is chloride-containing and wide-bandgap (fapbi3-xclx) is formed spontaneously, which most likely serves multiple advantages leading to the observed pv performance enhancement: hole blocking and facilitation of electron injection from fapbi3 to tio2 without additional hole trapping. consequently, the present results provide novel insights into the widely employed macl additive in fapbi3 photoabsorbers and thereby propels the further advancement of pscs. furthermore, this study demonstrates effective investigation of carrier dynamics with regard to the heterointerface, which is challenging, using potent time-resolved spectroscopies, so will promote development in the material sciences."

Gilson Tom Kurtzman,"the concept that a fluid has a position-dependent free energy density appears in the literature but has not been fully developed or accepted. we set this concept on an unambiguous theoretical footing via the following strategy. first, we set forth four desiderata that should be satisfied by any definition of the position-dependent free energy density, f(r), in a system comprising only a fluid and a rigid solute: its volume integral, plus the fixed internal energy of the solute, should be the system free energy; it deviates from its bulk value, f_bulk, near a solute but should asymptotically approach f_bulk with increasing distance from the solute; it should go to zero where the solvent density goes to zero; and it should be well-defined in the most general case of a fluid made up of flexible molecules with an arbitrary interaction potential. second, we use statistical thermodynamics to formulate a definition of the free energy density that satisfies these desiderata. third, we show how any free energy density satisfying the desiderata may be used to analyze molecular processes in solution. in particular, because the spatial integral of f(r) equals the free energy of the system, it can be used to compute free energy changes that result from the rearrangement of solutes, as well as the forces exerted on the solutes by the solvent. in particular, we discuss the thermodynamic analysis of water in protein binding sites to inform ligand design. finally, we discuss related literature and address published concerns regarding the thermodynamic plausibility of a position-dependent free energy density. the theory presented here has applications in theoretical and computational chemistry and may be further generalizable beyond fluids, such as to solids and macromolecules.

(4). we synthesized aspirin nhs ester (aspirin-nhs) to capitalize on this versatility in acetylating biomolecules. this tailored approach allows for the selective targeting of lysine residues within proteins, offering a specific tool to examine the functional consequences of lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. for this study, a model protein system was used. we selected β-conglycinin, a soy protein, that offers a pragmatic platform for investigating lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. β-conglycinin is rich in lysine residues, similar to nf-κb, making it homologous to this line of inquiry (5). we can examine the theoretical considerations of lysine acetylation with practical experimental observations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory dynamics within the nf-κb complex. this research contributes not only to the expanding toolkit for precise protein acetylation modulation but also enhances our understanding of nf-κb's regulatory dynamics in the context of cancer, establishing a bridge between chemical synthesis and biological investigation.

See,"new energy storage methods are emerging to increase the energy density of the state-of-the-art battery systems beyond the conventional intercalation electrode materials. for instance, employing anion redox can yield higher capacities compared to transition metal redox alone. anion redox in sulfides has been recognized since the early days of rechargeable battery research. however, now we aim to understand the charge compensation mechanisms and how to control them. here, we study the effect of d-p overlap in controlling anion redox by shifting the metal d band position relative to the s p band. we aim to determine the effect of shifting the d band position on the electronic structure and ultimately on charge compensation. two isostructural sulfides linafes2 and linacos2 are directly compared with the hypothesis that the co material should yield more covalent metal-anion bonds. the newly reported material linacos2 exhibits multielectron capacity of >/=1.7 electrons per formula unit, but despite the lowered co d band, the voltage of anion redox is close to that of linafes2. interestingly, the material suffers from rapid capacity fade. through a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, co and s x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and partial density of states calculations, we demonstrate that s oxidation to [s2]2- occurs in early states of charge which leads to an irreversible phase transition into pyrite cos2 and lithiated cobalt spinel phases such as lixco3s4 and lixco9s8. thus, we conclude that anion oxidation occurs from s nonbonding p orbitals and the co d bands are too low in energy to prevent a phase transition to more thermodynamically stable persulfide-containing phases. further, the higher crystal field stabilization energy for octahedral coordination over tetrahedral coordination leads to phase transition in linacos2."

Josephson,"1,4-dioxane is an emerging water pollutant with high production volumes and a probable human carcinogen. the incompetence of conventional treatment processes demonstrates a need for an effective remediation strategy. crystalline nanoporous materials are cost-effective adsorbents due to their high capacity and selective separation in mixtures. this study explores the potency of all-silica zeolites. these zeolites are highly hydrophobic and can preferentially adsorb nonpolar molecules from mixtures. we investigated six zeolite frameworks (bea, euo, fer, ifr, mfi, mor) using monte carlo simulations in the gibbs ensemble. the simulations indicate high selectivity by fer and euo, especially at low pressures, which we attribute to pore sizes and shapes with more affinity to 1,4-dioxane. we also demonstrate a monte carlo simulation workflow using gauge cells to model the adsorption of an aqueous solution of 1,4-dioxane at 0.35 ppb concentration. we quantify 1,4-dioxane and water coadsorption and observe selectivities ranging from 1.1 x 10^5 in mor to 8.7 x 10^6 in fer. we also demonstrate that 1,4-dioxane is in the infinite dilution regime in both the aqueous and adsorbed phases at this concentration. this simulation technique can be extended to model other emerging water contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas), chlorates, and others, which are also found in extremely low concentrations.

Csernica Kit McColl Grace M. Busse Kipil Lim Diego F. Rivera David A. Shapiro M. Saiful Islam William C. Chueh,"delithiation of layered oxide electrodes triggers irreversible oxygen loss, one of the primary degradation modes in lithium-ion batteries. however, the delithiation-dependent mechanisms of oxygen loss remain poorly understood. here, we investigate the oxygen nonstoichiometry in li- and mn-rich li1.18-xni0.21mn0.53co0.08o2-δ electrodes as a function of li content by utilizing cycling protocols with long open-circuit voltage steps at varying states of charge. surprisingly, we observe significant oxygen loss even at moderate delithiation, corresponding to 2.5, 4.0 and 7.6 ml o2 g-1 after resting at 135, 200, and 265 mah g-1 (relative to the pristine material) for 100 h. our observations suggest an intrinsic oxygen instability consistent with predictions of high equilibrium oxygen activity at intermediate potentials. from a mechanistic viewpoint, we show that cation disorder greatly lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy by decreasing the coordination number of transition metals to certain oxygen ions. in addition, we observe a large chemical expansion coefficient with respect to oxygen nonstoichiometry, which is about three times greater than those of classical oxygen-deficient materials such as fluorite and perovskite oxides. our work challenges the conventional wisdom that deep delithiation is a necessary condition for oxygen loss in layered oxide electrodes and highlights the importance of calendar aging for investigating oxygen stability."

Rabinowitz,"orbitrap mass spectrometry in full scan mode enables simultaneous detection of hundreds of metabolites and their isotope-labeled forms. yet sensitivity remains limiting for many metabolites, including low concentration species, poor ionizers, and low fractional abundance isotope-labeled forms in isotope tracing studies. here we explore selected ion monitoring (sim) as a means of sensitivity enhancement. the analytes of interest are enriched in the orbitrap analyzer by using the quadrupole as a mass filter to select particular ions. in tissue extracts, sim significantly enhances the detection of ions of low intensity as indicated by improved signal-to-noise (s/n) ratios and measurement precision. in addition, sim improves the accuracy of isotope-ratio measurements. sim, however, must be deployed with care, as excessive accumulation in the orbitrap of similar m/z ions can lead, via space charge effects, to decreased performance (signal loss, mass shift, ion coalescence). ion accumulation can be controlled by adjusting settings including injection time and target ion quantity. overall, we suggest using full scan to ensure broad metabolic coverage, in tandem with sim for accurate quantitation of targeted low-intensity ions, and provide methods deploying this approach to enhance metabolome coverage.

M. Nielsen Boris  Le Guennic Thomas Just Sørensen,"the structure of molecular systems dictates the physical properties, and symmetry is determining for all electronic properties. this makes group theory a powerful tool in quantum mechanics, when computing molecular properties. for inorganic compounds, the coordination geometry has been estimated as idealized polyhedra of high symmetry, which through ligand field theory provides predictive capabilities. however, real samples rarely have ideal symmetry, and even though continuous symmetry measures can be used to evaluate deviation form ideal symmetry, this often fails for lanthanide(iii) complexes with high coordination numbers and no obvious principal axis. in lanthanide complexes, the unique electronic structures and the associated properties are intricately tied to the symmetry around the lanthanide center. robust methodologies to evaluate and estimate point group symmetry is therefore instrumental for building structure property relationships. here, we have demonstrated an algorithmic approach that determines the principal axis, and computes a deviation from ideal symmetry. this approach is based on the continuous symmetry measures and evaluates deviations from ideal symmetry for each symmetry operation in all relevant point groups. to demonstrate the methodology we have investigated the structure and symmetry of 8 and 9 coordinated lanthanide(iii) aqua complexes, and correlated the luminescence from 3 europium(iii) crystals to their actual symmetry. to document the methodology the approach has been tested on 26 molecules with different symmetry. it was concluded that the method is robust and fully autonomous."
