Stephen Trent Jennifer Brodbelt," gram-negative bacteria develop and exhibit resistance to antibiotics owing to their highly  asymmetric outer membrane maintained by a group of six proteins comprising the mla (maintenance of  lipid asymmetry) pathway. here we investigate the lipid binding preferences of one mla protein, mlac,  which transports lipids through the periplasm. we used ultraviolet photodissociation (uvpd) to identify  and characterize modifications of lipids endogenously bound to mlac expressed in three different bacteria  strains. uvpd was also used to localize lipid binding to mlac residues 130-140, consistent with the crystal  structure reported for lipid-bound mlac. the impact of removing the bound lipid from mlac on its  structure was monitored based on collision cross section measurements, revealing that the protein  unfolded prior to release of the lipid. the lipid selectivity of mlac was evaluated based on titrimetric  experiments, indicating that mlac bound lipids in various classes (sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids,  fatty acids) as long as they possessed no more than two acyl chains."

Seifried Sepehr  Nikkho Aurelio  Morales Murillo Lucas J.  Andrew Edward R.  Grant Allan K. Bertram,"recent research has shown that microplastics are widespread in the atmosphere. however, we know little about their ability to nucleate ice and impact cloud glaciation. ice nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distributions. the present study explores the heterogeneous ice nucleation activity of seven microplastic samples in the immersion-freezing mode. two polypropylene and one polyethylene terephthalate sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of -20.9°c, -23.2°c and -21.9°c, respectively. the number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, n_s (t), ranged from 10-1 to 104 cm-2 in a temperature interval of -15 to -25°c, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and fungal spores. after exposure to ozone or a combination of uv light and ozone, simulating atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged in others. an initial assessment using microplastic concentrations reported in the literature and our freezing data suggest that microplastics may influence cloud glaciation in some situations, but more studies are needed to confirm this initial assessment. ice nucleation by microplastics may also impact their long-range transport and global distribution of microplastics based on a comparison of our freezing results and those of fungal spores.

Schunk Schirin Hanf,"herein we report the use of supported nanoparticles of crystalline rhodium sulphides as active heterogeneous catalysts for the hydroformylation of alkenes showing an excellent selectivity towards the aldehyde products. it was found that supported rhxsy (x=17, y=15 or x=2, y=3 with 1 and 10 wt.% rh) nanoparticles greatly outperform pure rh nanoparticles in terms of activity, with rh17s15/sio2 being the superior catalyst candidate. the tof for the hydroformylation of styrene, determined for the lead system rh17s15/sio2 (1 wt.% rh), is with 2620 h-1 significantly higher than tof values reported for rhodium phosphide-based systems. as the presence of s in the rh sulphides introduces structural diversity in the bulk as well as the range of potential catalytic surfaces, we enumerate all possible terminations, use local environment descriptors combined with unsupervised machine learning techniques and dft to draw structure performance relationships. we find that the presence of s on the surface and in close proximity to the catalytic site had a profound impact on the chemical behavior of the catalyst, thus unlocking the tunability of the surface catalytic properties. this allows for the affinity towards the substrate to be modulated to a high degree ranging from s rich rh-top like sites of low; to rh rich, and in particular for rh17s15, (rh4) sites with adsorption energies rivaling those of pristine rh and improved spatial resolution."

Zondlo,"nmr spectroscopy is the most important technique for understanding the structure of peptides and proteins in solution, providing information at the single-residue and single-atom level. however, written instruction in the interpretation of nmr spectra of peptides and proteins is generally focused on advanced techniques and highly complex spectra, with a lack of simple spectra and guides available for beginning students. in order to address this instructional limitation, we have generated a dataset of 1h nmr spectra of a series of simple peptides that include all canonical amino acids. peptides examined include ac-x(s/ps)-nh2, ac-x(t/pt)-nh2, and ac-xppgy-nh2, where x = all encoded amino acids, ps = phosphorylated ser, and pt = phosphorylated thr. the characterization of each peptide includes a 1-d spectrum and a tocsy spectrum, with both the raw and processed available. the spectra can be used for instructional applications including analysis of regions of the spectra (e.g. amide hn, aromatic, hα, and aliphatic regions); identification of spin systems and residue assignment via tocsy spectra; analysis of conformational features including amide hn chemical shift dispersion and changes due to hydrogen bonding or post-translational modifications; the 3jαn coupling constant that reports on the φ torsion angle and on order versus disorder at a given residue; conformational preferences at hα via chemical shift index analysis; understanding of diastereotopic hydrogens; dynamic processes, including hydrogen exchange; and identification of proline cis-trans isomerism. in addition, for a limited number of peptides, noesy spectra are included to allow sequential resonance assignment and for assignment of trans versus cis proline conformations. spectra from closely related peptides allow the analysis of the relative effects of single amino acid changes. the paper is written to be directly accessible to students as a tutorial guide. in addition, the data can be used by instructors for problem sets and exams.

Hancock Erica Giudici Lars Goerigk," time-dependent double hybrids with spin-component or spin-opposite scaling to their second-order perturbative correlation correction have demonstrated competitive robustness in the computation of electronic excitation energies. some of the most robust are those recently published by our group [m. casanova-páez, l. goerigk, j. chem. theory comput. 2021, 20, 5165]. so far, the implementation of these functionals has not allowed correctly calculating their ground-state total energies. herein, we define their correct spin-scaled ground-state energy expressions which enables us to test our methods on the noncovalent excited-state interaction energies of four aromatic excimers. a range of 22 double hybrids with and without spin scaling are compared to the reasonably accurate wavefunction reference from our previous work [a. c. hancock, l. goerigk, rsc adv. 2023, 13, 35964]. the impact of spin scaling is highly dependent on the underlying functional expression, however, the smallest overall errors belong to spin-scaled functionals with range separation: scs- and sos-ωpbepp86, and scs-rsx-qidh. we additionally determine parameters for dft-d3(bj)/d4 ground-state dispersion corrections of these functionals, which reduce errors in most cases. we highlight the necessity of dispersion corrections for even the most robust td-dft methods but also point out that ground-state based corrections are insufficient to completely capture dispersion effects for excited-state interaction energies."

Alexandrova,"dynamic restructuring of cu electrode has been observed under electrochemical conditions, and it has been hypothesized to underly the unique reactivity of cu towards co2 electroreduction. surface roughening is one of the key surface phenomena to cu activation, in which the surface forms numerous atomic vacancies and adatoms. however, the atomic structure of such surface motifs, in the presence of relevant adsorbates has remained elusive. here, we explore the chemical space of cu surface restructuring under coverage of co and h in realistic electroreduction conditions, by a combination of grand canonical density functional theory and global optimization techniques, from which we construct a potential-dependent grand canonical ensemble representation of the surface. significant vertical displacement of  surface cu atoms is observed in the regime of intermediate and mixed co and h coverage. this regime, while predicted to be thermodynamically inaccessible, is kinetically controlled, presenting a tough challenge for theory. to investigate the kinetic trapping effects, we develop a quasi-kinetic monte carlo simulation to track the evolution of the system during a simulated cathodic scan. the simulation reveals the path that the system takes across the coverage space and the metastable structures that the system evolves into along the way. chemical bonding analysis is performed on the metastable structures with elevated cu*co species to understand its formation mechanism. by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, the surface chemistry of the cu*co species is explored, and we identifies potential mechanisms via which the cu*co species may diffuse or dimerize. this work provides rich atomistic insights into the surface roughening phenomenon and the structure of the involved species. it also features generalizable methods to explore the chemical space of restructuring surfaces with mixed adsorbates, and its evolution in non-equilibrium."

Martin Bollinger Jr.,"hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (h6h) is an fe(ii)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (fe/2og) oxygenase that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of scopolamine, a prolifically administered anti-nausea drug. after its namesake first reaction, h6h couples the newly installed c6-bonded oxygen to c7 to form the epoxide of scopolamine. oxoiron(iv) (ferryl) intermediates initiate both reactions by cleaving c–h bonds, but it remains unclear how the enzyme switches target site and promotes (c6)o–c7 coupling in preference to c7 hydroxylation in the second step. in one possible epoxidation mechanism, the c6 oxygen would – analogously to mechanisms proposed for the fe/2og halogenases and, in a parallel study, n-acetylnorloline synthase (lolo) – coordinate as alkoxide to the c7–h-cleaving ferryl intermediate to enable alkoxyl coupling to the ensuing c7 radical. here we provide structural and kinetic evidence that h6h instead exploits the distinct spatial dependencies of competitive c–h-cleavage (c6 vs c7) and c–o-coupling (oxygen rebound vs cyclization) steps to promote the two-step sequence without substrate coordination or repositioning for the epoxidation step. structural comparisons of ferryl-mimicking vanadyl complexes of wild-type h6h and a variant that preferentially 7-hydroxylates instead of epoxidizing 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine suggest that only a modest (~ 10°) shift in the fe–o–h(c7) approach angle is sufficient to change the outcome. the observation that, in wild-type h6h, ²h₂o solvent also increases the c7-hydroxylation:epoxidation ratio by ~ 8-fold implies that the latter outcome requires cleavage of the alcohol o-h bond, which, unlike in the lolo oxacyclization, is not accomplished in advance of c–h cleavage."

Kurusu  Nathalie Tufenkji," due to growing concerns of plastic pollution release into water bodies, it is imperative to understand and assess the removal of nanoplastics and microplastics during wastewater treatment processes. although earlier studies have shown high removal of plastic contaminants during coagulation, flocculation and settling, a limited number of experiments have examined the removal of nanoplastics in relevant water chemistries including higher ph values and in the presence of organics. in this study, the removal of nanoplastics and microfibers is assessed using conventional (alum) and alternative coagulants including aluminum chlorohydrate (ach) and cationic polyamines (pdadmac) in a synthetic wastewater matrix for ph conditions between 7 and 8.6. our results show that plastic removal is considerably reduced at higher ph values when alum is used as a coagulant. at the shorter settling time of 30 s, removal of pristine and aged nanoplastics declined from 64 ± 3% and 76 ± 3% respectively (ph 7) to less than 20% at ph values higher than 7.8.  similarly, polyester microfiber removal was observed to decline from 97 ± 1% at ph 7 to 85 ± 3% at ph 8.6 for samples collected after 3 min of settling. replacing alum with polynuclear aluminum coagulants resulted in greater plastic contaminant removal at ph values above 8 with a maximum observed microfiber removal of 95 ± 1% (ach; ph 8.6; 3 min settling time) and a maximum observed nanoplastic removal of 71 ± 5% (ach+pdadmac; ph 8.2; 30 s settling time). quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (qcm-d) measurements revealed that ach coagulant species results in a thicker deposition layer on negatively charged surfaces compared to alum. the addition of pdadmac to ach led to a more favorable interaction with a model negatively charged surface, indicated by a faster and more rigid deposition of the alternative coagulant. taken together, these results show that environmental conditions, including water ph and interactions with wastewater colloids, affect plastic contaminant removal during primary wastewater treatment. alternative coagulants, particularly ones that contain stable cationic species, offer municipalities improved removal of plastic contaminants under these challenging treatment conditions.

Campbell Bjoern Braunschweig,"in many applications of polyelectrolyte/surfactant (p/s) mixtures, it is difficult to fine-tune them after mixing the components without changing the sample composition, e.g. ph or the ionic strength. here we report on a new approach where we use photoswitchable surfactants to enable drastic changes in both the bulk and interfacial properties. poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (pdadmac) mixtures with three alkyl-arylazopyrazole butyl sulfonates (cnaap) with -h, -butyl and -octyl tails are applied and e/z photoisomerization of the surfactants is used to cause substantially different hydrophobic interactions between the surfactants and pdadmac. this affects significantly the p/s binding and allows for tuning both the bulk and interfacial properties of pdadmac/cnaap mixtures through light irradiation. for that, we have fixed the surfactant concentrations at values where they exhibit pronounced surface tension changes upon e/z photoisomerization with 365 nm uv light (z) and 520 nm green (e) light and have varied the pdadmac concentration. the electrophoretic mobility can be largely tuned by photoisomerisation of cnaap surfactants and p/s aggregates, which can even exhibit a charge reversal from negative to positive values or vice versa. in addition, low colloidal stability at equimolar concentrations of pdadmac with cnaap surfactants in the e configuration lead to the formation of large aggregates in the bulk which can be redissolved by irradiation with uv light when the surfactant‘s alkyl chain is short enough (c0aap). vibrational sum-frequency generation (sfg) reveals changes at the interface similar to the bulk, where the charging state at air-water interfaces can be modified with light irradiation. using sfg spectroscopy, we interrogated the o-h stretching modes of interfacial h2o and provide qualitative information on surface charging that is complemented by neutron reflectometry, from which we resolved the surface excess of pdadmac and cnaap at the air-water interface, independently.

Gilson Tom Kurtzman,"the concept that a fluid has a position-dependent free energy density appears in the literature but has not been fully developed or accepted. we set this concept on an unambiguous theoretical footing via the following strategy. first, we set forth four desiderata that should be satisfied by any definition of the position-dependent free energy density, f(r), in a system comprising only a fluid and a rigid solute: its volume integral, plus the fixed internal energy of the solute, should be the system free energy; it deviates from its bulk value, f_bulk, near a solute but should asymptotically approach f_bulk with increasing distance from the solute; it should go to zero where the solvent density goes to zero; and it should be well-defined in the most general case of a fluid made up of flexible molecules with an arbitrary interaction potential. second, we use statistical thermodynamics to formulate a definition of the free energy density that satisfies these desiderata. third, we show how any free energy density satisfying the desiderata may be used to analyze molecular processes in solution. in particular, because the spatial integral of f(r) equals the free energy of the system, it can be used to compute free energy changes that result from the rearrangement of solutes, as well as the forces exerted on the solutes by the solvent. in particular, we discuss the thermodynamic analysis of water in protein binding sites to inform ligand design. finally, we discuss related literature and address published concerns regarding the thermodynamic plausibility of a position-dependent free energy density. the theory presented here has applications in theoretical and computational chemistry and may be further generalizable beyond fluids, such as to solids and macromolecules.

(4). we synthesized aspirin nhs ester (aspirin-nhs) to capitalize on this versatility in acetylating biomolecules. this tailored approach allows for the selective targeting of lysine residues within proteins, offering a specific tool to examine the functional consequences of lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. for this study, a model protein system was used. we selected β-conglycinin, a soy protein, that offers a pragmatic platform for investigating lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. β-conglycinin is rich in lysine residues, similar to nf-κb, making it homologous to this line of inquiry (5). we can examine the theoretical considerations of lysine acetylation with practical experimental observations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory dynamics within the nf-κb complex. this research contributes not only to the expanding toolkit for precise protein acetylation modulation but also enhances our understanding of nf-κb's regulatory dynamics in the context of cancer, establishing a bridge between chemical synthesis and biological investigation.

Alexandrova,"nontrivial surface states in topological materials have emerged as exciting targets for surface chemistry research. in particular, topological insulators have been utilized as electrodes in electrocatalytic reactions. herein, we investigate the robustness of topological surface states and band topology under electrochemical conditions, specifically in the presence of an electric double layer. first-principles band structure calculations are performed on the electrified (001) surfaces of bi2te3, bi2se3, and sb2te3 using an implicit electrolyte model. our results demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of the surface states upon surface charging. under oxidizing potentials, the surface states are shifted upward in energy, preserving the dirac point on the surface and the band inversion in the bulk. conversely, under reducing potentials, hybridization is observed between the surface and bulk states, suggesting a likely breakdown of topological protection. the position of the fermi level, which dictates the working states in catalytic reactions, should ideally be confined within the bulk bandgap. this requirement defines a potential window for the effective application of topological electrocatalysis."

See,"new energy storage methods are emerging to increase the energy density of the state-of-the-art battery systems beyond the conventional intercalation electrode materials. for instance, employing anion redox can yield higher capacities compared to transition metal redox alone. anion redox in sulfides has been recognized since the early days of rechargeable battery research. however, now we aim to understand the charge compensation mechanisms and how to control them. here, we study the effect of d-p overlap in controlling anion redox by shifting the metal d band position relative to the s p band. we aim to determine the effect of shifting the d band position on the electronic structure and ultimately on charge compensation. two isostructural sulfides linafes2 and linacos2 are directly compared with the hypothesis that the co material should yield more covalent metal-anion bonds. the newly reported material linacos2 exhibits multielectron capacity of >/=1.7 electrons per formula unit, but despite the lowered co d band, the voltage of anion redox is close to that of linafes2. interestingly, the material suffers from rapid capacity fade. through a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, co and s x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and partial density of states calculations, we demonstrate that s oxidation to [s2]2- occurs in early states of charge which leads to an irreversible phase transition into pyrite cos2 and lithiated cobalt spinel phases such as lixco3s4 and lixco9s8. thus, we conclude that anion oxidation occurs from s nonbonding p orbitals and the co d bands are too low in energy to prevent a phase transition to more thermodynamically stable persulfide-containing phases. further, the higher crystal field stabilization energy for octahedral coordination over tetrahedral coordination leads to phase transition in linacos2."

Stephens Maria-Magdalena Titirici,"phasing out petrochemical-based thermoplastics with bio-plastics produced in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly way is of paramount interest. among them, polylactic acid (pla) is the flagship with its production accounting for 19% of the entire bioplastics industry. glycerol electrolysis for producing the monomer lactic acid, while co-generating green h2, represents a promising approach to boost the production of pla, yet the reaction selectivity has been a bottleneck. here, we report a combined electrochemical and chemical route using a tandem pt/c-γ-al2o3 multicomponent catalyst which can achieve a glycerol-to-lactic acid selectivity of 60.2 ± 2.7%, among the highest performance reported so far. combining an experimental and computational mechanistic analysis, we suggest that tuning the acidic sites on catalyst surface is crucial for shifting the reaction towards the dehydration pathway, occurring via dihydroxyacetone intermediate. within the tandem effect, pt is the active site to electrochemically catalyze glycerol to dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde, while the γ-al2o3 provides the required acidic sites for catalyzing dihydroxyacetone to the pyruvaldehyde intermediate, which will then go through cannizzaro rearrangement, catalyzed by the oh- ions to form lactic acid.  this catalytic synergy improves the selectivity towards lactic acid by nearly two-fold. a selectivity descriptor (δg_(glad^* )-δg_(dha^* )) from density functional theory calculations was identified, which could be used to screen other materials in further research. our findings highlight the promise of tandem electrolysis  in the development of strategies for selective electrochemical production of high-value commodity chemicals from low value (waste) precursors."

Dudek Stefan  Kaskel Dariusz Matoga,"dynamic multicomponent metal-organic frameworks, comprising numerous functional groups attached to a flexible backbone, expedite the complexity of coordination chemistry. both factors, stimuli-responsiveness, and non-homogeneous environ-ments, are pivotal for creating complex systems that bring scientists closer to understanding biological structures, nevertheless, com-prehension of such systems remains largely unexplored. inspired by this concept, we prepared a series of flexible multivariate juk-8(no2)x(br)1-x (0 < x < 1) compounds (mtv-mofs) and introduced experimental and theoretical methodologies for their investiga-tion. 1h-nmr was employed to determine the molar fraction of the linker in the bulk sample, whereas single crystal x-ray diffraction verified this value for single crystals. co2 adsorption studies at 195 k revealed that the monosubstituted juk-8(no2) transitioned from a less porous to a porous phase at p/p0 ~ 0.20, while for juk-8(br), this process occurred at p/p0 ~ 0.58. for the mtv-mofs, in contrast to the anticipated steady increase in transformation pressure with the molar fraction of br-pip, xbr, we observed a constant gate opening pressure, p/p0 ~ 0.33, across a broad range of xbr,  0.27-0.63, and then its gradual increase up to p/p0 ~ 0.48 for xbr up to 0.96. resolving the crystal structure of the closed phases of juk-8(br) and juk-8(no2) allowed us to identify the crucial interactions governing this phenomenon. finally, by constructing theo-retical models of a multivariate structure and employing solid-state nmr crystallography supported by dft simulation, we shed light on the possible spatial arrangement of functional groups in juk-8(no2)0.50(br)0.50. overall, our report introduces a methodology that could potentially be utilized for investigating multicomponent flexible mofs.
